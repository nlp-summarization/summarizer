So a lot of walkers looking to increase their calorie burn carted around hand weights instead.Now vests made for walkers have hit the market. They range from 4 to 30 pounds, and many are adjustable.The makers of these vests (which can vary in price based on their weight) say they are safer, more effective alternatives to hand weights, which can strain shoulders and elbows.Some biomechanics researchers agree. ''The best place to put weight is evenly distributed on the trunk,'' said Peter Francis, an emeritus professor of exercise at San Diego State University.A 2006 University of Iowa study published in the journal Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise also found that walking with a weighted vest can raise caloric burn by about 7 percent and increase exercise intensity.Mark Fenton, a former racewalker and the author of ''The Complete Guide to Walking for Health, Weight Loss and Fitness,'' wore vests during 2 to 3 mile walks on varied terrain and doing calisthenics.SARAH BOWEN SHEA</text></article><article id="1829595"><summary>Correction on Jan 25 article about environmental impact of consumers' clothing-buying habits</summary><text>A headline and article on Jan. 25 about the environmental impact of consumers' clothing-buying habits referred incorrectly to a test by Cambridge University researchers that compared the energy required to make and clean an organic cotton T-shirt to that required for a synthetic blouse.

You half expect to hear Ted Nugent ranting in the background. Nugent would probably prefer to be seen at a vegetarian restaurant than at a self-consciously unselfconscious hipster boutique, but there is something endearingly earnest about the store's attempt to distance itself from the fripperies of fashion with a capital F.The focus here is clearly on authentic work wear and on the trappings of masculinity -- in other words, on the importance of being Ernest Hemingway. Which explains why there are no man jewels available at this Big Papa's House -- not even a fob watch -- only blokey gadgets like a Surefire flashlight ($110) and a Leatherman all-in-one tool kit ($89).Gearheads will appreciate that the Leatherman, essentially a beefed-up Swiss Army knife, is sold in limited-edition black as opposed to the standard-issue chrome. And I was assured by the incredibly friendly and hirsute staff, who look as if they play in a fiddle band on the weekends, that the gizmo was made for the Army Special Forces.It's mucho macho posturing that would border on laughable were it not for the consistently on-target product selection. The disappointingly drab T-shirts ($54) were as appealing to me as leftover venison, but it's hard to fault the in-house line of ruggedly unobtrusive work shirts ($178) or the assortment of unlined shirt jackets ($298) -- shackets? -- which are good lightweight cover-ups or layering pieces.While there is not much in the way of accessories, the handmade belts by Matt Brown ($165) -- hung from the store's newest addition, a moose head -- have enough built-in adventurer hardware to appeal to aspiring Peter Beards. Also worthwhile is the small but impressive selection of no-nonsense footwear. Standouts include cowhide tracker boots ($160) and bison grizzly boots with deerskin lining ($200) made by Quoddy, fifth-generation moccasin makers from Maine. The all-natural hand-stitched rubber wellies by the French company Le Chameau are, at $390, a tad expensive for my liking, even if they are lined with pigskin and are the preferred weekend mud boots for the European aristo horsey set. At the end of the day, I want to pay as little as possible to look like Rupert Bear.Also on the steep end are the store's much-touted in-house suits (from $2,000). Made from dead-stock vintage fabric, they are available in three styles: standard, slimline and three-button.In fairness, they are handmade by the redoubtable Brooklyn tailor Martin Greenfield, who has measured the inside seam of presidents from Eisenhower to Clinton, but I balk at paying designer prices for nondesigner clothing. And judging from the full racks, I suspect that I am not the only one. Amid the rest of the well-priced fare, the suits stand out like pacifists at an N.R.A. rally. (For urban hunter-gatherers not on a budget, there is also a custom tailoring service available for around $3,000.)Much better bang for your buckshot are the derring-do doodads scattered around the place. The decoupage serving plates ($105) by John Derian feature images of old-school prizefighters with their dukes up and are a knockout addition to any bach pad. So, too, are the store's impressive lighting fixtures ($300 to $1200), for which the owners scour the Northeast.And for those intimate nights &#224; deux on the bear rug, there is also a selection of handsome but sturdy glassware with pewter bases. (Prices range from $30 for a shot glass to $150 for a martini pitcher.)Even if you have reached your bag limit for the season, it's worth visiting Freemans Sporting Club for the barbershop out back. In keeping with the rest of the store, the barbershop speaks in a thick ye olde worlde accent, right down to the vintage Oster clippers and the antique chairs from the 1920s and '30s.Unlike the staff at a lot of places that offer similar services, the three barbers all have a background in hairstyling and clearly understand their downtown crowd. The deliberately unkempt rocker look requires special maintenance -- ''subtle thinning and layering,'' my barber assured me.In truth, a stuffed moose could cut what little hair I have left, but I don't recall being more impressed by a buzz cut ($25). And if the haircut the person in the chair next to me came away with ($40) is any indication, there are few better places below Harlem for a decent fade.Not surprisingly, the barbershop also stocks plenty of obscure apothecary-style grooming products, including handmade razors with ivory handles ($86 to $120) and badger shaving brushes ($69 to $200) by the British gentleman's company Edwin Jagger; shaving creams ($12) and pomades ($20) from Geo. F. Trumper; even bone-handle toothbrushes ($24) and tooth picks ($7) from D. R. Harris. All the better to dislodge those pesky bits of wild boar.Freemans Sporting Club  8 Rivington Street (between Bowery and Chrystie Street, at Freeman Alley); (212) 673-3209ATMOSPHERE -- Stag party!

Well, the eye adjusts, as they say in the trade. Now shoppers are embracing this voluminous shape, and in particular its keystone: a short, unstructured jacket that just grazes the top of the hips.At a time when trends seem as disposable as the cast of ''24,'' the flyaway jacket has staying power and is emerging as the first retail hit of the spring.Introduced more than a year ago in collections like Chlo&#233;, Marni and Marc Jacobs, trapeze jackets are in demand at Barneys New York, selling as romantic complements to dresses that arc wide from the shoulders.''Our customers are not shying away from the look of volume over volume,'' said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director. ''Spring is a season of dresses, and flyaway jackets polish them perfectly.''At H&amp;M, cropped free-swinging styles are replacing cardigans as a cover for tunics, slim jeans and frothy party frocks. Offered in a high-low range of fabrics from denim to brocade, and priced from $30 to $60, they are an immense success, said Lisa Sandberg, a company spokeswoman.Other interpretations include a pyramid shape with dainty ruffled cuffs by Peter Som, a streamlined alternative with a delicately gathered collar by Behnaz Sarafpour, a floral patterned jacket by Barbara Tfank and a khaki-tone cropped style from Banana Republic. J. Crew has given its round-collar version an all-American flavor, offering it in a jaunty plaid cotton so light that it could double as a shirt.At the Scoop stores in Manhattan, customers are partial to a tent-shaped cotton canvas jacket by Anya Hindmarch ($575). ''It is ladylike without being overly serious,'' said Danielle de Marne, the Scoop fashion director.Ports 1961 has a version that is flirtatiously pleated at the neck. Sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, it resembles a shrunken poncho but has a distinctly patrician air. Among its attractions are its '50s-inspired three-quarter raglan sleeves.''The most beautiful part of a woman is her wrists,'' said Tia Cibani, its designer. ''This gives me a chance to show them off.''Front Row</text></article><article id="1829599"><summary>Guy Trebay reviews Paris runway shows of Viktor &amp; Rolf, Balenciaga, Jean Paul Gaultier and others; photos (M)</summary><text>WHEN it comes to figuring out what drives fashion and what the people who make it may be trying to tell us, sometimes a light bulb goes on, literally. This occurred on Monday at the Viktor &amp; Rolf show, when the Dutch designers staged a runway presentation that had each model entering a darkened space with an elaborate metal armature protruding from her clothing and equipped with speakers playing different strains of music and spotlights that framed her in a solitary nimbus.The obvious message, that we are fast becoming solipsistic units of consumption, each moving around in an alienated personal theater of the self, barely merits a yawn. And the point could have been made less cumbersomely had each model come out with her iPod ear buds plugged in and illuminated in the eerie blue glow of a P.D.A. or a cellphone.Behind a lugubrious staging that did little to disguise some fairly clunky designs was another and more urgent communication, one that already looks like a theme. You could detect it in the perverse high-heeled wooden clogs the models were made to wear at Viktor &amp; Rolf and the patterns in the clothes -- taken, the designers said later, from Dutch folk costumes and tapestry.You could note it again at a Balenciaga show that invoked so many of what used to be called ethnic influences -- kimono, ikat prints, folk embroideries from Eastern Europe, Moroccan coin ornaments, Peruvian peasant blankets and Tyrolean boiled wool -- that it seemed like a luxury goods tour bus had crashed into an outlet of Crafts Caravan.You could even detect the motif in a kooky gesture Jean Paul Gaultier made at his show, which opened with the Canadian model Coco Rocha performing a Celtic dance. (As it happens, Ms. Rocha was discovered at an Irish dance festival; those model scouts really get around.)Good reasons exist to feel nostalgia for a time before industrial corporate culture had begun flattening the dimensions of the global landscape; fashion designers have no corner on that sentiment. But as the most obvious beneficiaries of cross-cultural pollination and the visual wealth of traditional folkways, designers who are sounding the alarm on global homogenization make a certain kind of sense. This is not to suggest that any of them were consciously doing so.''It's a street mix, with symbols and colors that are very multicultural,'' Nicolas Ghesquiere told Style.com before the Balenciaga show. It was a curious thing to hear from a designer based in a place where memories of the 2005 class and race riots remain fresh and in a country where a platform of inclusion may turn out to have been a drag on the political aspirations of the Socialist Party candidate for the French presidency, S&#233;gol&#232;ne Royal.It is probably worth remembering that Balenciaga is the property of the Gucci Group, one of three multinational luxury goods companies (Pinault Printemps Redoute and LVMH Mo&#235;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton are the others) that among them control an estimated 500 global brands, and that the Viktor &amp; Rolf label is backed by the French cosmetics giant L'Or&#233;al.What would fashion be, though, without contradictions? Take underfed models, a subject that just a month ago rated a full tabloid workup and that also inspired plenty of hand-wringing in the industry. What happened to the issue taken up so earnestly in New York at a news conference sponsored by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue in the Bryant Park tents? The fashion pack switched continents. The skinny model thing disappeared.Not a whisper was heard, over 10 days spent backstage in two cities -- first Milan and then the French capital -- about bulimia, anorexia or the fairly distressing (and by no means secret) reality that many models are thin not merely because they are 15-year-old gamines but because they smoke as heavily as road-workers and keep their metabolisms racing with the help of drugs like Adderall XR, the amphetamine-based stimulant prescribed for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.Those few models whose problems had seemed so obvious that their agents strategically pulled them out of the New York season were right back on the catwalks. If anyone felt concern for these poor stick figures, with their birdlike chests, their knobby knees and damaged expressions, the worry was hard to detect.Why be surprised? As with so much else in an appearance business, surface is everything and illusion shades easily into outright falsity. ''There's so much about fashion that's never real,'' the Missouri-born cult designer Jeremy Scott said on Tuesday, standing in a converted church in the Marais where he was still casting that evening's show.Called ''Happy Daze,'' the show was Mr. Scott's take on the malt-shop jukebox America of the '50s, a time that looks a lot more hopeful and lively to someone born in the '80s, as Mr. Scott was, than to anyone who happened to be alive at the time. It drew heavily on the thriving New Rave club scene that lately helped to put London back on the fashion map.Days ago in Milan, 60 motley personages from the London club Boom Box were flown in by the organizers of the Florence trade show Pitti Imagine, to inject some life into the drowsy local scene. And it worked.There was something completely tonic, in the context of a strong but clamped-down season, about the loony, unselfconscious spectacle of people like Kabir, a self-styled English fashion editor (of Drama, due in the spring) who wore a skirt as a cape and lam&#233; trousers and also a crooked cheap toupee; or an apparition called The-O, who had styled himself in a tulle party dress of uncertain vintage, patent leather heels, with his lips and eyes smeared red and his head covered in a outstandingly ratty wig purchased at a thrift shop for 80 cents.''The problem with these fashion people is that everybody's wearing things that cost thousands and you don't need to,'' explained The-O, who lives in an East London squat and claimed never to spend more than $2 for an article of clothing. ''You can look beautiful for just a few pounds. Add a bit of fake blood. That's always good.''If the revitalized London scene has yet to produce design stars with commercial prospects (Gareth Pugh, hailed as the most promising newcomer on the scene, actually canceled the orders he got when he showed his first collection, ''so as not to tarnish the label's potential by having it in too many retail outlets,'' as he explained to the French magazine Num&#233;ro), it has served to remind people that the center needs the margins in order to survive.Fashion is ''going to break in half,'' Mr. Scott predicted, unless a way can be found to reconcile the growing division between the global label machines and bands of independent creators looking to articulate personal visions through the medium of clothes. There is too much sameness, at the same time, too little connection between the fantasies being retailed by big fashion houses and the mixed-up, economically sensible way that most people really dress.''Too many people are making clothes that look realistic and plausible on the runway, that are never going to happen,'' Mr. Scott said. Why? They were never meant for production in the first place. ''So much of it is just a piece of boring something to promote an image, to sell underwear, handbags and perfume,'' said the designer, wrapping himself against the chill in a wool poncho whose pattern of eyeballs probably looks even more trippy to someone at one of the so-called New Raves.''I make fashion to provoke, to make you smile, whatever,'' said Mr. Scott, who is ranked No.31 on The Face magazine's list of the most influential people in fashion. ''It can't just be about consuming goods.''Fashion Diary</text></article><article id="1829600"><summary>B&amp;B Italia, contemporary furnishings company, is opening new store to public in SoHo; photos (S)</summary><text>B&amp;B Italia, the contemporary furnishings company, is joining the crush of design retailers in SoHo with a new store aimed entirely at the public.

Yet on several occasions in recent weeks, works of art have made me feel I was just too old to care about 20-somethings who needlessly complicate their lives and relationships. One of those works was Anna Ziegler's play ''BFF'' (that's ''best friends forever,'' for anyone too old to recognize the acronym), at the DR2 Theater.''BFF'' smacks of an after-school special. The action flips back and forth between vignettes of a friendship between two young girls, starting around age 11, and the life of one of the girls, Lauren (played by Sasha Eden, a founder of the theater company WET, which produced this show), 10 years later.When they're young, Lauren and Eliza (Laura Heisler) are best friends forever; Eliza's father has died; the girls are maturing at different speeds; Lauren throws Eliza over in a classic example of ''mean girl'' syndrome; Eliza falls apart. Years later Lauren, calling herself Eliza, starts to get involved with Seth (Jeremy Webb) but is oddly unable to commit: her past is haunting her.It is certainly possible to make fine art out of childhood experiences, but this play, developed in the Sundance Institute Theater Lab, just feels juvenile. It also strains credulity right from the first scene, when the two girls start musing on how the time will fly until they are grown up. This is the language of adult nostalgia, not of two girls hanging out on a dock in summer.The characters are set in motion more according to a psychology textbook than psychological credibility. Lots of symptoms are convincingly displayed, but it was hard for me to believe they would lead to the extreme breakdowns the play forces on them.The actors did their best, particularly Ms. Heisler, playing a quirky, confused kid not quite ready to grow up. All three did a good job of evoking childhood, even Mr. Webb, playing a character in his 20s with the puppylike mien of a much younger person. Young: I tend to apply that word to myself. But I was too old to appreciate this play.''BFF'' continues through March 24 at the DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 239-6200.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1829615"><summary>Room to Improve column suggests using light-emitting-diodes as energy efficient light bulb; photos (M)</summary><text>Q. Are compact fluorescent light bulbs the only energy-saving option?A. You might try light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, which give out more light per watt of electricity than compact fluorescent bulbs.Light-emitting diodes were invented in the '50s. They are semiconductor devices -- a kind of computer chip -- that give off light when current is applied to them. Depending on their chemical makeup, they can emit green, blue, red or white light.L.E.D.'s are now available with standard screw-type bases, so they can easily replace incandescent or compact fluorescent bulbs in your home. They are also sold in ''high-hat,'' or downlighting, fixtures for the ceiling. The face of most L.E.D. bulbs looks like a circuit board and the light they put out resembles a cluster of brilliant dots, each about the size of an aspirin tablet. An L.E.D.'s light is much whiter than that of a standard incandescent bulb, or even a compact fluorescent bulb, and L.E.D.'s work well on a dimmer or a timer. But like spotlights, they cast their light in one direction, so they don't work in table lamps.L.E.D.'s produce about 70 lumens (the standard measure for light) per watt, whereas an incandescent bulb produces only 10 to 15 and the compact fluorescent, only about 35. Unlike compact fluorescent bulbs, L.E.D.'s have no mercury, an important environmental consideration because most bulbs end up in landfills. L.E.D.'s cost more than either conventional or compact fluorescent bulbs, but they last far longer. Whereas the average incandescent bulb costs less than a dollar and a compact fluorescent bulb can sell for a few dollars, some L.E.D.'s run as high as $90 a bulb. But L.E.D. lights are typically rated as having a lifespan of 30,000 to 50,000 hours. So an L.E.D. bulb can last for more than 10 years, if you use it 8 hours a day. Compact fluorescents are typically rated at 7,500 to 10,000 hours, and incandescents at about 1,500 hours. Rather than burning out as incandescent bulbs do, L.E.D.'s light output dims over tens of thousands of hours. L.E.D.'s are also more resistant to vibration than incandescents or screw-in fluorescent bulbs, and do not flicker or hum.The city of Raleigh, N.C., recently announced that it will begin installing L.E.D.'s in some of its streetlights, and if they work well, will consider converting all 33,000 streetlights to L.E.D., according to Daniel Howe, an assistant city manager. Raleigh is using L.E.D. lights made by Cree Inc., of Durham, N.C., with components developed by the Lighting Sciences Group, of Dallas, which also makes bulbs for home use, shown above.Kim Freeman, a spokeswoman for General Electric, said the company makes L.E.D.'s, but only for commercial uses like outdoor signs, which are often in locations where changing a bulb is difficult. But given the high price of L.E.D.'s, she said, the company is focusing ''on the commercial side,'' rather than on making bulbs for home use, although that could change with progress in manufacturing. Smaller companies, though, are marketing them for use in the home, and L.E.D.'s are easy to buy on the Internet.Jeffrey Harris, a vice president at the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington, D.C.,-based advocacy group, said, ''L.E.D. lighting represents one of the most promising energy-efficient lighting solutions for the future,'' but costs have to come down before L.E.D.'s will be universally accepted for residential use.Exactly how much energy might be saved with widespread use of L.E.D.'s is not clear, but their long life makes them appealing for use in hard-to-reach places. They are gaining wide use as Christmas lights, and the Capitol Christmas tree was decorated with 10,000 of them last year.</text></article><article id="1829619"><summary>Personal Shopper column presents latest styles of shower heads; photos (M)</summary><text>SHOWER heads used to be fairly standard: a round fixture on the ceiling or wall of a shower that sprayed water on your head -- if you stood in the right place.

What I would give to have those mild white roots and those blue-green leaves to chop into creamy soup on a cold winter's day. But I'm doing something wrong. They will not grow for me.Every winter about this time I start the little black seeds indoors and nurse the threadlike seedlings until early spring, when I plant them in a raised bed enriched with compost. They seem to thrive at first, standing straight and tall, but somehow over the course of the summer -- be it weeds, a lack of water or my own evil eye -- my leeks turn to mush.Why? I called Scott Chaskey, the manager of Quail Hill, a community farm in Amagansett, N.Y., to find out his secret to growing them. He laughed.''I've literally gone over leeks with our chisel plow and they show up weeks later,'' Mr. Chaskey said. ''They pop right back up, sort of sideways, growing on an angle.''Same story from Leslie Rose Close, who gardens in Bridgehampton, N.Y. ''Leeks are invincible,'' she said. ''Too invincible. They're sort of a pest in my garden.''She planted them about 20 years ago. ''They just drop seed and I get new ones every year in the same patch,'' she said.Every four or five years she might transplant some seedlings to a new bed, because leeks are heavy feeders and they need rich soil to thrive. But she doesn't ever bother to blanch them, as the books advise, by pulling up soil around their stems as they grow.''I don't have the time or the discipline,'' she said. ''I just use them as they are. There's quite a bit of white below the surface.''The ones she doesn't eat just bloom. ''They're gorgeous,'' she said. All shades of purple, or creamy white. And then, of course, they set seed and make more leeks. In her garden, that is.All summer she grills them; in winter she digs them up, for soups.Is it the temperate climate, the sandy loam out on the East End? My garden in Maryland has swings of dry heat, heavy rain, smothering humidity. And this heavy clay could always use more compost.I sent an e-mail message to Wayne Winterrowd, at North Hill, the garden he shares with Joe Eck in southern Vermont.Heat couldn't be the problem, Mr. Winterrowd wrote back. After all, ''leeks were an important food crop in Egypt,'' he reasoned. ''So I am stumped.''He shared the secrets of his soil: plenty of decomposed chicken and pig litter, and a bit of 10-10-10 sprinkled lightly around the base of the young leeks once they are established in the ground.''We do not earth them up because we enjoy whole braised leeks and so don't want the problem of sand in their leaves,'' he wrote.(His recipe: Brown the leeks lightly in butter; simmer them in chicken stock until it is reduced to a syrup and the leeks are tender. Dust them with hard Italian cheese and set under the broiler.) I almost ran to Whole Foods, in the snow, to buy some, for $2.99 a pound.A lack of moisture, we both agreed, could be at the heart of my leek failure.Just like other members of the onion family, Mr. Winterrowd wrote, leeks ''will go into premature dormancy if they are allowed to dry out at the roots.''He suggested working some damp peat moss into the bottom of the row, to retain moisture. ''Or, better, plant them in about an inch or two of peat slurry, made from getting the moss very wet in a plastic bucket,'' he said.I don't like to use peat because, despite the peat industry's claims, I'm not so sure it's renewable. So I could substitute fibrous, half-digested compost, Mr. Winterrowd suggested, or decomposed sods -- those chunks of lawn one digs up on occasion -- or layers of newspaper. Well-rotted manure would help. Or, of course, I could finally set up that drip irrigation system I keep talking about.I've ordered seeds of Giant Musselburgh (veseys.com), a Scottish variety favored by Mr. Chaskey. ''It's thicker and squatter than the tall, long ones,'' he said. ''And the leaves are a deeper blue green.'' And I couldn't resist a French heirloom, Blue Solaise (cooksgarden.com), a hardy, large variety that overwinters in Vermont. Mr. Chaskey and his crew start seeds in Speedling trays, which are made of plastic foam. ''That sounds nonrenewable,'' he said. ''But these are 15 years old, and much better than black plastic.''The Speedling tray he likes has 200 cells. Each one is three inches deep, which gives those baby leeks plenty of root space. By planting two seeds per cell, his crew gets 400 leeks from each tray. And when it's time to plant them in the field, the seedlings are easy to separate, unlike ones grown in one big flat, which have to be ripped apart, injuring roots. (Speedling trays are available at groworganic.com.)Mr. Chaskey suggests using a dibble to make a three-inch hole for each seedling, then pressing the soil in firmly.''That's the key,'' Mr. Chaskey said. ''Onions, including leeks, like soil to be packed around them.'' Then he and his crew just hill them up as they grow.Other leek lovers, however, insist on keeping that hole open.''I dibble about a six-inch-deep hole and take the leek by the tip of its leaf and just drop it in,'' said Rob Johnston Jr., the founder and chairman of Johnny's Selected Seeds, in Winslow, Me. ''I just leave it there. I don't fill the soil in.'' (A fine dibble is available at johnnyseeds.com.)Since the plant might not be taller than the hole, you don't want to cover its growing tip. ''You could take a watering can or fine mist on a hose and sprinkle them nicely,'' he said.Nature will do the rest, filling in the holes gradually, as it rains and as those leeks grow. ''They won't miss a beat,'' he said.So, maybe I'll press the soil around some of them, and leave the other ones to Nature. But don't cover that growing tip.Mr. Johnston, who considers leeks ''one of my basic food groups,'' likes King Richard, a long variety with green leaves, which he deems tastier than the fashionable blue types.And here's how he stores them, to keep them as fresh as possible through the winter: He lifts them with a spading fork before the ground freezes and packs them in a five-gallon pail, with an inch of soil on the bottom.''Leave soil on the roots, and crowd the leeks into the pail, one by one, as close together as you can,'' Mr. Johnston said. Keep the pail in a cold cellar. ''Just above freezing is best.''There you have it: how to grow, store and eat the perfect leek. So, I'll try again. But apparently I'm not alone in my failure with a particular plant. Mr. Winterrowd confides that he cannot grow pak choi, although his climate is theoretically perfect for it, and Mr. Johnston tells me that ''some people can't grow peas.''But a gardener who really wants something never says never.IN THE GARDEN</text></article><article id="1829714"><summary>Garden Q &amp; A on growing hollies and caring for new growth on house plants; drawing (M)</summary><text>A Hedge of Green and RedQ. I want to plant a holly hedge in Connecticut (Zone 6). Blue Princess, with Blue Prince for pollination, seems to offer the most red berries and the shiniest leaves. Can you suggest a source for these two or recommend something better?A. For gardeners in Zones 5 and 6, there are no better evergreen hollies than the Meserve hybrids, most of which have ''blue'' in their names to honor their dark, shiny leaves.Blue Princess is royal for two reasons: its abundant dark red berries and its full pyramidal shape. Height can be as much as 15 feet, though 8 to 10 feet is more common. Blue Girl grows faster but has fewer berries, and is a less bushy plant.Blue Prince is the Princess's usual consort, similar in shape and size, with very dark, lustrous leaves. You might also consider the newer Mesan, a k a Blue Stallion. It grows slightly faster than Blue Prince, with no loss of shapeliness, and its leaves are a bit less spiny.And Mesan will pollinate Meschick, a k a Dragon Lady, as well as Blue Princess. The Lady is slightly less hardy than the Princess but taller, to 20 feet, and columnar, so it could make nice corners.No matter which of these hollies you choose, large plants from a local retailer will give you the strongest start. The wholesale grower Conard-Pyle, first to offer Kathleen Meserve's handiwork (back in the 1960s), has a dealer locator at conard-pyle.com. An alternative is Monrovia (dealer locator at monrovia.com).Buds Cannot Be Far BehindQ. I often see the houseplant care instruction ''Increase watering and fertilizing when new growth starts in spring.'' When is spring? Is new growth the tiny buds at the leaf bases, or actual stems and leaves?A. Sorry to be circular, but spring is when vigorous new growth starts, as early as February or late as May, depending on latitude and on the individual plant. And new means new. Buds can form in leaf axils and then stay put for many months. Resting plants may unfold a few leaves as they inch through the winter. Yet as you will soon see, the resumption of active growth is unmistakable.</text></article><article id="1829736"><summary>David Pogue column on midsize digital cameras from Sony, Olympus, Canon and Panasonic; cites special features for each; drawing; photos (L)</summary><text>Most people buy their digital cameras in one of two broad categories: compact (tiny, pretty, with snapshot-quality photos) or digital S.L.R. (black, bulky, with magazine-quality photos). Choosing between them is an agonizing task. You're far more likely to have the compact camera with you when a photo op pops up -- and yet in a battle of photo quality, as an Internet commentator once put it, an S.L.R. takes better pictures with its lens cap on.There is, however, a narrow category of in-between cameras -- too big for a shirt pocket, but still small enough for a coat pocket. At heart, these midsize models are still point-and-shoots, with features you generally don't get with S.L.R.'s, like a movie-capture mode, a ''live'' back-panel screen while you're framing a shot, and a price that's often under $350. And yet they offer some of what makes S.L.R.'s so great, like an eyepiece viewfinder, full manual controls and powerful telephoto lenses.The midsize Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8, Sony DSC-H5 and Canon PowerShot S3 IS, in fact, offer 12X zoom lenses, which blow away the feeble 3X zoom of most compacts. And the new Olympus SP-550UZ breaks records with an 18X lens. It's the most powerful zoom available on any camera, compact or even S.L.R.Why is a powerful zoom such a big deal? Because so many of life's great photographic moments happen at a distance: on a stage (school play, graduation ceremony, dance recital, wedding), a playing field (soccer, baseball) or some other kind of field (lion, elephant, buff-bellied pipit).Now, when you're zoomed in that far, it's very hard to get a steady shot without a tripod; your hand-held jitters are magnified, resulting in blurriness. That's why these cameras all have optical image stabilization, which makes their otherwise impractical lenses far more practical.Despite a price range from $307 (the Panasonic) to $500 (the Olympus), these cameras are amazingly alike. All are chunky little gadgets with large-diameter telescoping lenses. Each has a pop-up flash, which provides flattering light that minimizes redeye. On all but the Sony, the flash does not, however, pop up automatically; you have open it manually or by pushing a button.All of these cameras except the Panasonic use AA batteries. You use AA rechargeables most of the time -- and yet, if they die while you're on the road, you can always pop into a drugstore, pick up some new AAs (lithiums or even a gross of AA alkalines), and keep right on shooting.Midsize cameras also have room for another disappearing luxury: an eyepiece viewfinder, which comes in handy when the sun washes out the back-panel screen. These models, however, employ electronic viewfinders -- that is, a tiny TV screen inside the eyepiece, rather than a clear piece of glass. It shows exactly what you're about to shoot, but the image isn't as clear, nuanced or smooth as a see-through viewfinder.Finally, the photo quality from these cameras has more in common with compacts than with S.L.R.'s. Outdoors, or with copious light, all four take terrific clear shots with vivid colors. But indoors and after dinnertime, it's another story. You'll probably have to throw out a significant number of your indoor no-flash photos, which are often victims of horrible graininess or blur. Yes, blur; the stabilizer helps, but can't perform miracles.One reason is all four cameras contain a tiny sensor (0.4 inch diagonal). That's not much light-gathering area, especially when compared with the much larger sensors in S.L.R.'s (1.1 inches, for example).Another reason: These cameras crank up their own light sensitivity, known as ISO, automatically, in a further effort to reduce blur. Unfortunately, extremes in ISO mean extremes in ''noise'' (grainy speckles). Check out the sample photos at nytimes.com/technology.Not everything about these cameras is identical, however. Here's what makes each one special.CANON The PowerShot S3 IS ($338, 6.0 megapixels) may be the closest thing you'll find to a hybrid camcorder and camera. You can zoom or change focus while shooting video, a feature that's extremely rare in digital cameras; snap a photo while you're recording; capture superb stereo sound; and start recording while still in still-photo mode. The movies look fantastic, although a 2-gigabyte card holds only about 18 minutes of video.The S3's screen is tiny by today's standards: 2 inches. On the other hand, it swivels and rotates, like a camcorder's screen, so you can shoot over your head, down low, and so on.To make photographic matters even better, this camera can take 2.3 shots per second in burst mode, and macro shots as close as 0 inches away -- yes, you can photograph things actually touching the lens.OLYMPUS In addition to the first-ever 18X zoom lens, the ambitious SP-550UZ ($500, 7.1 megapixels) is loaded with unusual goodies. Its burst mode can capture incredible numbers of shots per second at lower resolutions -- 7 shots at 3 megapixels each, for example. Oddly, if you want full 7-megapixel shots, you get only a slowish one frame per second.There's a super-close-up mode for subjects only half an inch away; a 2.5-inch screen that brightens up in dim light to help you see what you're seeing; and a remarkable on-camera tutorial that teaches you by operating the relevant controls in real time, as you hold the camera.The zoom is astounding (28 to 504 mm, in film terms); you can practically peer up the nostrils of someone standing at the other end of the football field. But the stabilizer is effective only in the brightest light, when you're doing your best not to breathe or blink. The rest of the time, it's not quite up to ironing out the blur from fully zoomed-in shots.The menu design is another disappointment; it leaves you groping to find your way through that lengthy feature list. And then there's the price tag: $500. Discounts will surely kick in once the camera has settled in stores, but another $40 could buy you a proper digital S.L.R. (the Nikon D40, for example), complete with lens and phenomenal results.PANASONIC The Lumix DMC-FZ8 ($307, 7.2 megapixels) doesn't offer any special tricks like the Canon and the Olympus. But it's a consistent performer without any annoying design quirks. And no ''7 megapixels'' logo appears on the camera body; Panasonic gets points for breaking ranks with its rivals, who still want you to think that more megapixels means better photo quality.Standout features include an actual sliding on-off switch; a rock-bottom price tag; and the ability to save pictures in RAW format, a rarity among non-S.L.R.'s. (RAW-format photos use far more space on your memory card than traditional JPEG files. But professionals love RAW files because specialized software can virtually reshoot them with different settings -- after the fact. The Olympus offers RAW shooting, too.)SONY The first thing you notice on the DSC-H5 ($365, 7.2 megapixels) is its huge 3-inch screen, which makes the 2.5-inchers on the others (and the 2-incher on the Canon) look undernourished. Another bonus is the included set of rechargeable batteries, with charger -- a thoughtful touch.Otherwise, alas, there's not much to write home about on this year-old model. Most features work well, but the camera could use some caffeine; its early-2006 processor is slow, slow, slow. Burst mode is only one frame per second; during playback, pictures appear coarse and take about a second to sharpen up; the claustrophobic electronic viewfinder can be jittery in low light; and the recharge time for the flash can take an excruciating 8 seconds.If you're after a midsize superzoom, in other words, you can do much better. You could get the Panasonic for its low price and solid design; the Canon for its remarkable split camera/camcorder personality; or the Olympus for its mind-boggling zoom. You won't be slipping any of them into a pants pocket -- but when you bring home that prizewinning shot of the wedding kiss, the soccer goal or the buff-bellied pipit, all will be forgiven.STATE OF THE ART</text></article><article id="1829814"><summary>Article on Ridgway, Colo, as place to live or visit; photos; map (M)</summary><text>RIDGWAY, which sits hard up against the San Juans, the most rugged of Colorado's mountain ranges, used to be a place you just passed through on your way to the ski slopes of Telluride, a 45-minute drive away. Ridgway still serves as a portal to Colorado's southwest corner, but it has recently had a serious growth spurt, attracting young families priced out of Telluride as well as urban refugees and second-home buyers seduced by the gorgeous scenery, rural setting and smorgasbord of recreational options.''Ridgway was asleep, but she's awake now,'' said Barbara Morss, a 31-year resident of the region who is an owner of the White Horse Saloon, a local beer-and-pool joint, and is volunteer president of the town's chamber of commerce.Randy and Jennifer Charrette, in their mid-30s, moved to Ridgway in 2006 from the Boulder area after regularly visiting for eight years. They were in search of ''more of a small-town setting'' to raise their young son, Mr. Charrette said. The couple opened a bike shop, and immediately ''the community was behind it 100 percent,'' he said.The panorama of the serrated Sneffels Range to the southwest, dominated by 14,150-foot-high Mount Sneffels, and the Cimarron Range to the east rivals any in the state. ''I've been everywhere in Colorado, and it's the most beautiful place I've ever seen,'' said Howard Owen, of Austin, Tex., who bought a six-bedroom house on 10 acres in the Log Hill Village area three years ago.After selling a condo at Keystone ski resort in Colorado, Mr. Owen and his wife, Karen, chose Ridgway as a getaway and eventual retirement spot because of the relatively low elevation (just under 7,000 feet) and an attractive house price. ''But the views were what sent us over the edge,'' he said.The SceneEven as it shakes off its slumber, Ridgway, established in 1891 as the northern terminus of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad, retains an Old West flavor. Roads in the historic downtown -- where east-west streets bear the first names of the town founders and north-south streets the names of their wives and daughters -- are gravel, though paving is planned. Ranches, among them Ralph Lauren's 22,000-acre spread six miles from town, still occupy much of the county.Residents form an eclectic stew of ranchers, environmentalists and outdoors fanatics, a modern-day Western mix. Elite mountaineers call the town home in between expeditions to Nepal. Green-building advocates carry on the legacy of the late actor and environmentalist Dennis Weaver, who built his solar-powered Earthship house there in 1989 (it is on the market, for $3.3 million).Full-time residents and second-home owners alike talk of a close-knit and welcoming sense of community.''We have more friends here than we have in Florida, and we've been in Florida for 23 years,'' said Pam Baker, who spends summers in Ridgway while her husband, Steve, an orthopedic surgeon, shuttles back and forth from Port Charlotte. ''Our friends are ranchers, artists, teachers, cowboys.''Carol Dahlstein, of Pasadena, Calif., appreciates the casual ease of social interaction when she and her husband spend time at the century-old farmhouse they bought in 1991. ''I love it that people just drop by,'' she said.Ridgway, in other words, is not a place for misanthropes. Spend a few days in town -- browsing the well-stocked shelves at Cimarron Books and Coffeehouse, combing through the half-dozen antiques stores, indulging in a chocolate martini and homemade cheesecake at Drakes Restaurant -- and you're apt to encounter familiar faces.ProsRecreational opportunities, many of them in the nearby Uncompahgre National Forest, fan out in every direction. In winter, residents go cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. The nearby Ouray Ice Park lures ice climbers -- and spectators -- from around the country, while the San Juan Hut System draws hardy backcountry skiers. Downhill skiers and snowboarders head to Telluride or to Silverton, an hour south.Summer options include hiking or mountain biking on miles of Forest Service trails, climbing 14,000-foot peaks, four-wheeling along some of Colorado's hairiest roads, and boating and swimming in the reservoir at Ridgway State Park, just north of town.The occasional craving for culture can be satisfied by a quick trip to Telluride. The Bakers say they drive over to attend ballet, classical music concerts and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. But they relish retreating to Ridgway.''We're close enough to enjoy the amenities,'' Ms. Baker said, ''but we don't have to live in the tourist town.''ConsRidgway has a small grocery store, but the nearest large supermarket is in Montrose, 25 miles north. The closest movie theater is there, too. As for night life, an evening's highlight for many can be getting to bed early to rest up for the next day's outdoor adventure.Air access via the Montrose airport is generally good, though schedules are reduced in spring and fall, Mr. Owen noted.Overdevelopment is a fear in the area. Ridgway updated its master plan in 2000 to control growth and maintain it at 5 percent annually, said Greg Clifton, the town manager.The Real Estate MarketAlan Stapleton, managing broker at the Ridgway Real Estate Corporation, says that a dwindling supply of developable land in both the town and surrounding Ouray County has caused land prices to double in the last three years, and home values have appreciated 30 to 50 percent in that span.But compared with Telluride, where the median price of a single-family house in 2006 neared $2.3 million, according to Mike Shimkonis, an agent at Telluride Properties, a Ridgway bargain is not an oxymoron.Despite Ridgway's historic commercial buildings, many houses in town were built in the last 20 years, with several new subdivisions. ''It can be hard to find a nice home in town for under $350,000,'' said Shari Gardner, an agent with ReMax Cimarron.Vacation-home buyers gravitate toward areas with larger lots -- with or without houses on them -- several miles out of town, especially in Log Hill Village; the Divide Ranch and Club (formerly Fairway Pines), a 702-acre golf course development that recently changed hands; and Pleasant Valley. ''The baby boomers and retirees are ready for more elbow room,'' said Mr. Stapleton, ''but with a real strong community base.''House prices in these neighborhoods start in the mid-$400,000s but can surge to the high six figures and beyond. According to several local agents, while houses under $400,000 usually sell in two to six months, those listed at $1 million plus can easily stay on the market for a year to 18 months.As desirable homesites become harder to find and construction costs rise, buyers will increasingly seek out pre-existing and spec houses, Ms. Gardner believes.''It used to be people would come and didn't even want to look at houses,'' she said. ''They wanted to build their own homes.

The opportunity to play, dine and even view art outdoors appeals to families elsewhere cooped up by the cold. And its distinctly mild but rich style of Mexican food from the neighboring Sonora state across the border tempts tame young diners away from mac 'n' cheese.JetBlue's recent addition of flights from New York has improved travel connections to Tucson (Continental also flies from Newark to Tucson in winter). But once you arrive, a rental car is essential to getting around, particularly to the many parks that are scattered throughout the northern foothills or the neighboring desert, where saguaro cactuses resemble a vast welcome committee waving hello.CULTURECombining a zoo, a botanical garden and a natural history museum, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (2021 North Kinney Road, 520-883-1380; www.desertmuseum.org) covers the Sonoran environment in one outdoor campus. Natural habitats show off civilization-shy wild things, including mountain lions, Mexican wolves and ocelots that are native but rarely seen beyond the compound. Go early to catch them at their most active. A walk-in aviary shelters colorful desert birds that are easy to spot: stilts, cactus wrens, moorhens and hummingbirds. Knowledgeable docents are on the grounds with exhibits like snake skeletons and carpenter bee hives. Entrance is $12; $4 for children 6 to 12.The celluloid cowboys John Wayne, Burt Lancaster and Clint Eastwood all made westerns at the lots run by Old Tucson Studios (201 South Kinney Road, 520-883-0100; www.oldtucson.com), including ''Rio Bravo,'' ''Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' and ''The Outlaw Josey Wales,'' respectively. The faux frontier town conjures the lore of the Old West in movie sets and stage shows featuring quack doctors, dancing saloon gals, showdown stunts and lots of corny jokes ( ''This elixir cures yellow fever, scarlet fever, black fever, even that Saturday Night Fever''). Walking tours highlight the film history of the buildings, but children are happier riding the vintage train that loops around the studio lot. Down the road from the Desert Museum, the studios make an entertaining afternoon after an educational morning. Admission: $14.95; $9.45 for children 4 to 11.Pima Air and Space Museum (6000 East Valencia Road, 520-574-0462; www.pimaair.org) houses more than 275 historic aircraft, including President John F. Kennedy's Air Force One, which visitors can board. One-hour narrated tram tours provide drive-by sightings but can be too academic and confining for kids. Instead, run around the 80-acre grounds parked with MiG fighters, cargo carriers, helicopters and, in hangars, World War II planes. Near Tucson International Airport, this is a convenient pre- or post-flight sight. Admission is $13.50; $9 for children 7 to 12.OUTDOORS/RECREATIONGet up close to the many-armed saguaro cactuses that populate the desert with a visit to the cactus forests preserved at Saguaro National Park (3693 South Old Spanish Trail; www.nps.gov/sagu). The park is divided into two districts on either side of Tucson, the larger Saguaro East (520-733-5153) and Saguaro West (520-733-5158), where there are denser stands of cactus and which has the added advantage of being close to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Hikes led by rangers or naturalists at either visitor center tend to be short and family-friendly, covering the basics of desert natural history and ecology during the winter-spring season, including the life cycle of the saguaro. Scenic loop drives provide sightseeing opportunities for the car-seat crew with several turnoffs giving access to short hikes. At Saguaro West, climb Signal Hill to view petroglyphs of animals, spiral shapes and sunbursts etched onto a hilltop boulder pile by the prehistoric Hohokam people (a half-mile round-trip walk). A vehicle entrance fee of $10 is good for seven days at either district.Fifty-six miles out of town (90 minutes by car), Kitt Peak National Observatory (Route 386, 520-318-8726; www.noao.edu) on the Tohono O'odham Reservation offers astronomer-led stargazing sessions nightly (you must reserve ahead). After a box dinner included in the admission price and an orientation in which participants learn to use star charts, the group uses observatory binoculars to locate the constellations. In the grand finale of the three-hour program, visitors peer through Kitt Peak's dome-mounted telescopes to see planets, galaxies and star clusters. The observatory does not recommend the program for children under age 8, but has developed a program for younger children that is held monthly. The current nighttime program costs $39; $34 for students.If Kitt Peak is too challenging or time-consuming, check out the night sky at the Flandrau Science Center (1601 East University Boulevard, 520-621-7827; www.flandrau.org) on the campus of the University of Arizona. The outdoor Flandrau Observatory has free viewing through its 16-inch Cassegrain telescope on Wednesday through Saturday nights from 7 to 10.DOWNTIMEDrive up to Gates Pass Scenic Overlook in Tucson Mountain Park (take Speedway Boulevard west of the city, which becomes West Gates Pass Road) in time for sundown. Every evening, the roadside area draws gapers who scramble on top of rocks and boulders along park paths to catch the last glimpses of the sun as it sets over a largely rural valley to the west.Pack a picnic and ride the tram up the Sabino Canyon in foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains northeast of the city with Sabino Canyon Tours (5900 North Sabino Canyon Road, 520-749-2861; www.sabinocanyon.com). Part of the road is now closed to tram traffic because of recent flood damage, but visitors can walk along the road and its nine bridges that cross Sabino Creek. Admission is $5; $2 for children 3 to 12.On weekends, the blanched-yellow Old Pueblo Trolley (520-792-1802; www.oldpueblotrolley.org), a 1936 Belgian streetcar, rumbles through 10 of Tucson's most historic city blocks, ending at the gates of the University of Arizona. Children are invited to ring the car's bell. One-way fares are $1; 50 cents for children 6 to 12. On Sundays, the fares drop to 25 cents a person.WHERE TO EATCaf&#233; Poca Cosa (110 East Pennington Street, 520-622-6400; www.cafepocacosainc.com) excites the senses with colorful art and an authentic blackboard-based menu that changes twice daily. The chef, Suzana Davila, rotates 26 moles in her ever-changing repertory. Children clamor for her pastel de pollo, a baked dish of layered tortillas, salsa ranchera and cheese and meat (most entrees are $13 to $17).The Mexican neighborhoods of South Tucson have many simple and authentic restaurants. At Las Cazuelitas (2615 South Sixth Avenue, 520-792-0405; www.lascazuelitas.com) when the keyboardist (weekdays) or mariachi band (Fridays and Saturdays) takes a break, diners can hear the distinctive slap of tortillas being made by hand in the kitchen. Dishes like grilled steak ($12.95) are accompanied by creamy homemade refried beans and smoky salsa.The chef Janos Wilder runs Janos and its casual sibling, J Bar, which share the same building (3770 East Sunrise Drive, 520-615-6100; www.janos.com). Be the early bird at J Bar's happy hour (5 to 6:30 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays) to catch his signature J Dawg ($2.75), an upscale take on the Sonoran hot dog topped with smoked poblano crema, pickled cactus, whole-grain mustard and chorizo black beans. The regular menu is also a hit with jerked pork with cranberry habanero chutney ($15.50) and a dark chocolate jalape&#241;o ice cream sundae ($8.50).WHERE TO STAYThe first new Tucson resort in 18 years, opened in January 2005, the JW Marriott Starr Pass Resort &amp; Spa (3800 West Starr Pass Boulevard, 520-792-3500; www.jwmarriottstarrpass.com) is in the county-run Tucson Mountain Park, a cactus-filled desert reserve with hiking and biking trails. For families, the resort offers G.P.S.-guided ''geocaching'' treasure hunts in the desert, and the chef, Melissa Kelly, allows diners at her restaurant, Primo, to tour the gardens while the kitchen makes their meals, ideal for squirmers. Rooms start at $259 at this time of year.In the foothills, Loews Ventana Canyon Resort (7000 North Resort Drive, 520-299-2020; www.loewshotels.com) makes children welcome with unusual activities like back-of-the-house kitchen tours, stargazing outings and scavenger hunts. Two swimming pools and rentals of bikes, soccer balls and tennis racquets will provide action. Rates from $249 in season.To stay in true western style, corral the clan at White Stallion Guest Ranch (9251 West Twin Peaks Road, 520-297-0252; www.wsranch.com), a 3,000-acre ranch near the western branch of Saguaro National Park that appeals to children with a petting zoo, a heated pool and trail rides. Doubles run from $286 plus $108 for each extra person, with a four-night minimum stay, including meals and activities.WEEKEND WITH THE KIDS</text></article><article id="1829820"><summary>Stephen Holden reviews film Two Weeks, written and directed by Steve Stockman; Sally Field stars (M)</summary><text>In the deathbed drama ''Two Weeks,'' Sally Field creates an agonizing portrait of Anita Bergman, a middle-aged American everywoman in the final stages of ovarian cancer. As her four children and their families descend on the home in North Carolina that she shares with her second husband, Jim (James Murtaugh), the movie squarely confronts the physical realities of dying.Anita repeatedly vomits in bed. When her intestines become blocked, she chews her food and spits it out. Expected to die in three days, she lingers on for two harrowing weeks, drifting in and out of consciousness, moaning and hallucinating from the morphine, her mouth hanging open, as her children take turns standing watch. Even in the calm interludes when Anita is relatively pain free, dread and hard-bitten courage wage a fierce war on her stricken, haggard face.Ms. Field's tough, accurate performance is all the more compelling for its understatement. Not for a moment do you feel she is playing to the gallery. This character would never get up onstage and bleat, ''You like me, you really like me.''The movie gets many other details right: hospice care, the calls to funeral homes, the awkward distribution of possessions, the final farewells to family and friends and the long-seething sibling resentments that surface when major decisions have to be made quickly.The first film written and directed by Steve Stockman, ''Two Weeks'' is clearly inspired by personal experience. His remarks in the production notes state that his own mother died at home with the whole family present. In many ways ''Two Weeks'' is a knowing cinematic primer on what to expect when a parent dies. I should add, however, that it presents the best possible scenario of an extremely painful rite of passage. Final exits are often much messier than this well-ordered departure carried out with minimal tears and no permanent fractures of family solidarity.''Two Weeks'' gets into serious trouble in its clumsy attempts to offset the sadness and anxiety with humor. This pursuit of sitcom levity contaminates a movie that might have been an American answer to the hardheaded Romanian masterpiece ''The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,'' in which a man's life slips away inside a bureaucratic medical jungle.The biggest of many missteps is a visit from an assistant rabbi (the family is partly Jewish) who stands over Anita and bellows that she's looking great and soon she'll be better. A visit to the bank to close Anita's account using her forged signature is coyly depicted as a mock robbery, with the children wearing dark glasses and arriving in a ''getaway car.''A connective device -- clips from an interview videotaped by her oldest son, Keith (Ben Chaplin), at an earlier stage in her illness -- becomes an increasingly forced attempt to flesh out Anita's biography. At one point in his interrogation he asks her which of her children she has loved the most.Almost to the end of the film Keith, a Hollywood writer, recovering alcoholic and student of Zen, speaks in glib wisecracks that help him maintain a defensive distance from his deeper sense of helplessness.Barry (Tom Cavanagh), the middle son, is a go-getting executive who was the most responsible of the three brothers growing up, and Mr. Cavanagh gives him a chilly yuppie gloss. The spoiled baby of the family, Matthew (Glenn Howerton), is the sketchiest character, and his selfish, angry wife, Katrina (Clea Duvall), whom they all loathe, is the movie's designated baddie.The most endearing sibling is Anita's only daughter, Emily (Julianne Nicholson), who was 14 when Anita divorced her first husband and made the girl her confidante. Ms. Nicholson imbues Emily with a stubborn integrity. When she meets her brothers at the airport, she arrives armed with a library of how-to books about death and dying.Skulking through the house is Jim, who bitterly resents his stepchildren's taking over the home in which he has lived with Anita for 13 years. Because he is not their father (who, strangely, never appears or is heard from), they barely give him the time of day. Not nearly enough attention is paid to this friction. The portrait of grown children stampeding through the old homestead as though it belonged to them is the movie's most unsettling emotional undercurrent.''Two Weeks'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a couple of off-color remarks and stark images of illness.Two Weeks  Opens today in Manhattan.Written and directed by Steve Stockman; director of photography, Stephen Kazmierski; edited by Debra Chiate; music by Heitor Pereira; production designer, David Donley; produced by Mr. Stockman and John Marias; released by Custom Productions Inc. and Transcendent LLC.

Some of us may not find the subject so funny, but never mind. Somebody needed to revive the ''City Slickers'' formula, and this time the job has gone to Brad Copeland, who wrote the screenplay, and Walt Becker, who directed.Four buddies, fed up with the frustration and disappointment of their lives, set out on a road trip aboard their beloved motorcycles. Doug (Tim Allen), a dentist, worries that he has become so dull and uncool that he has lost the respect of his preadolescent son. Woody (John Travolta) is a hotshot deal maker who has lost his wife and his money. Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a plumber turned writer, is hopelessly henpecked, while Dudley (William H. Macy) is a hopeless nerd. (He is also at least the second character in a comedy released this year, after Diane Keaton's in ''Because I Said So,'' whose computer gets stuck on a noisy Internet porn site, a situation he is unable to remedy. This kind of thing must happen a lot to Hollywood screenwriters.)The main thing about these guys -- the main source of the movie's fumbling attempts at humor -- is that they're not gay. Really. Seriously. No way. They may worry about people thinking that they're gay, and they may do things that might make people think that they're gay -- dance, touch one another, take off their clothes, express emotion -- but they're absolutely 100 percent not gay. No no no no no no. No sir, I mean, no ma'am. That's what makes it funny, see.After camping out one night, for example, they have a conversation that's overheard by a highway patrolman (John C. McGinley) who decides, based on his misunderstanding of the perfectly innocent things they're saying, that they must be gay. But the thing is -- get this -- he's the one who's gay! You think he's a stereotypical homophobe, but he turns out to be a homophobic stereotype. It's magic!Anyway, the four nongay guys run afoul of some real bikers -- one of whom might be gay! -- and have to prove their manhood by standing up to the bullies. In the process, one of them gets it on with Marisa Tomei in the most nongay way imaginable within the limits of a PG-13 movie. The wives of the two who still have wives show up, proving, well, you know. And the fourth one? Could it be? Shut up!Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Allen, who have never aspired very far beyond their affable television-comedy personas, are easier to watch than Mr. Travolta or Mr. Macy, who both undertake what can only be called acting. This is more than the picture deserves, but then again, so is Ray Liotta, as the chieftain of the bad bikers, and so is Ms. Tomei.''Wild Hogs'' does deserve credit for a small but significant measure of originality. Its soundtrack is full of classic, open-road rock 'n' roll songs -- ''Highway to Hell,'' for example -- not one of which is ''Born to Be Wild.''''Wild Hogs'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has swearing, fighting and sexual innuendo. But don't get the wrong idea.Wild Hogs  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Walt Becker; written by Brad Copeland; director of photography, Robbie Greenberg; edited by Christopher Greenbury and Stuart Papp&#233;; music by Teddy Castellucci; production designer, Michael Corenblith; produced by Mike Tollin, Brian Robbins and Todd Lieberman; released by Touchstone Pictures. Running time: 100 minutes.WITH: Tim Allen (Doug Madsen), John Travolta (Woody Stevens), Martin Lawrence (Bobby Davis), William H. Macy (Dudley Frank), Ray Liotta (Jack), Marisa Tomei (Maggie), Kevin Durand (Red), M. C. Gainey (Murdock) and John C. McGinley (highway patrolman).FILM REVIEW</text></article><article id="1829822"><summary>A O Scott reviews film Black Snake Moan, written and directed by Craig Brewer; Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci star; photo (M)</summary><text>Like its predecessor, the Sundance hype-magnet ''Hustle &amp; Flow,'' Craig Brewer's new film, ''Black Snake Moan,'' comes cloaked in lurid, pulpy atmospherics. His characters -- pimps, prostitutes, nymphomaniacs -- seem to have crawled off the drugstore paperback racks of the 1950s or the grind house lobby posters of a slightly later era. His stories are slick with the grease of old-style exploitation, promising the sleazy, easy pleasures of lust, wrath and other deadly sins.Don't be fooled though. Underneath the surface of racial and sexual button pushing, behind the brandished guns and bared breasts, is a heart of pure, buttery cornpone. Like ''Hustle &amp; Flow,'' ''Black Snake Moan'' joins a dubious stereotype of black manhood to an uplifting, sentimental fable. In the earlier movie the hero was a soulful pimp with dreams of hip-hop glory.This time he is a retired blues singer with woman troubles and a vegetable farm. Really, though, the character, played with his usual fearsome wit by Samuel L. Jackson, is a tried-and-true Hollywood stock figure: the selfless, spiritually minded African-American who seems to have been put on the earth to help white people work out their self-esteem issues. No doubt ''Black Snake Moan'' is a provocative title, but a more accurate one might be ''Chaining Miss Daisy to the Radiator in Her Underwear.''About that chain. You may have seen it, clutched in Mr. Jackson's fists and looped around Christina Ricci's bare midriff, in advertisements for this movie. A white woman, a black man and a chain: it's hard to think of an image more likely to inflame the demons of the American id. But this is not a movie about sexual bondage or payback for slavery -- not exactly, anyway. It's overtly and insistently about recovery and healing, the slaying of personal demons by any means necessary.Mr. Jackson is Lazarus, whose wife, apparently bored by his upright ways, has run off with his brother. Ms. Ricci plays Rae, a troubled young woman well known around their small Tennessee town for her sexual availability. When her boyfriend, Ronnie (the increasingly credible Justin Timberlake), leaves for the Army, Rae falls into a bad old pattern. She suffers from ''spells'' of erotic craving that begin with twitching, coughing and fever and compel her to jump on anything with a Y chromosome and a pulse.One morning Lazarus finds her, badly beaten and barely clothed, at the side of the road near his house. He takes her home, washes her wounds and fetches her some medicine. (Only later will it occur to him to fetch her something to wear besides the white underpants and chopped-off T-shirt the camera prefers to see her in.) When she tries to jump on him, he grabs his Bible and flees into the yard, leaving the Good Book open to the verse (missing in my copy) about chains and radiators as instruments of righteousness.Whatever works. To their great credit, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Ricci understand that the relationship between Lazarus and his prisoner has its comic side, and some of their scenes together -- as when he takes her for a walk in his garden, using the chain as a leash, or when she is reeled in across the porch like an angry wide-mouthed bass -- play out like kinky screwball. Whether Mr. Brewer is in on the joke is less clear. In an early review in Film Comment that is at least as entertaining as ''Black Snake Moan'' itself, Nathan Lee has proclaimed Mr. Brewer a ''visionary.'' From where I sit, the vision looks pretty blurry, as the movie struggles to square its inherent absurdity with its earnest sense of conviction.Ms. Ricci, feral and saucer-eyed, throws herself into a role that is ultimately as threadbare as her T-shirt. Mr. Jackson, rarely bothered by characters that make no sense -- he was the star of both John Singleton's ''Shaft'' remake and ''Snakes on a Plane'' after all -- redeems Lazarus with his wily professionalism, much as Terrence Howard redeemed DJay in ''Hustle &amp; Flow.'' Mr. Jackson also benefits from the presence of capable character actors like S. Epatha Merkerson, as the pharmacist who is Lazarus's grown-up, fully dressed love interest, and John Cothran, as his friend the preacher.For all its willful, shaking-and-shouting intensity, ''Black Snake Moan'' never lives up to its soundtrack, which is as saturated with the blues as ''Hustle &amp; Flow'' was with the crunk sounds of Southern hip-hop. The songs from the Fat Possum Records catalog that play under much of the action, and two short archival clips of the great Son House explicating the place of sexual jealousy in his music, contain more pain, humor and wisdom than the entirety of Mr. Brewer's overloaded, overheated script. As a writer he combines a reasonably good ear for Southern idioms with a weakness for prosy exposition. In spite of Amelia Vincent's toothsome cinematography and the down-home locations, the movie often has the lumbering, literal-minded rhythms of a second-rate stage play -- not a moan or a howl, but a slow, anxious groan.''Black Snake Moan'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Half-naked nymphomaniac chained to radiator.Black Snake Moan  Opens today nationwide.Written and directed by Craig Brewer; director of photography, Amelia Vincent; edited by Billy Fox; music by Scott Bomar; production designer, Keith Brian Burns; produced by John Singleton and Stephanie Allain; released by Paramount Vantage.

Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, the film is at once sprawling and tightly constructed, opaque and meticulously detailed. It's part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is an unexpected repudiation of Mr. Fincher's most famous movie, the serial-killer fiction ''Seven,'' as well as a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts.Informed by history and steeped in pulp fiction, ''Zodiac'' stars a trio of beauties -- Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo -- all at the top of their performance game and captured in out-of-sight high-definition digital by the cinematographer Harris Savides. Mr. Gyllenhaal is the sneaky star of the show as the real-life cartoonist turned writer Robert Graysmith, though he doesn't emerge from the wings until fairly late, after the bodies and the investigations have cooled. A silky, seductive Mr. Downey plays Paul Avery, a showboating newspaper reporter who chased the killer in print, while Mr. Ruffalo struts his estimable stuff as Dave Toschi, the San Francisco police detective who taught Steve McQueen how to wear a gun in ''Bullitt'' and pursued Zodiac close to the ground.The relative unknown James Vanderbilt wrote the jigsaw-puzzle screenplay, working from Mr. Graysmith's exhaustive, exhausting true-crime accounts of the murders and their investigations, ''Zodiac'' and ''Zodiac Unmasked.'' Mr. Graysmith, coyly played by Mr. Gyllenhaal as something of an overgrown Hardy Boy, his great big eyes matched by his great big ambition, was a political cartoonist doodling Nixon noses at The San Francisco Chronicle when Zodiac started sending letters and ciphers to the paper, divulging intimate knowledge of the crimes. The first messages arrived in 1969, the year Zodiac shot one young couple and knifed another in separate Northern California counties before moving on to San Francisco, where he put a bullet in the head of a cabbie.The first cipher stumped an alphabet soup of law enforcement agencies, including the C.I.A. and F.B.I., but was cracked by a California schoolteacher and his wife. The decoded cipher opened with an ominous and crudely effective flourish: ''I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal.'' The letters, the misspellings and the lax punctuation kept coming, and perhaps so did the murders, though only five were substantively linked to him. A publicity hound, Zodiac claimed responsibility for murders he might not have committed, a habit that added to a boogeyman mystery and myth that chroniclers of his crimes, including Mr. Graysmith, have exploited.Mr. Fincher made his name with ''Seven,'' a thriller in which the grotesquely mutilated bodies of murder victims are nothing more than lovingly designed props. Although more than capable of adding to the exploitation annals, he is up to something profoundly different in this film, which opens with the shooting of two people parked on a lovers' lane at night, an attack that is soon followed by a squirmingly visceral knife assault on a couple during a daytime idyll. By front-loading the violence, Mr. Fincher instantly makes it clear just what kind of murderer this was -- one who liked to get his hands wet -- and ensures that the murders don't become the story's payoff, our reward for all the time stamps, geographic shifts, narrative complication and frustrated action.The story structure is as intricate as the storytelling is seamless, with multiple time-and-place interludes neatly slotted into two distinct sections. The first largely concerns the murders and the investigations; the second, far shorter one involves Graysmith's transformation of the murders and the investigations into a narrative. With its nicotine browns, the first section, which opens in 1969 and continues through the mid-'70s, looks as if it had been art-directed by a roomful of chain smokers. Dark and moody, like all of Mr. Fincher's work, this part has been drained of almost all bright colors, save for splashes of yellow, the color of safety and caution, and an alarming-looking blue elixir called an Aqua Velva that is Graysmith's bar drink of choice.The second, more vibrantly hued section begins with Graysmith sitting in the Chronicle newsroom, its yellow pillars now painted blue. He looks as bright and bushy-tailed as the day he read Zodiac's first letter, though now he comes equipped with three kids and a wife (an unfortunately familiar scold whom Chlo&#235; Sevigny imbues with some welcome wit). But there are demons still loose, inside and out, which is why Graysmith takes on Zodiac alone, warming up the stone-cold case. Domestic tranquillity, it seems, can't hold a candle to work, to the fanatical pursuit of meaning and self-discovery, to finding out what makes you and the world tick -- which is why, while ''Zodiac'' contains multitudes (genres, jokes, nods at 1970s New Hollywood), it feels like Mr. Fincher's most personal film to date.Maybe that's why it doesn't have the usual movie-made shrink-rapping and beard-stroking, as in Mommy was a castrating shrew and Daddy used a two-by-four as a paddle. Throughout the film Mr. Fincher and company keep focus on Zodiac's crimes, on the nuts and bolts of his deeds, rather than on the nurture and nature behind them. There is no normalizing psychology here, and no deep-dish symbolism either, maybe because the title crazy is so peculiarly fond of symbols, which he sprinkles in his missives and, for one murder, wears superhero style on a black-hooded costume that makes him look like a portly ninja in a Z-movie quickie. It's no wonder the victims don't see the threat behind the masquerade until it's too late.Psychology isn't Mr. Fincher's bag; he isn't interested in what lies and writhes beneath, but what is right there: the visible evidence. And what beautiful evidence it is. His polished technique can leave you slack-jawed, as can his scrupulous attention to detail: the peeling walls of a derelict building in ''Fight Club,'' the rows of ant-size letters marching across the pages of a composition notebook in ''Seven,'' the bruises splashed across a woman's arm in ''Zodiac.'' There is mystery in this minutiae, not just virtuosity, and maybe, to judge from reports of his painstaking process, a touch of madness. Like his detectives and journalists, Mr. Fincher seems possessed by the need to recreate reality -- to revisit the scene of the crime -- piece by piece.There's a moment early in the film when Mr. Downey stands in the Chronicle newsroom, back arched and rear gently hoisted, affecting a posture that calls to mind Gene Kelly done up as a Toulouse-Lautrec jockey in ''An American in Paris.'' Avery has already started his long slip-slide into boozy oblivion, abetted by toots of coke, but as he strides around the newsroom, motored by talent and self-regard, he is the guy everybody else wants to be or wants to have. Like Mr. Ruffalo's detective, who leaves everything bobbing in his rapid wake, Mr. Downey fills the screen with life that, by its very nature, is a rebuke to the death drive embodied by the Zodiac killer. Rarely has a film with so much blood on its hands seemed so insistently alive.''Zodiac'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains extremely graphic gun and knife violence, as well as alcohol abuse and cocaine use.Zodiac  Opens today nationwide.Directed by David Fincher; written by James Vanderbilt, based on the books ''Zodiac'' and ''Zodiac Unmasked'' by Robert Graysmith; director of photography, Harris Savides; edited by Angus Wall; music by David Shire; production designer, Donald Graham Burt; produced by Mr. Vanderbilt, Mike Medavoy, Arnold W.

Assignment: Scout out the top venues and D.J.'s in the city and be sure to hit them all before sunrise.Perhaps it makes sense, then, that one of the most anticipated clubbing events in the country -- the Winter Music Conference (www.wintermusicconference.com) in Miami -- is technically a get-together for professionals.Founded in 1985 as a convention for the dance-music industry, the conference has grown into such a rollicking good time for anyone who loves the music that the networking aspect is practically beside the point. This event functions less as a convention than as an Art Basel Miami for the audio set.''People in the dance-music industry used to actually conduct business, but in recent years it's mainly become a party destination,'' said Rob Fernandez, promoter for the Pacha nightclub in New York and for four club events at the Miami conference, including the parties Evolve and Subliminal Sessions. ''This week is like club-music heaven for the fans. It's the only time you can hear every major dance-music act in the world at the same time, and there's nothing else anywhere that rivals this week.''A six-day circus of more than 350 events -- hotel soirees, beach blowouts, concerts and, of course, nonstop club nights both official and fringe -- the conference is taking over spots in Miami and Miami Beach from March 20 to 25. Planners expect 40,000 people from more than 60 countries to attend.And while there will be plenty of D.J.'s, promoters, producers, label owners and distributors in the mix, there will be scads of straight-up dance-music lovers, too.''Whether someone is into drum 'n' bass, trance, techno, hip-hop, trip-hop, chill out or electro, they will find tons of events to attend,'' said Sabrina Winogrond, the conference's program director. ''People come back year after year for the parties, great music and the weather.''The first day's schedule alone has nearly a dozen events, including the official opening party, Afro Acid Miami, poolside at the conference headquarters, the Miami Beach Resort &amp; Spa. It will feature beats by the Chicago D.J.'s Pierre, Ron Carroll, Harrison Crump and Christy Love -- all well known on the house-music scene.Many of the parties rely on prominent D.J.'s to pull in the crowds; Carl Cox, Sasha &amp; Digweed, Jellybean Benitez and Victor Calderone will all make appearances, as will Danny Tenaglia, a major player in New York and Miami whose annual W.M.C. party at Twilo is among the most awaited of the week. Mr. Tenaglia will also spin as part of the ninth annual Ultra Music Festival, a two-day concert event at Miami's waterfront Bicentennial Park that is part of the conference. The Cure will be the headliner.BUT revelers will also have plenty of chances to hear the work of up-and-comers. ''Label owners, distributors, magazines and artist-management companies all throw events highlighting the talent or albums they are trying to break during the year,'' Ms. Winogrond said. ''The promoters try to make these parties as special and noteworthy as possible.''That's how, as Mr. Fernandez put it, ''Winter Music Conference week helps create stars.''In addition to parties, there will also be a D.J. spin-off, at which amateurs will compete head-to-head for an audience, and a record collectors' show, an opportunity to buy and sell that covers genres from blues and jazz to disco and hip-hop, which organizers expect will become an annual event.''Members of the W.M.C. staff would unwind by talking for hours about collectible music, and we'd share records with each other,'' Ms. Winogrond said. ''We realized we knew a huge number of collectors in South Florida who were equally obsessed with digging, so we decided to put the show together.''Another big part of the week is the 22nd annual International Dance Music Awards, which honors artists of the year with a ceremony, a cocktail party and an after party.And while even the industry people who attend the Winter Music Conference are usually not thinking about work (''There's so much partying, it's impossible to do any business,'' Mr. Fernandez said), opportunities for learning and networking do abound. Seminars and panels cover topics from retail and radio exposure to foreign markets and legal issues -- just in case you get tired of the fun.DETAILSADMISSION to most events at the Winter Music Conference (www.wintermusicconference.com) in Miami from March 20 to 25 costs up to $60, though some are free.

It aimed to make the product reviewed yesterday, a device the size of a pocket watch and known as the Chronicle implantable hemodynamic monitor, the first major implant approved solely for diagnostic monitoring.The Chronicle monitors blood pressure and other conditions inside the hearts of patients suffering heart failure, a disease that reduces the amount of blood the heart pumps. The goal is to warn patients, their doctors and other people who care for them when they are in danger at a point before they need to be hospitalized.Rising blood pressure can be caused by something as simple as eating too much salty food, which leads to water retention. If the rising pressure is caught in time, many patients can be stabilized at home with drugs or behavior changes.Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, estimated that as many as 400,000 of the nation's 5 million heart patients were sick enough to benefit from the implant. But the clinical trial, which enrolled just 274 patients, did not show a big enough reduction in hospital visits among Chronicle patients to be sure that it was helping.''There was agreement that this technology has a lot of promise,'' said Rob Clark, a spokesman for Medtronic. ''We're going to come back to the F.D.A. and explore other ways to bring this to market.''Skeptics have wondered how closely doctors would look at the flood of data if the product was approved, because health care providers are not reimbursed for such monitoring.The advice to deny approval of the device is not binding on the F.D.A. But the agency rarely overrides such recommendations, particularly when they come on a vote as strong as yesterday's 9-2 decision.Medtronic's shares declined 21 cents, to $50.15, in trading yesterday, which ended before the panel's vote was announced. The shares fell an additional 30 cents in after-hours trading.</text></article><article id="1829877"><summary>Defense Department confirms deaths of three service members in Iraq</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,153 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

Directed by Jay Corcoran  Not rated; 75 minutes''You always miss it: that world and that escape, that kind of sex,'' observes Peter Staley in Jay Corcoran's riveting, X-ray-acute documentary ''Rock Bottom.'' Mr. Staley, an articulate, gay, H.I.V.-positive recovering methamphetamine user, has gained notice in recent years for showering the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan with posters bluntly connecting the popularity of crystal meth with rising rates of H.I.V. infection.''Rock Bottom,'' filmed over two and a half years in digital video, is a ground-level examination of the crystal meth epidemic in gay New York. It follows seven men struggling with addiction, showing them high and sober. One dies of complications from drug use and diabetes. The difference in appearance between those under the drug's influence and the same men after a few months of sobriety is startling. Tweakers, as meth users are called, are cadaverous, pallid creatures with bad skin and phosphorescent eyes who chatter as if possessed; sober, the same men appear calm, healthy and optimistic.Although experts are consulted, ''Rock Bottom'' is not a finger-wagging jeremiad. A graphic study of sex and drug addiction, it goes way beyond the pieties of the recovery and therapy movements to confront deeper questions about the pursuit of sensation.The bravado that a jolt of speed gives to men with shaky self-esteem in a still homophobic culture is an element of its appeal. But as men describe the intensified and prolonged pleasure of sex with meth, you realize that it belongs to the same category of sensation-seeking as race-car driving, skydiving and gambling.A craving for delirious excitement may be hard-wired into the male psyche, and danger is a crucial component of whatever gratifies it. In a certain segment of gay society, sex is the competitive sport of choice. As with steroids in the athletic arena, for some players, gaining an edge is worth any risk, even if it kills you.STEPHEN HOLDEN</text></article><article id="1829919"><summary>Jeannette Catsoulis reviews Linda Hattendorf documentary film The Cats of Mirikitani (M)</summary><text>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Linda Hattendorf  In English and Japanese, with English subtitles  Not rated; 74 minutesThe title may suggest a wildlife documentary, but ''The Cats of Mirikitani'' is entirely, vibrantly human. When, early in 2001, the New York filmmaker Linda Hattendorf befriends the homeless artist who works beneath the awning of a grocery store near her SoHo apartment, she has no way of knowing where the friendship will lead -- nor how their shared experience of one national tragedy will sharpen the legacy of another more than half a century earlier.Born in Sacramento in 1920, raised in Hiroshima and interned in an American camp after he returned to the United States to avoid Japanese military service, Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani relives his painful past with vivid paintings of internment huts, blood-red skylines and the wide-eyed cats that comforted a child who died while interned. When Jimmy's health is threatened by the dust clouds of Sept. 11, Ms. Hattendorf moves him into her home, and what began as an interesting portrait of an outsider artist becomes a fascinating story of injustice and endurance.Parking her camera on the floor of her cramped apartment, Ms. Hattendorf tries to connect this proud octogenarian visitor with long-lost relatives and strained social services. The result is a movie that evolves naturally from the filmmaker's compassion for her subject; as much as possible, she remains off camera, and her immense act of charity is never permitted to become the film's focus. Instead this remarkable documentary offers a brief but satisfying look at a defiantly self-sufficient life.JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</text></article><article id="1829926"><summary>No abstract is available for this article.</summary><text>It started in 2001 with two old friends meeting at the Oyster Bar in the basement of Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, discussing a $25,000 debt.It ended yesterday with federal authorities saying that they had exposed one of the most far-reaching insider trading schemes on Wall Street in decades, involving four investment banks and a web of hedge funds, day traders, lawyers and even a few supervisors, who upon discovering evidence of insider trading, blackmailed the traders to keep quiet about it.Thirteen people were accused yesterday of taking part in the trading ring, including a former Morgan Stanley compliance official, a senior UBS research executive, three employees from Bear Stearns and a Bank of America employee.Linda C. Thomsen, chief of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, described the scheme as one of the most ''pervasive Wall Street insider trading rings since the days of Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine.''Nine of the defendants have been arrested, and four have pleaded guilty to charges ranging from securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and bribery. The investigation, conducted by the S.E.C., the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan, has been under way for more than a year and is continuing.The schemes described by federal authorities were unusual for their breadth and the seniority of the executives involved.The tactics, however, were all too familiar: Wall Street executives tipping hedge fund traders about potential upgrades or downgrades of stocks, information sure to move a stock's price; leaking information about pending mergers and acquisitions, and taking kickbacks to get access to hot deals. In the middle, authorities say, was a hedge fund manager looking for an edge.Federal authorities say that in 2001, Mitchel S. Guttenberg, a 41-year-old executive director in the stock research department of UBS, met a friend, Erik R. Franklin, then a hedge fund manager at Bear Stearns at the Oyster Bar. Mr. Guttenberg owed Mr. Franklin $25,000 and proposed paying that debt with information about stock upgrades and downgrades. He was a member of the firm's investment review committee, which reviewed and approved analyst recommendations.Mr. Guttenberg provided hundreds of tips to Mr. Franklin about rating changes so that he could make quick trades in his hedge fund at Bear Stearns, Lyford Cay Capital. The two agreed to share the after-tax profits after the debt between them was settled. They exchanged cash at arranged meeting places -- echoes of the Boesky case -- and bought disposable cellphones and created codes to communicate with one another.Lyford Cay was a small hedge fund overseen by Kurt W. Butenhoff, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns who is a top-producing broker and an equity derivatives specialist. Lyford Cay was made available to the firm's high-net-worth clients, a number of whom resided in the exclusive resort of the same name in the Bahamas, as well as senior Bear Stearns executives. The fund was closed down in 2004 because of poor performance.Mr. Franklin reported to Mr. Butenhoff. In 2002, Mr. Franklin left Lyford Cay to return to Chelsey Capital, a hedge fund whose president once sought to buy the New Jersey Nets. Mr. Franklin joined forces with another portfolio manager, informed him about the UBS tips and the two traded on them, investigators say.A spokesman for DSJ International, which operates as Chelsey Capital, said: ''We are dismayed to learn of the actions of two former employees who left over four years ago. We are committed to continue cooperating in the investigation.''Mr. Guttenberg pleaded not guilty yesterday. His lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Franklin has pleaded guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.Over five years, according to the S.E.C., Mr. Franklin made $5 million in illicit profits for his various hedge funds, his own personal accounts and an account in the name of his father-in-law, said the S.E.C.But the ties went further than the two friends: each had his own network of tippees. The case was so complex that the United States attorney in Manhattan, Michael J. Garcia, yesterday used a large poster board to explain the inner workings. ''Clearly greed is at work,'' he said.According to court filings, some of Mr. Franklin's former Bear Stearns colleagues, including Robert Babcock, also worked with Lyford Cay and knew he was receiving, and profiting from, illegal information. After Mr. Franklin left Lyford Cay at Bear Stearns, Mr. Babcock continued to monitor Mr. Franklin's personal accounts and used the information to trade for Lyford, making $660,000 between late 2001 to 2003. Another Bear Stearns employee was accused of using information gleaned from Mr. Franklin's account to trade for his own accounts.Mr. Babcock has pleaded guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.''Actions described in the complaint are clear violations of our policies and procedures,'' said Russell Sherman, a Bear Stearns spokesman. ''We have and will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation.''Mr. Guttenberg gave tips to other friends, including David Tavdy, a 38-year-old proprietary trader at Andover Brokerage, which was later acquired by Assent. Mr. Tavdy traded on information at Assent and then later at Jasper Capital. Mr. Tavdy ultimately made $6 million trading in illicit information, according to the S.E.C.Mr. Tavdy pleaded not guilty. His lawyer did not return calls.Two executives at Assent got wind of the illegal UBS information and the trading that was going on with it. Rather than turn the traders in, they demanded bribes of $150,000 between them to keep quiet, investigators say. The two executives face charges.A UBS spokeswoman, Rohini Pragasam, said, ''UBS is assisting the authorities to the fullest extent possible in their investigation into the alleged actions of a single UBS employee.''It was not the UBS scheme, however, that tipped off regulators but rather trading around big mergers that got the S.E.C.'s attention.According to authorities, in 2004, Randi Collotta, a 30-year-old lawyer in the global compliance department at Morgan Stanley, teamed up with her husband, Christopher Collotta, to dispense information about Morgan Stanley's work on coming mergers to Marc Jurman, a high school friend of Mr. Collotta's. In return, authorities said they would receive a share of illegal profits.Mr. Jurman traded on deals including Adobe Systems acquisition of Macromedia in 2005 and ProLogis's acquisition of Catellus Development. The information netted them about $600,000.Mr. Jurman in turn tipped off Mr. Babcock, who passed on information to Mr. Franklin and his partners at Bear Stearns, closing a wide, and very lucrative, circle.Unusual trading in Catellus tipped off the S.E.C. The trading led to an account in the name of Mr. Franklin's father-in-law. Over a year of investigation, the myriad connections became clear.Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman said, ''We are outraged that a former employee allegedly stole confidential information from the firm, and we have cooperated and will continue cooperating fully with the authorities.''Mr. Garcia described Morgan Stanley and UBS as victims.Mr. Jurman pleaded guilty. His lawyer, Lilly Ann Sanchez, said: ''We aimed to resolve this case expeditiously. Mr. Jurman is a very minor player in the overall conspiracy.''The Collottas entered not guilty pleas yesterday.Mr. Franklin had yet another scheme going to get inside information: between late 2005 and October 2006, Paul Risoli, a broker at Banc of America Securities, is accused of allocating shares of initial public offerings and secondary offerings to Q Capital, Mr. Franklin's hedge fund, netting the fund at least $160,000. Mr. Franklin is accused of paying Mr. Risoli $9,500 as part of the scheme.Mr. Risoli pleaded not guilty. His lawyer could not be reached yesterday.''We are aware of the situation and we are cooperating with authorities,'' said Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Bank of America.For two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and four counts of securities fraud, Mr. Franklin would face a maximum of 90 years in prison, but sentencing guidelines suggest he would more likely face about five years.The S.E.C. complaint accused 11 people and 3 entities of making illicit profits totaling more than $15 million, while the criminal charges cite illicit profits of $8 million from 13 individuals.</text></article><article id="1829963"><summary>Martha Ledger letter on February 23 article on visit to cenotes, or underground sinkholes, in Yucatan, Mex</summary><text>To the Editor: Re ''Deep Inside the Yucat&#225;n'' (Feb. 23): I just returned from a two-week vacation in the Yucat&#225;n and was delighted to see your article on the area's cenotes.

He had eliminated all the abstractions of last season, like aprons, and focused on clothes that were contemporary, yet classic enough to satisfy a purist. All the way down the escalators of the Pompidou Center, the site of the show, and into the street, you could hear editors saying, ''At last, something to wear!''Yet in comparing the collections of Saint Laurent and Givenchy, by Riccardo Tisci, one finds a crucial difference. Both Mr. Pilati and Mr. Tisci offer very wearable clothes. Mr. Pilati's raglan-sleeve coats, in nubby textures, have a slight masculine air about them. Indeed, the lanky volumes recall his men's show in January.There are also variations on the tunic (in mink shaved to resemble crocodile skin), jackets that gave the illusion of layers, and simply-cut dresses in gray wool or silk Jacquard with short, blousy sleeves and a tie streaming seductively down the back. For evening, the message was the tuxedo -- now as a mini coatdress in couture silk.It all looked smart and wearable. Yet the collection wasn't driven by a feeling of creative belief. Think, for instance, of the intense colors at Dior and the bombardment of looks. You may not like that kind of fashion, but you can't deny the energy and optimism behind it.Mr. Pilati, in wanting to be more clear and focused with Saint Laurent, seemed to swing too far in one direction, and maybe that is a reflection of his personality. He is capable of giving a sense of surprise and eroticism -- and Saint Laurent is that kind of house. Having more color in the collection would have helped, but the problem ran deeper than a jolt of pink. Maybe it's a question of striking a better balance.Although Mr. Tisci took a serious step this season to make Givenchy more coherent, he did not lose any imaginative strength. He followed the sailor theme of his January couture show, with snug jackets sharpened by an extreme detail (like white shirts with a long sailor tie) and some of the best trousers in the business.As tailored as the collection looked, there was invariably an overscale gesture -- a navy sweater done in the shape of knotted rope, a cropped vest with a thick edge of glossy black fur, a pleated silk dress in conch-shell pink with a dramatic swag. The collection displayed plenty of restraint, but Mr. Tisci never stopped putting his creativity out there. And that's what his customers expect from him.Under make-believe clouds suspended from the glass dome of the Grand Palais, the Chanel show today was enchanting. Karl Lagerfeld had his models circle an imitation frozen pond. The silhouette was longer, more playful than in the last couple of seasons, though boucl&#233; check ski pants, matching boots and checked taffeta down vests and jackets could rapidly add up to Sun Valley Schmaltz.Still, long wool coats in purple and turquoise with deep vents looked luminous and cool with over-the-knee boots. Many of the looks were belted just above the waist, and shown with plastic collars and metal headbands dangling with pearls. And as always with Mr. Lagerfeld, there were those reassuring moments of brutal fashion: a knitted vest in an abstract black-and-white pattern with an edge of turquoise, worn with a sheer black blouse and a matte gold sequined skirt.There have been some statements about archetypal shape at the shows, notably Martin Margiela's superwide shoulders. A metal brace helped convey the arbitrariness of an imposed shape, but it wasn't a point really worth repeating.At Comme des Gar&#231;ons, Rei Kawakubo's stretch jersey dresses with padded squares and female hands were thoroughly imaginative. The pinks and lilacs were childishly sweet, along with the mouse and rabbit ears worn by the models. And some Jessica Rabbit dresses were appliqu&#233;d in the front with ruffled child-size versions. But it was Ms. Kawakubo's almost erotic use of padding (imagine tennis-ball-size mounds and doughnut-shape rings) that suggested the feeling of being pinched by a stranger.FASHION REVIEW</text></article><article id="1830043"><summary>Myer Feldman, aide to Pres John F</summary><text>Myer Feldman, an aide to President John F. Kennedy who remained virtually unknown to the public while playing an integral role in planning his presidential campaign, White House press conferences and governmental policies, died Thursday in Bethesda, Md. He was 92.His son, James, announced the death. Mr. Feldman lived in Potomac, Md., and Miami.Mr. Feldman's importance was suggested in The New York Times Magazine in an article in 1962 about the prestige of having a low license-plate number in the District of Columbia. His number, 116, was the lowest of any White House official's.But an article in The New York Post in 1964 called Mr. Feldman ''the White House's anonymous man.''Mr. Feldman, a lawyer known as Mike, led a group assigned to find negative information about Kennedy's Republican opponent in the 1960 presidential race, Richard M. Nixon.They compiled a mountain of potential embarrassments nicknamed the Nixopedia, Theodore C. Sorensen, a Kennedy adviser, wrote in his book, ''Kennedy,'' in 1965. Mr. Sorensen was Mr. Feldman's direct superior at the White House, where Mr. Feldman held the title deputy special counsel.When Kennedy was preparing to counter critics of his Roman Catholicism in a crucial campaign speech in Houston, Mr. Feldman found Irish-sounding names of Texans who had died at the Alamo for Kennedy to use in the speech. More importantly, he helped prepare Kennedy for the televised debate with Nixon.Mr. Feldman was among a group who had breakfast with the president before news conferences. He was a behind-the-scenes liaison to Israel, a principal adviser on domestic policy and the channel for business requests, like tariffs and air routes.''If Mike ever turned dishonest, we could all go to jail,'' Kennedy said, according to Mr. Sorensen.Mr. Feldman stayed on in the White House after Kennedy's death to serve President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson promoted him to special counsel.In Johnson's 1964 presidential race, Mr. Feldman reprised his dirty-tricks role by leading a secret campaign to demean Senator Barry M. Goldwater, Johnson's opponent. Among other tactics, they fed hostile questions to reporters who were following Mr. Goldwater, Robert Dallek wrote in ''Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times 1961-1973.''Myer Feldman was born on June 22, 1914, in Philadelphia. His father, a tailor, died in 1918 in the great influenza epidemic. He attended Girard College in Philadelphia, which was founded as a boarding school for fatherless boys ; he graduated at 16.He worked for a roofing company, then won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to that university's law school, where he was on the law review.He taught at the law school until joining the Army Air Forces in 1942. After the war, he worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission, rising to executive assistant to the chairman. He went on to work for the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, where he met Mr. Sorensen, who was then an aide to Kennedy, who was then a senator.Through Mr. Sorensen, he became a legislative assistant to Kennedy, who gleefully assigned the city boy to agricultural issues.''Mike, how are the crops?'' Kennedy would ask, The Post reported.Mr. Feldman was sent to meet quietly with Israeli leaders, particularly David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir, about matters including arms sales, Palestinian refugees, and whether Israel was building a nuclear weapon.He remained a trusted liaison to the Kennedy family.In 1972, just after Senator George McGovern won the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. McGovern's advisers wanted Senator Edward M. Kennedy to be his running mate, Time magazine reported.Mr. Feldman was dispatched to the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, Mass.''Ted's not going to do it,'' he reported back.(Thomas F. Eagleton was chosen instead, but dropped out after disclosures of his psychiatric treatment. R. Sargent Shriver, a close friend of Mr. Feldman and the brother-in-law of Senator Kennedy, was then selected.)After Mr. Feldman left government service in 1965, he started a Washington law firm that grew to 100 attorneys; made many millions buying and selling radio stations; and helped finance the condominium boom in Washington in the 1970s.He participated in many more political campaigns, usually in the background, and his charitable work included being chairman of the executive committee of the Special Olympics.Mr. Feldman was a book review editor for the Saturday Review of Literature and helped produce six plays. In the Kennedy White House, where wit and intellect sometimes seemed a competitive sport, Mr. Feldman and Mr. Sorensen traded memos in rhyming couplets.Mr. Feldman and his first wife, Jackie Moskovitz, divorced in 1979. In addition to his son, James, of Washington, he is survived by his wife, Adrienne Arsht; his sister, Ethel Mufson, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Jane Feldman of Hermosa Beach, Calif.; and two grandchildren.</text></article><article id="1830048"><summary>Photo shows Ramzan Kadyrov with folk dancer celebrating his designation as Chechnya's president</summary><text /></article><article id="1830051"><summary>Iran and Venezuela begin weekly flight between Caracas and Tehran; flight includes stop in Damascus, Syria (M)</summary><text>Iran is already Venezuela's closest ally outside Latin America, with ventures to produce oil and build cars and tractors together. Now, travelers between the countries can also take a weekly flight between Caracas and Tehran.The flight, which was inaugurated here on Friday and includes a stop in Damascus, Syria, is operated in a code-share agreement by the Venezuelan state-controlled airline Conviasa and Iran's national carrier, Iran Air.Officials at Conviasa said that the company would use a Boeing 747 on the route and that soon it would also make available a European-made Airbus 340.Under President Hugo Ch&#225;vez, Venezuela has tightened relations with Iran and expressed explicit support for its uranium enrichment program.Mr. Ch&#225;vez has also reached out to Syria, making plans to build a $1.5 billion oil refining complex there. He sees relations with Iran and Syria, both under United States sanctions, as a centerpiece of a foreign policy aimed at countering American influence around the world.Mr. Ch&#225;vez ''is much loved in our country, and our people want to come here to get to know this land,'' Abdullah Zifan, Iran's ambassador to Venezuela, said when plans for the flight were announced last month.Venezuela is considering extending its economic cooperation agreements to the military sphere. It is discussing a venture with Iran to produce remotely piloted aircraft that could be used for surveillance along the border with Colombia.Iranian officials are already a staple of state television shows here, invited to discuss the country's array of agreements in Venezuela, including one to produce Peugeot-inspired Semand sedans at a plant that is expected to start commercial output near Caracas this month.For Conviasa, the Tehran route will raise its international profile. The airline said in a statement that it would ''offer excellent service at solidarity prices,'' although no one at Conviasa could immediately say what a ticket to Tehran would cost.</text></article><article id="1830066"><summary>U.P.S. Cancels Plane Order</summary><text>United Parcel Service, the last remaining customer for the cargo version of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, said on Friday that it was walking away from its order for 10 planes, citing concerns that Airbus would not be able to meet a revised delivery schedule.The cancellation by U.P.S., four months after its main competitor, FedEx, also abandoned an order for 10 planes, leaves Airbus without a customer for the A380 freighter. It is another blow to the company, which announced this week the details of a cost-cutting plan that is expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs across Europe over the next four years.''This is another slap in the face for Airbus,'' said Doug McVitie, a consultant at Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France. ''U.P.S. will probably turn to Boeing now for good.''The move follows a confirmation by Airbus late Monday that it had halted work on the A380 freighter to concentrate on the passenger version of the plane, now two years behind schedule.''This is a decision; it's final,'' said Mark Giuffre, a spokesman for U.P.S. in Louisville, Ky.U.P.S. said its decision would be formally presented to Airbus at the first opportunity allowed under the terms of an agreement reached last week that gave either party the right to cancel the order. The date has not been disclosed, but John Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer for customers, said last week that the date fell in the second half of this year.The announcement appeared to catch Airbus by surprise. In an e-mail exchange hours before the announcement, Mr. Leahy indicated that he had not been expecting a decision by U.P.S. for some time.''The order remains on our books until U.P.S. makes a final decision,'' Mr. Leahy wrote. ''As they said  Later this year.''U.P.S., the largest package delivery company in the world, had originally expected its order -- valued at $2.8 billion -- to be delivered beginning in 2010. The company disclosed Friday that the latest agreement with Airbus had delayed those deliveries by two years.''Based on our previous discussions, we had felt that 2012 was a reasonable estimate of when Airbus could supply this plane,'' said David Abney, chief operating officer of U.P.S. and president of U.P.S. Airline. But after Airbus decided to divert workers to the passenger version, ''we no longer are confident that Airbus can adhere to that schedule,'' he said.Barbara Kracht, an Airbus spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the company would seek to persuade U.P.S. to change its mind.''We respect the customer's decision,'' she said. ''U.P.S. is and remains a reliable business partner for Airbus.''Last month, U.P.S. announced a $3.8 billion order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters. Those planes are scheduled to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. U.P.S. said at the time that the Boeing order was not related to its review of its A380 order.For Airbus, there may still be a silver lining in the U.P.S. decision. The company has repeatedly said in recent months that the lack of a large order book for the A380 freighter made it possible for the company to focus its energy on delivering the 166 passenger versions of the plane to airlines as quickly as possible. With U.P.S. now abandoning its 10 production slots, Airbus should be able to offer them to other major airline customers, like Emirates or Qantas, which are eagerly awaiting their planes.Virgin in Talks for New Planes  By Bloomberg NewsVirgin Atlantic Airways, the airline controlled by the billionaire investor Richard Branson, is in talks with the Boeing and Airbus on new planes to make up for delays in the delivery of six Airbus superjumbo jets.It's ''possible'' that Virgin will order other planes to fill capacity needs until the A380s arrive, Mr. Branson said. The airline, based in London, expects to make a decision in the next three or four weeks.Virgin's order for six of Airbus superjumbo A380s was delayed in October after construction disruptions at the plane maker. The 555-seat aircraft will now be delivered in three years, Mr. Branson said yesterday.</text></article><article id="1830068"><summary>Again, Boeing Is Scrutinized on a C</summary><text>When the Boeing Company won a $15 billion contract last November to provide the Air Force with the next generation of search-and-rescue helicopters, Boeing officials were not the only ones surprised.So were executives at the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Sikorsky Aircraft unit of the United Technologies Corporation, which were both promoting models that were newer, lighter and more nimble than Boeing's 54,000-pound variation of its Vietnam-era Chinook.After all, Lockheed's team was considered the front-runner after winning the prestigious contract to build the next presidential helicopter fleet. And Sikorsky is the incumbent, with its Pave Hawk helicopter.Rather than just lick their wounds, Lockheed and Sikorsky quickly lodged protests with the Government Accountability Office, Congress's auditing arm. It was a long-shot effort -- less than 30 percent of such protests prevail. But with so much on the line, the companies were livid.Lockheed even accused the Air Force of using a double set of books. ''The competitors received different instruction during the competition,'' Greg Caires, a Lockheed spokesman, said in a statement last November.In a rare decision that could overturn Boeing's victory, the G.A.O. said on Monday that the Air Force should reopen the competition, and, if Boeing's bid ''no longer represents the best value to the government,'' the Air Force should ''terminate the contract.''The G.A.O. said the Air Force had violated its own cost-analysis rules when it picked Boeing, and even said that Lockheed and Sikorsky should be reimbursed for their legal expenses in lodging the complaint.''We promised to take a look at a number of things, and ultimately the cost evaluation pulled up short,'' said Michael R. Golden, a procurement lawyer in the G.A.O.'s general counsel's office. ''It's a large-dollar program. It's a major weapon system, and it's a lot of helicopters.''It is also a stunning reversal of fortune for Boeing, as well as an embarrassment for both the Air Force and the company.For years, the Air Force and Boeing have been accused of having a cozy relationship -- so cozy that the two became enmeshed in a conflict-of-interest scandal that ended last year after Boeing lost billions in Pentagon contracts, paid over $600 million to the government in fines and top Boeing and Air Force officials were sent to prison.At the heart of the scandal was a former Air Force official who was found to have been steering billions of dollars in contracts to Boeing -- some of them now being bid again -- while negotiating for employment at Boeing for herself and her family.Some say the helicopter selection shows that little has changed in the relationship.''By not enforcing the rules, the Air Force is showing an innate bias to one company,'' said Keith Ashdown, who wrote about the Air Force-Boeing scandal for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonprofit group that follows government spending.The helicopter program is one of the Air Force's highest priorities, and the impression of a pro-Boeing bias was further reinforced last Wednesday when the secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, went before a Congressional committee and endorsed the Boeing helicopter.''I'd like to stay with what we've got and get this program going as fast as possible,'' said Mr. Wynne, when talking to reporters outside the committee room, according to Dow Jones Newswires. On top of that, the Air Force issued a statement after the G.A.O. decision saying it believed that it could comply with the ''intent'' of the opinion ''narrowly.''The Air Force and Mr. Wynne's comments carry weight beyond the helicopter program, especially with an even bigger and more politically charged competition on the horizon. The Air Force is about to accept bids for a far more complex program -- a potentially $100 billion program for a new fleet of aerial refueling tankers that was at the center of the scandal.A previous attempt by the Air Force to award the tanker contract to Boeing collapsed when members of Congress, mainly Senator John McCain, raised questions and it became clear that Boeing had the inside track -- and a helping hand from a corrupt official.Now, two years later, the Air Force is taking up the tanker contract once gain. This time, it has pledged to play fair as it considers bids from Boeing and from a competing team using a tanker from Boeing's archrival, Airbus, which is seeking to gain Pentagon business.''Having just exited from a procurement scandal, the Air Force needs to look like it knows what it is doing,'' said Loren B. Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a military policy research group in northern Virginia.While the G.A.O. recommendation is nonbinding, it is rare that a government agency ignores its findings. Maj. Brenda Campbell, an Air Force spokeswoman, said she was unable to provide more clarification on what the Air Force meant when it said it would ''narrowly'' interpret the G.A.O. findings.The G.A.O. criticized only the financial analysis used to award Boeing the contract and did not comment on the relative merits of the different helicopters. The new rescue helicopters would not go into service until 2012. ''We have to map out where we go from here,'' Major Campbell said.Joseph LaMarca, a Boeing spokesman, said that the G.A.O. looked at many elements of the selection process and criticized only one aspect. He also said the company believed that the Boeing helicopter would still be picked ''when all is said and done.''The losers are not so sure. Mr. Caires, the Lockheed spokesman, asserted that his company's helicopter, the US 101, would win in the end. ''We are confident, when fairly evaluated, the US 101 will be selected as the best choice and best value,'' he said.Sikorsky's president, Jeffrey Pino, said in a statement that he has confidence his company's Superhawk, the successor to the current Pave Hawk, will prove to be the ''best platform for the Air Force's current and future needs.''As for the Air Force, it says it just needs a combat search-and-rescue helicopter, and soon. ''We need a helicopter that will fly higher, farther and is a more defensive system,'' said Major Campbell. ''We fly in bad weather. We fly at night. We do things the other services won't do.''</text></article><article id="1830080"><summary>Donna M Nickitas letter criticizes Pres Bush for seeking to restrict eligibility and financing for Children's Health Insurance Program</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Child Health Care Splits White House and States'' (front page, Feb. 27):As a registered nurse committed to promoting the health and well-being of children and families, I was deeply disappointed to read that President Bush will seek to restrict eligibility and financing for the Children's Health Insurance Program.Shame on you, Mr. President!

If a protracted decline has begun, one investment adviser is warning his clients, the sharpest reversals of fortune could be experienced in what have been some of the hottest sectors.The best market performers in the six months before the market's latest peak have been involved in information technology, industrial materials and manufacturing consumer discretionary items like cars, luxury goods and clothing. James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter and a diligent student of market history, points out that these groups have borne the brunt of declines since the early 1970s.When stocks embark on a correction or worse, blame is often assigned to a deterioration of the economy or to an acceleration that sends inflation and interest rates higher, which then results in weaker growth. Those three sectors are especially sensitive to economic conditions because businesses and individuals have some flexibility in timing purchases of those goods (that's where the ''consumer discretionary'' label comes from).Mr. Stack prefers sectors that are more resilient in downturns. His stock picks include purveyors of food and drinks like Diageo and PepsiCo and two makers of medical products, Dentsply International and Biomet.His peers like Mr. Stack's logic, but they point to developments that could make history play out a bit differently and that could make certain stocks in these sectors worth holding.''If you're going to invest in those sectors, you have to get more stock- specific,'' said Rick Drake, manager of the ABN Amro Growth fund. After the big move in share prices, he said, finding strong performers ''has become a much tougher game.''One potential winner, he said, is Starbucks, which has accelerated the pace of opening new stores. That ought to improve earnings growth for some time, he said, as business at the new units gets up to full speed.Mr. Drake's biggest tech holding is Electronic Arts, a maker of video games. Introductions of the latest Xbox and PlayStation models and of the new Wii put the company in ''a sweet spot of the video game console cycle,'' he said.Susan Byrne, manager of the Westwood Equity fund, identified herself as a ''pretty nervous investor'' who thinks that ''every day could be the last day'' of the bull market.What may extend the rally for some companies in these sectors, she said, is the global nature of their businesses. Certain technology and materials companies are proving tough competition in overseas markets where growth is fairly robust.The next downturn may hurt computer makers, Ms. Byrne said, likening them to companies that make razors but not blades. But she expects the blade makers, software producers like Oracle and Microsoft, to thrive. She also admires infrastructure specialists like Cisco Systems.Walter T. McCormick, lead manager of the Evergreen Fundamental Large Cap fund, is another fan of Cisco and Microsoft, two companies that he finds have performed ''absolutely marvelously.''''It's tough to cast a broad brush across all of technology,'' he said.Another stock that he expects to perform well is Automatic Data Processing, which is involved in data trafficking, including the processing of electronic transactions. Mr. Stack, despite his misgivings about the tech sector, also likes the stock.AS for the other hot sectors, Mr. McCormick is fairly bearish on materials, and with no trace of remorse, he acknowledged letting the rally in carmakers pass him by. He said he did not find the stocks to be good value and had no plans to buy now.Mr. Stack, in the interest of safety, has also been known to shun what he sees as unwarranted gains. He missed out on the late stages of the tech rally -- and the bear market that followed. He aggressively bought stocks again near the lows in 2003.He may be turning cautious too soon, but the bull market began four years ago. The median length of bull runs since the Great Depression is just more than three years. And after the recent strength in sectors whose best days may have passed, Mr. Stack has no qualms about preserving old gains instead of making new ones.''When the punch bowl is flowing and Wall Street is feeling giddy, the concept of risk management seems remote and unnecessary,'' he wrote in his Feb. 9 letter. ''Unfortunately, many of these so-called hot stocks or sectors turn out to be the most painful losers in the next bear market.''MARKET VALUES</text></article><article id="1830100"><summary>EMI Group rejects $4.1 billion takeover proposal from Warner Music Group (M)</summary><text>The EMI Group of Britain, which releases music by the Beatles and Bob Seger, rejected a $4.1 billion takeover proposal yesterday from the Warner Music Group, signaling the latest turn in a long merger dance.EMI said its board decided against Warner Music's cash offer, which was subject to ''numerous assumptions and conditions,'' because it was not in the best interests of shareholders and placed too low a value on the company.EMI, which has issued two profit warnings this year and is undertaking a broad restructuring, also said the offer carried regulatory uncertainty and ''unacceptable operational risk at a critical time'' for the company, which has been grappling with weak CD sales and sluggish industrywide sales of digital music.EMI also said the bid of 260 pence a share, or $5.07, represented an ''inadequate'' offer considering the risks and the potential cost savings of a merger. The offer reflects a 17 percent premium over EMI's share price at the time it last announced it had been approached by Warner Music.Wall Street analysts have considered a merger of EMI and Warner Music as inevitable, though many say the risk of antitrust regulators scotching the deal remains high and the companies' fortunes are uncertain. One analyst, Richard Greenfield of Pali Research, wrote two weeks ago that Warner Music's stock could be overvalued even if it purchased EMI at 250 pence a share.Warner Music declined to comment.Any deal would reshape the architecture of the music business, which is dominated by two giant conglomerates, the Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, each about twice the size of EMI or Warner Music.But recent talks between the companies have stalled on various issues, among them the question of who should bear the risk that regulators would block the transaction, according to executives briefed on the discussions. The two companies recently began new merger conversations after breaking off a round of talks last summer. At the time, Warner had offered 320 pence a share.Those talks stalled when a European court overturned a regulatory decision that cleared the 2004 merger of the music divisions of Sony and Bertelsmann. Antitrust regulators said this week that they would reconsider the deal for the next four months while they gather pricing data and other information.Warner Music officials thought they had raised the odds for an approval by striking an accord securing support from Impala, a European organization representing independent record labels, which had objected to previous tie-ups. But, in a protest gesture, one of the largest independent labels, Ministry of Sound, resigned from another British trade group that backed the deal.</text></article><article id="1830112"><summary>UA</summary><text>If information is power, then most employees who enter salary negotiations are holding pea shooters while the boss is encased in a Kevlar vest.Unless someone left a spreadsheet of the company's salaries on the copier (funny how often that does happen), most employees have precious little ammunition going into a meeting to talk about their pay.A few Web sites try to level the playing field by providing more detailed information about salaries. Salary.com began revealing the results of salary surveys on its site in 1999. PayScale.com is now challenging it by gathering information directly from the people who search for data. (A third site, Payscroll.com, is testing a method of trolling job listings for salary information. It will be opened to the public this month or next.)New Internet technologies are providing information that has never been available to the average person and transforming the way they sell homes or buy airline tickets. It could have the same effect on the 47 million people who look for new jobs each month and the countless others who think they are underpaid at the ones they have.Jessica Morrison, who wrote advertising copy for Drugstore.com in Seattle, was one of those. After five years at the company and several promotions, her title was associate editor even though she had the same duties as a copywriter, a loftier title. She also suspected that at $42,000 a year, she was paid a lot less than someone else with her duties.She checked PayScale, and its free report that compares her pay with others holding a similar job title said that someone with her experience should be making $50,000 to $60,000. Then she went to see her manager. ''I was a little nervous going in, but I had done my research,'' Ms. Morrison, 27, said. She got the title she wanted and a raise to within the pay range she suggested. ''If I had gone in without the information, the conversation would have been, 'I feel like I am not making enough money,' '' Ms. Morrison said.More extensive salary surveys are done for corporations, but a regular employee could not hope to buy the information from any of the other major compensation companies like the Hay Group or Mercer. ''We wouldn't give it to you,'' said Iain Fitzpatrick, general manager of the reward information service division of Hay. The compensation companies do not want their information being used against bosses negotiating salaries. ''The last thing we want is for a client to say, 'We just had a conversation with an employee who was quoting Hay data,' '' Mr. Fitzpatrick said.Unlike Salary.com, which obtains its information from a variety of surveys of corporate human resource departments, PayScale collects the information directly from people seeking the data. If you want PayScale's salary information, first you will have to tell them what you make. A basic report is free, but the company charges $20 for a more detailed analysis.PayScale, which supplies its data to job listing sites like CareerBuilder.com, Jobster.com and SimplyHired.com, says it uses search engine technology and a rules-based algorithm to match requests for data in a database of 5.5 million profiles.Executives at Salary.com, which provides its data to job boards at America Online, Yahoo, HotJobs.com and Monster.com, take issue with the new approach. Their survey found 96 percent of human resources departments do not trust user-reported data. William Coleman, senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com, said, ''People get information wrong.'' He said they often did not understand what benefits or bonuses they were getting, so he considered any self-reporting to be suspect.But Joe Giordano, the founder, chairman and also vice president for product development at PayScale, said its information was accurate. ''People come onto PayScale with no incentive to lie because they want high-quality information,'' he said.The company checks the information for inconsistencies, tossing out extremes. It said that about 50 percent of submissions were not included, but that it got enough, about 300,000 a month, that no single filing could influence the overall result. ''We collect more in one day than some companies collect in a year,'' said Michael Metzger, the chief executive.It takes about six minutes to fill in its questionnaire. PayScale asks for your title, the number of years in the field and your city. It then asks you to better define your job. If you said software programmer, it wants to know what kind of programmer and what programming languages you know. People in professions with a profusion of titles are asked more questions.Finally, it asks you questions about your employer, your education, and, of course, your salary and benefits.Then it computes the results and displays them on a graph so you can see the range. A senior software engineer in Silicon Valley with 20 years of experience makes $88,531 to $106,364. A benefits claims examiner in Indianapolis, who has been on the job for a decade, makes $41,122 to $54,821.Although Salary.com argues that its paid results are more accurate, its free Salary Wizard tool yields results that can barely differ: for example, a range of $84,289 to $107,711 for the programmer and $40,091 to $52,942 for the examiner.PayScale, which gets about a third of the traffic that Salary.com does, says it has information on jobs not usually found in corporate salary surveys like pornographic film actor (average salary: $63,275), rabbi (average salary: $98,610) and crossing guard (average hourly wage: $9.21), but so far no chick sexers, mimes or bloggers are in its roster. ''We don't get many boiler makers, but we get the jobs that are out there in volume,'' Mr. Giordano said.PayScale data also say that a chief executive in New York City averages $248,278. When you stop laughing, it quickly becomes apparent what the big problem with this site is. It is most accurate where it has lots of data. The company acknowledges that it is very good with high-tech jobs, health care and nonprofits because a lot of people from those professions have visited the site and filled out the questionnaire.Only 22 chief executives in New York City have bothered, and none apparently clocked more than a mere $235 an hour. ''It is only as good as what people are contributing,'' said James Holincheck, a research vice president at Gartner who follows the compensation industry. (Salary.com's result was a bit more realistic: a range of $417,459 to $1,266,936.)But the sites are meant for the average person, not titans of finance and industry.''It's like the Kelly Blue Book for compensation,'' Mr. Giordano said. Like that reference manual for used-car prices, the salary sites give you a good idea of where to start the negotiations confidently.Persuading the boss you need more money demands more than a report from an online service. You have to think about the kind of company that employs you. A start-up might pay lower salaries because employees have a chance to make a killing on options when it goes public or is sold. Some companies have a policy of high turnover, so raises are rarely in the offing.Mr. Coleman suggests that people think about quality-of-life issues, as well as the money. For instance, sometimes it is easier for an employer to give an additional week of vacation rather than a 2 percent raise. A workweek condensed into four days might hold some value even though you will work no less -- and probably will work more. ''Money isn't everything, but it isn't nothing,'' he said.If you want more detailed information on multiple job offers in different regions, PayScale charges $20. Salary.com charges $30 to $100 for detailed reports depending on the level of the position.Both sites offer advice and scores of ways to parse the information they have collected. Salary.com measures the salary of a stay-at-home mom. (The statisticians calculated that doing the housekeeping, cooking, babysitting, chauffeuring, administration and other jobs involved in staying at home with a preschooler in Chicago would probably take around 91 hours a week and be worth about $146,000.) Pay-Scale finds that based on the answers to a question it asks about commutes, for example, a store manager in Seattle gets to work 17 minutes faster than one in New York City. That has to be worth something.YOUR MONEY</text></article><article id="1830133"><summary>First Look Studios' chief executive-chairman Henry Winterstern resigns abruptly (S)</summary><text>Henry Winterstern, the chief executive and a chairman of the independent film distributor First Look Studios, resigned abruptly on Friday, the company announced.

The results mean that ranchers whose sheep were killed will not be eligible for reimbursement from a fund for livestock losses.

Like you're sending a desperate alarm to the other wolves! -- and Win down in the sanctuary trying to keep the upright double bass and tenor sax from veering toward smooth jazz, and Jeremy picking through dozens of black-metal shipping crates to make sure the equipment's all there -- Win's dobro, R&#233;gine's hurdy-gurdy, the glockenspiel, the accordions, the giant Asian cymbals and the neon Jesus sign -- everything packed up tight and ready to be shipped off to London for the start of the band's yearlong world tour. It's a snowy January night just outside Montreal, and each time the front door opens, gusts of frigid air blow through the nave: Hey, close the. . . . Oh, it's Liza! Hey everybody, Liza's here! Earlier, the church got so crowded that Sarah had to record her violin part (R&#233;gine: Make it weird, like a ghost violin, a sci-fi violin, a violin from outer space!) squished into the sound booth while Richie took his guitar into the stairwell because someone was playing a Mexican reveille on the trumpet and there was a French horn warming up in the kitchen.When the members of the Arcade Fire, a Montreal art-rock band led by Win Butler and his wife, R&#233;gine Chassagne, were trying to find studio space to record their second full-length album, they took an inventory of their instruments -- the hurdy-gurdy and the accordions, but also the baby-grand and upright pianos, the organ and the harpsichord, the xylophone and the Caribbean steel drums. Then they considered the acoustics that would best suit their music -- a kind of surging, post-punk rock with dense orchestrations cut through with painful and, at times, quite beautiful noise collages. Finally, they discussed their ambition to record their rousing, emotionally charged songs with the entire band playing live, though the band has seven permanent members and swells, when strings and horns are added, into an antic carnival orchestra. With the men in suspenders and vests and the women in dresses and lace fingerless gloves, and everyone employing yelps, hand claps, megaphones (for vocal distortion), motorcycle helmets (so they can drum on each other's heads) and the occasional snare drum tossed high into the air, an Arcade Fire show has the feel of a Clash concert infiltrated by Cirque du Soleil.Given its outsize musical ambitions and unabashed theatricality, the Arcade Fire could have filled a three-ring recording studio. The place it ultimately found to record ''Neon Bible,'' the band's follow-up to its successful and surprisingly poised 2004 debut album, ''Funeral,'' was a 19th-century redbrick church in a small farm town an hour outside of Montreal. The church already had a stage in front, a hundred-foot ceiling that returned rich, live-sounding reverberations and a rear balcony that could be turned into a glassed-in sound booth. Once they bought the place, moved in their equipment and hired two engineers, all they had to do was convert the basement into bedrooms and hire Liza (Win's brother's fianc&#233;e's younger sister) as their cook so they could live out there for most of last year, working roughly three weeks on, one off, sometimes playing through the wee hours to get their meticulously arranged and recorded songs just right. (''Neon Bible'' will be released March 6.)The church-turned-recording-studio, the year of living undergraduately -- those were merely the latest unexpected events that have transpired since the Arcade Fire started playing hole-in-the-wall clubs in Toronto and Montreal four years ago, then put out ''Funeral,'' an album that, largely because of word-of-blog and a gushing review on pitchforkmedia.com, the influential music Web site (an album ''at last capable of completely and successfully restoring the tainted phrase 'emotional' to its true origin''), would go on to sell 750,000 copies, which is a lot for an album that was recorded for $10,000. Once ''Funeral'' was released, the small gigs started selling out, only to be replaced by larger gigs that sold out too, and before long the Arcade Fire was touring North America and Europe and playing to rapt audiences in Japan and Brazil. Most of the band members are in their mid- to late 20s, but the keyboardist and bass player, Will Butler, who is Win's younger brother, had to ask his professors at Northwestern for permission to miss class so he could appear with the band on Conan O'Brien. Fortunately, he'd graduated by the time David Byrne wrote them a fan letter and joined them onstage for a cover of his song ''This Must Be The Place,'' and David Bowie (who'd been giving ''Funeral'' to his friends) asked them to cover ''Queen Bitch'' at one of their shows and made a surprise appearance in a white suit and straw hat. After the band opened three arena-size shows for U2 in Montreal and Ottawa, Bono and his mates pronounced the Arcade Fire their favorite new act.''It was crazy, hilarious, totally surreal,'' Will says.''Weird times!'' R&#233;gine sings.''Somewhere along the line we became the band that was supposed to save rock 'n' roll,'' says Richie Parry, who also plays upright double bass.Wild, sudden success for a band is often the moment Puccini takes over the script (often, too, the moment a band is inspired to make a second album, about the burdens of wild, sudden success), but the Arcade Fire has managed to avoid any gestures toward the operatic. ''I can definitely say that playing with David Byrne was one of the most weird, wonderful and lucky things we've experienced as musicians,'' Richie says. ''Onstage that night, we were all making eye contact with each other -- you know, something so impossible and far away that we were all of a sudden holding in our hands.'' The musicians seem to have strengthened their collective immunity to hype by resolutely doing what they want: they turned down the chance to tour with R.E.M. so they could continue performing their full-length shows; they refused to play Britain's ''Top of the Pops,'' on which bands traditionally lip-sync their material, until they were permitted to play live; and they resisted the entreaties of several major record companies, made over a series of lavish dinners, to leave Merge, the independent label that released ''Funeral.''''For 'Neon Bible,' we met with a lot of dudes, but honestly it wasn't that interesting,'' Win says. ''Merge is like the labels used to be, based on someone's tastes and interest in music --''''--instead of statistics and marketing,'' R&#233;gine says.''If you look at the Web sites of a lot of the majors,'' Win goes on, ''they're selling everything -- hip-hop, country, Disney soundtracks. It's the throw-a-lot-of-garbage-at-the-wall --''''-- and-see-what-sticks strategy,'' R&#233;gine says ''But at least we got to stay in some nice hotels, didn't we? And we ate good food for a month! And we didn't lie to anyone either: Right from the start, we made it clear we'd never sign with them. I mean, why would we?''Even now that the Arcade Fire has been consecrated as Canada's most celebrated musical export of the moment (Time Canada put the band on its cover), its members still seem to navigate by a compass calibrated toward whatever will bring them the most subversive fun. When it came time to release material from ''Neon Bible,'' instead of following some professional marketing strategy, they used laptops and iMovie to create a video for YouTube in the style of a late-night, self-help infomercial -- ''call now!'' -- then set up a toll-free number where callers could press one button to hear music and another to leave messages, some of which were posted on the band's Web site. ''It was sort of a joke about viral marketing, and viral marketing at the same time,'' Win says. ''Did it work as real marketing? I have no idea.'' To try out new material in performance before heading to London, the band played two benefit gigs -- one at Richie's old high school in Ottawa (in a reversal of adult-world protocol, you had to be in high school and show a valid under-age ID to get in), the other in a church basement in the Polish neighborhood in Montreal where most of the band members live.''Hey, did someone remember to invite the guys from the pirogi shop?''''Yeah, I told them we were playing across the street, and they said, 'That's our church!' I put them all on the guest list.''''Did they come? Did they like the show? God, at one point I was climbing all over the piano. I wonder if they got mad.''''No, no, they loved it!''Despite the satisfaction it takes in upending rock-business convention, however, the Arcade Fire has shrewdly kept control of its affairs -- paying for both albums itself, buying its own studio to record the second album and retaining the rights to all the master recordings; the band distributes its music by setting up licensing deals (with Merge in North America, with Universal in Europe). ''The idea of someone else owning what we do is insane when we did all the work,'' Win says. And for all their iconoclastic spirit, the musicians are not unmindful of the considerable power they have accumulated. One day in January, the band's personal assistant's car was towed from the lot of a Tim Hortons doughnut shop, even though she was inside buying a dozen glazed at the time. Upon hearing news of this affront, the guitarist Tim Kingsbury suggested they post the matter on arcadefire.com and get free doughnuts for life. ''You know,'' said Jeremy Gara, the drummer, ''I'd like to use that technique to bring down Bell Canada.''Now, as the huge church windows frame rural darkness and some swirling tornadoes of snow, Liza announces, ''Dinner's ready!'' and a general clatter (''Awesome! . . . We love you, Liza!'') erupts as the band members head toward the kitchen with its ceiling streamers and its long, candle-lit table already stocked with baskets of bread and bottles of merlot. Win wants to know how long it will take to get a new passport, because after the six-month ''Funeral'' tour there are no pages left in his old one. Will is musing on the ethics of putting video games on the band's expense account, and Sarah Neufeld, the violinist, points out that some groups on tour rack up a grand per night just on booze. Marika Anthony-Shaw (violist for the live shows) asks if Sarah's planning to take her violin on the plane as carry-on, because there's no way Marika's going to check her viola, not after what happened at that notorious show: Win, whose full-throttle playing can explode into confrontation, heard the band's previous drummer mess up his part and screamed -- perfectly in time to the music -- No! No! No! No! which caused the drummer to erupt in fury and hurl his drums across the stage, catching Marika with the high-hat and snapping the bridge of her viola in two. (''Dude!'' said a surprised Win. ''It was part of the moment!'')Win Butler, R&#233;gine Chassagne, Will Butler, Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury, Jeremy Gara, Sarah Neufeld -- all of them crowding together, massaging one another's shoulders like actors in the school play and grabbing for empty plates so that Liza can dole out steaming ladles of pasta from her ginormous pot -- this is the Arcade Fire, born in Montreal, soon to play London, New York and 5,000-seat venues in Dublin, Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo, Stockholm and Berlin, perhaps the biggest sensation right now on the world indie-music scene.A week later, in the East London recording studio where the Arcade Fire was unpacking and about to rehearse for its sold-out five-night stand at (appropriately) a church-turned-concert-hall just off the Thames, space was getting tight. All those black-metal crates from the Montreal church were laid out on a cramped soundstage, and wouldn't you know, R&#233;gine couldn't find the cord for her hurdy-gurdy. While she anxiously rummaged through the boxes, Win tried to talk her down; surely the technical crew could find a replacement. But the cord was really the least of the musicians' concerns: although they had been rehearsing since completing ''Neon Bible'' in the fall, they hadn't toured in more than a year; aside from playing to a bunch of high-schoolers and the guys from the pirogi shop (and playing a little chaotically too), they had performed almost none of the new material live; the band was now 10 separate musicians in search of an arresting group persona for their 11 new songs, which differed musically and lyrically from anything they had done before.''Some people get so rabid at our shows,'' Richie said. ''They get these cathartic experiences. And they'll say it too: 'We saw you that time at so-and-so; it was the best thing we ever saw!' which does give me a twinge of pride. That's what I always wanted at a rock show -- to sweat and cry and scream a lot. But with this new material, we may have to back off a bit. We don't want to be shticky, and an improvisatory spirit will help us get around that. The trick is keeping open. You know: What fun thing can we do tonight?''''Maybe we'll need to be less confrontational,'' Tim said. ''Or maybe we'll need to be more confrontational. Or maybe just less obviously confrontational.''''Clearly our performance style has to change,'' Win said. ''If you just say, 'This is our thing; this is what we do,' then it is shtick. So, yeah, we may be less intense with this material, although I suspect we'll always be pretty intense.''Win is six-foot-five, with coat-hanger shoulders and messy blond fly-away hair shaved to punk perfection around the ears. At 26, he has large, penetrating eyes and not even the shadow of a beard. Although he sings at times with a tight-throated, high-pitched fervor that brings to mind David Byrne with the Talking Heads, when he instructs the band, he tends to gather his thoughts in silence, then lay them out in quiet, commanding lines: ''You need to tighten those runs and bring them down an octave or you're going to sound like Pat Metheny,'' he'll say to the string and brass players. Meanwhile, R&#233;gine, who is 30, with quick brown eyes and a pile of curly dark hair that reaches only to her husband's sternum, will riff excitedly on an idea for a guitar solo (Let it hang between the breaths of the melody ... like an -- I don't know -- like an airplane ... make it really fourth dimension!) and then, frustrated by her failures of metaphor, will rise onto her stockinged toes to dance the line of a lazy guitar lick that lingers behind a song's principal melody and -- body suspended, then tripping forward -- catches it just at the end. Most everyone associated with the Arcade Fire talks about the band's ''democratic'' and ''communal'' spirit; even the temporary string and horn players relish their autonomy and the chance to experiment creatively with their parts. ''We're trying to bring something to people that we can do only as a group,'' Richie says. ''If it works, that can -- hopefully -- balance any personal frictions that arise from a band made up of personalities that are so strong it can sometimes make you a little crazy. Most of the time it does. There's also a genuine lack of egotism in this band that serves us well; people get out of the way of an idea that's working. So it is an open democracy and a creative space. But at the end of the day, Win is very much the leader of this band -- because of his strong personality, and the fact that he was founder and writes most of the songs. Win is King and R&#233;gine is Queen, and we all figure out the rest.''Win, who was raised in the Houston suburbs and arrived in Montreal after four years at Phillips Exeter and one at Sarah Lawrence, grew up playing guitar and listening to Radiohead, the Pixies, the Smiths and the Cure. R&#233;gine, who was born in Montreal of Haitian parents, was studying jazz singing, playing mandolin in a medieval ensemble and doing compositional experiments with 15th-century music when the two met at McGill University.Win: ''We met in the school cafeteria. A week later I went to see her singing jazz. It was immediately obvious to me that she was a real singer. I even left before she was done. I didn't need to see the rest; it was so obvious we needed to play together.''R&#233;gine: ''I remember he came one night to hear me sing, but he left before it was over -- I thought he didn't like it! And when I saw him later, I asked what he played, and when he said, 'Oh, some guitar, a little piano,' I thought: Bo-ring! Everyone plays a little guitar and piano! But right away, I was struck by the maturity of his songs. This was not just some dude noodling around on his guitar trying to impress me.''Win: ''We were coming from such different worlds, but when I played my stuff for her, right away she had ideas -- for accordion, for all this weird medieval stuff.''R&#233;gine: ''I was from another planet. I didn't even know what an 'indie' band was -- it sounded so vague and mysterious. But Win wrote really good, catchy melodies (though with fairly typical chord changes, I thought), and right away I had all these ideas I wanted him to try: strange progressions, beats, instruments. And: enough with the acoustic guitar!''Win: ''We started playing together and went on a date that same night. It wasn't like, this could work. It was more like, this does work. And we haven't been apart for more than a week since.''The Arcade Fire sound -- catchy pop melodies and thick dissonances; raw, imperfect rock with flawless symphonic arrangements -- originates with that pairing of Win's indie roots and R&#233;gine's classical training. But the exhilarating spectacle the band creates for its live shows arises from the conflagration of energies, the barely controlled chaos of seven precocious musicians, all of whom play multiple instruments (sometimes swapping between songs, sometimes swapping within songs) and who generate countermelodies, sonic textures and onstage interactions that are part riotous play, part unnerving provocation. There's Richie, who plays bowed double bass and taught himself an idiosyncratic electric guitar (he appears to be wringing the neck of a dead chicken) and embraces the use of police sirens and megaphones; and Will, the technically dextrous, highly tactile keyboardist, who often leaves the ivories to bait Richie onstage, grabbing his friend's double bass or drumming on his head with sticks or enacting various scenes of mock-torture; and Jeremy, the amply-tattooed heavy-metal enthusiast, who pummels the drums (or the piano when R&#233;gine takes a turn on percussion) with such ferocity that Win sometimes looks back and thinks Jeremy's arms are going to snap right off.Despite its exuberant, sometimes triumphalist sound, ''Funeral'' looked at the world lyrically through introspective and, at times, quite mournful eyes -- its songs were about family, relationships and the tenuous bonds of community. With ''Neon Bible,'' Win and R&#233;gine have taken on larger themes, writing elliptical narratives about the ambivalence of faith, the challenge of living with fear and the possibility of apocalypse. Musically, their writing has evolved as well: in addition to several numbers that, like their previous work, tilt toward bombast, ''Neon Bible'' includes a hymn (''Intervention''), some blues (''Antichrist Television Blues''), even an Appalachian-inflected ballad (''My Body Is a Cage'').When the time came to record ''Neon Bible,'' the new material tested the band's endurance and ingenuity. Although one song, ''Black Wave/Bad Vibrations,'' was a pure studio creation, a Frankenstein of overdubs, for all the other songs the band passed up the safety net of digital technology and recorded the so-called bed tracks with the band playing on the church stage and onto analog tape, thereby forcing everyone to commit to the intensity of a live performance from the start of each take to its end. ''Not many bands record like that anymore,'' says their engineer, Markus Dravs, who worked with Bjork in a similarly improvised live-in space in the Spanish mountains and was Brian Eno's house engineer for four years. ''But they embraced the chaos. They were like, Let's everybody play in the room and throw mikes at it and see how it sounds! Let's jump off a cliff and see what happens at the bottom!'' On one song, the final vocal was the first one recorded: The band set up on the church stage; Win went outside onto the back steps with headphones and a mandolin and sang into the night.After the musicians completed the initial tracks for each song, they proceeded to layer the album with some ambitious new sounds. For ''The Well and the Lighthouse,'' they wanted to distort the sound of R&#233;gine's voice on the choruses, so Dravs figured out how to create a Buddy Holly-style tape delay of enormous proportions by feeding her voice again and again through the 24 heads of his sound deck, which kept extending the gap between the original vocal and its strange, degraded echo until he achieved the aural equivalent of a stadium full of spectators doing the wave. (Dravs: ''This band's very good at knowing what they want; they just haven't read enough manuals.'') For ''My Body Is a Cage'' and ''Intervention,'' Win and R&#233;gine heard in their aural imaginations the sound of a mighty organ, so they rented the Saint-Jean-Baptiste church in Montreal with its 500-pipe instrument; after an engineer miked the entire place, R&#233;gine recorded the parts in a series of single takes (though there was a half-second delay between depressing the keys and the overwhelming sound it generated) while the band tracks played into her headphones. For ''Black Mirror,'' ''Keep the Car Running'' and ''No Cars Go,'' Win and R&#233;gine wanted a fuller sound than could be achieved by their own ragtag orchestra, so they went to Budapest (no union rules and a good rate on the Canadian dollar) and recorded their arrangements with a 60-piece orchestra and a military choir.Four years ago, when the Arcade Fire first started performing its songs from ''Funeral,'' it took the band six months to create the kind of show that eventually brought it such renown. Now, with a highly anticipated album about to come out, a year of tour dates lined up and one night to go before they were to begin their five-show run in London, the musicians were still groping their way forward -- trying to find portable (and performable) ways of recreating the symphonic richness of ''Neon Bible'' by reworking vocal approaches and instrumental arrangements and improvising new bits of theater. ''I don't think we've found our footing,'' Richie said when the band finished rehearsing in the East London studio. ''The old numbers know themselves as live songs, but the new ones still feel like young calves on weak legs.''''Yeah, that was rough,'' Will said. ''The logistics get hard when the band swells to 10 or more.''''O.K., sowe were sweaty and jet-lagged,'' Jeremy said. ''But, 'bad rehearsal, good show.' Isn't that what they always say?''Outside St. John's Church, in a lovely, tucked-away Georgian square, the line started forming at 4 o'clock for the 8 p.m. show, and when the audience finally filed into the majestic, high-ceilinged church and faced a stage packed with musical equipment, several megaphones on tripods and a red-velvet curtain draped in back with the projected image of a neon bible, Richie said he could feel it in his bones: ''Seems like the crowd is as nervous as we are. This is a crowd with really high expectations; they want that cathartic experience. But they're a little ahead of themselves; they don't know the new songs; they don't know how they're going to get excited. You know: This will be awesome! But the unspoken message is: Hope so!''The Arcade Fire -- all 10 of them -- entered from the back of the sanctuary (anything to break that barrier between performer and audience), and walked up the aisle, Win smiling and clapping and gesturing for everyone to get up on their feet. Right away the band ripped into the new material, going full-tilt at four new songs in a row, but even with Win attacking the vocals with his dangerous, stone-faced visage; and R&#233;gine holding her red-laced fingers up to the corners of her eyes like Cleopatra as she sang; and Will running back and forth beating a snare drum and throwing it up, end over end, something was missing the mark. The energy coming from the stage seemed to dissipate among the crowd; the sound was all low-register drums and bass, drowning out those obsessively arranged horns and violins; and when songs ended, the audience clapped enthusiastically, if a little too respectfully. Win acknowledged as much from behind his mike: ''I guess it's our own damn fault for playing in a church,'' he said. ''How are you? Good? Yeah, everything's going good with us too: jet lag, antibiotics. ...'' They played a 60-minute show and left the stage looking almost as uncertain as they did at the start.As they were filing out of the sanctuary, however, the band briefly conferred, then took a spontaneous turn and headed for the church door. ''Come outside!'' R&#233;gine yelled to the crowd. And while the audience trailed after them onto the stone steps, the band collected around a megaphone and sang an unrehearsed acoustic version of ''Wake Up,'' its most popular song from ''Funeral.'' On disc, ''Wake Up'' is anthemic -- U2 plays it over the loudspeakers before its shows; Madison Square Garden uses it to jazz up the crowd at Rangers' games. Here, in the secluded, lamp-lit square, with their breath visible in the wintery night air, the musicians gave it an unexpected intimacy; with an accordion, a dobro and a tambourine, they looked like a circle of carolers, and before the first chorus ended, the band had the crowd in a sing-along.If the Arcade Fire is confident about anything, it's the value of a good piece of stagecraft and the ways that playing with it, riffing with it night after night before an audience, eventually helps the music begin to live and breathe. So the following night, instead of walking straight to the stage, the band started its show with its encore, gathering in the middle of the crowded sanctuary to reprise its acoustic performance of ''Wake Up.'' After the crowd reveled in this seemingly spontaneous gesture, the band members took the stage with purpose in their step. ''We had a little problem last night with people thinking we were playing in a church,'' Win said to the crowd. ''People were quiet. A little too respectful. I'm here tonight to say: This nonaggression shall not stand!''A few days earlier, not long after the Arcade Fire had arrived in London, Win was sitting in the lobby of the band's hotel, talking about the music he'd listened to growing up and how inspiring it was to watch his favorite artists evolve -- Dylan giving up his Woody Guthrie imitation to find a mode of expression all his own, the Clash trying to sound like the Ramones and, in the course of failing, becoming unique. ''Expression is where you define yourself as an artist,'' he said. ''And expression always has to change.''R&#233;gine walked in, and for a moment the two started talking, worrying over some details about the following night's show. Then Win said: ''When we were working on 'Neon Bible,' I had this dream -- well, it was a nightmare, really. I had this image of being in a boat in the ocean in the middle of the night. I could feel the boat going up and down, but it was so black out there; I couldn't see anything.''''I had that experience, too,'' R&#233;gine said avidly. ''I was backpacking once, going from France to Corsica at night, and I was at the top of a giant boat at 2 in the morning, everything so black, and me feeling so small. I remember thinking, If I fall in, I could so easily disappear!''''It's funny how the word 'fear' can mean so many different things,'' Win went on. ''There's a natural fear that's about self-preservation -- ''''-- yeah, the fear that makes you want to protect yourself and fight what's coming in,'' R&#233;gine said. ''But then there's the fear that's bigger than yourself and makes you want to do things, be inventive.''''That's the fear that -- rather than working to support the way you already are -- makes you want to change.''Just then their assistant manager walked into the lobby and told them they'd better quit talking: they had a rehearsal in half an hour, and five shows to do that week.Darcy Frey is a contributing writer and the author of ''The Last Shot,'' and has written for the magazine on music, science and the environment.</text></article><article id="1830264"><summary>Jing Tio, second-generation Indonesian spice trader and passionate home cook, travels the world introducing chefs to new spices; recipes (M)</summary><text>Seasoning with salt and pepper has taken on new meaning in recent years -- for professional and home cooks alike. For this we might have a former accountant in California to thank. Traveling the world with a suitcase filled with spices and gadgets, Jing Tio is something of a spice whisperer, introducing chefs, and diners, to new flavors. He turned Wylie Dufresne at New York's WD-50 on to wild hops, which recently made their debut in a savory pudding, and the pastry chef at Jo&#235;l Robuchon at the Mansion in Las Vegas now makes ice cream with the herbal coffee substitute teeccino. Hops and teeccino: coming soon to a spice rack near you.A second-generation Indonesian spice trader and a passionate home cook, Tio, 33, was an accountant and property manager in Southern California until his frustration with the lack of high-end culinary equipment and ingredients led him to sell his cars -- all six of them -- to open Le Sanctuaire in Santa Monica. The Barneys of cooking stores, it sells everything from Herm&#232;s porcelain to Pacojet ice-cream makers, Ferran Adri&#224;'s Texturas-brand agar to $125 cooking chopsticks. Beach-bound Angelenos have been stumped by the boutique's rarefied offerings since it opened in 2003, but chefs realized that Tio was a kindred spirit, someone who, when asked what he cooks with eucalyptus leaves, shrugs and says, ''Usually just a foam.''Chefs also realized that Tio's spices were different. His mother supplied him with peppercorns -- black, white, red, cubeb, Sichuan, long pepper, four grades of tellicherry -- that were still bright and round, not the dusty, desiccated fruits you usually see. ''Spices can last maybe two or three years, depending on how well you store them,'' Tio says in accented English. ''But most of the spice that the consumer gets is already two, three years old.'' So he made arrangements with Indonesian spice growers and began selling directly to chefs.''The spice trade is really tricky,'' Tio says with a laugh. ''People want the money quick. Sometimes they harvest too fast, and the black pepper's not dry enough, and mold starts growing. And then they cover it -- you know when you cut the battery? The black dust? You don't wanna know!'' Now Tio and his mother have a 50-50 partnership with farmers on Java, Sumatra and Banda islands. Tio also uses sources in India, China and Malaysia, changing suppliers whenever quality dips. He is already on his fourth Sichuan-pepper grower on Sumatra.Tio says that he is less interested in novelty, but many of the spices that he imports are still exotic to the American palate, like yarrow flower, cypress nuts and kola-nut powder, all of which sit in large glass jars in a back room of his shop. Asked about the pretty buds in one, Tio says they are pistachio flowers but doesn't know what to do with them yet. ''I just got excited,'' he says. Chefs get excited, too, seeing spices that are so fresh as to be unrecognizable: bright green fennel seeds, plump black cardamom pods, still-spiky cloves, curled cinnamon sticks as thick as a cigar.These items make their way into Tio's suitcase, and to the plates of restaurantgoers around the world. He currently works with about 500 chefs, including Adri&#224;, Corey Lee at the French Laundry, David Kinch at Manresa and Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park. The spice-driven menu at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco, with its eight-course salt-and-pepper tasting, makes the chef Ron Siegel's relationship with Tio clear. ''He makes it easy to want to do new stuff,'' says Siegel, who recently introduced a line of flavored salts created with Tio.''It's word of mouth,'' Tio says of his expanding clientele. ''If somebody likes your products, they just call all their buddies and say, 'Hey, you ought to check out this spice dude.' '' He begins by eating at the restaurant he has been summoned to, then packs his suitcase accordingly on the next visit. ''I always come up with new stuff, depending on what I think will get the chef excited,'' he says. ''Really, I'm a muse to them. Not only spice. I bring them books, plates -- not all of them, but. . . .'' His dream, he says, is to find his ''soulmate chef'' to work with exclusively, followed by opening his own restaurant. In addition to a new San Francisco location, Tio plans to roll out chef-centric Le Sanctuaires in New York, Chicago and Spain in the next five years.Tio is already an off-site chef of sorts, making spice mixes, like his take on vadouvan, a heady blast of garlic, onion, shallot, curry and other spices (for Kinch, he added a floral element), or a four-pepper blend for Humm. ''This year I come up with the ool-timate spice,'' he says. He has discovered a top-secret salt source in Africa and is considering importing the South American dried ant heads he tasted at the recent Slow Food conference (''Really, really lemony''). Capitalizing on the trend toward sci-fi cuisine, Tio now distributes xanthan and other gums through a leading hydrocolloid company.But thanks to Tio, nature's bells and whistles still seduce: ''It's not just about introducing me to new spices,'' Humm says. ''He's constantly reminding me of all the spices that are out there.''Beet and Goat Cheese Salad1 1/2 pounds (3 medium) red beets1 1/2 pounds (3 medium) yellow beets (red beets may be substituted)1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oilKosher salt2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil2 teaspoons aged balsamic vinegar4 ounces fresh soft goat cheese Fleur de selFour-Pepper Mix or freshly ground black pepper12 nasturtium leaves, optional.1.

But the commotion roused the soldiers, who have taken Amram and Hanukkah hostage and inadvertently reunited Amram and Filaq.It was remarked by one of the eminent physician-rabbis of the city of Regensburg, in his commentary on the Book of Samuel, a work now lost but quoted in the responsa of Rabbi Judah the Pious, that apart from Torah the only subject truly worthy of study is the science of saving men's lives. Measured by the criterion of this teaching -- propounded by his grandfather -- Zelikman counted two great scholars among his present acquaintance, and one of them was a horse.As he backed, feinting and thrusting with Lancet at the Arsiyah who surrounded him, all of them wide awake now but not entirely free, as any of them would have been ready to attest, of dreamlike bafflement at the sight of a gaunt moonlit phantom who menaced them with an overgrown bloodletting fleam, feeling his way with the boot heel of his hind foot through the doubtful maze of unstrung tents and plunging horses that loomed at his back, Zelikman felt a sharp jab on the shoulder. He whirled to find that he had been bitten, with implicit reproof at his foolhardiness in trying to rescue Amram single-handedly from an entire company of heavily armed cavalrymen, by the bastard offspring of a mountain tarpan and an Arab dam whose bloodlines ran all the way back to one of Al Khamsa, the five mother mares of the Prophet's own stable.Zelikman threw his arm around Hillel's neck and nodded to the soldiers, and murmuring a phrase in the horse-charming mother tongue of his Abyssinian partner urged Hillel to split the narrow gap between two huge men with lances who were just now bearing down on him, and displaying no grace whatsoever and suffering a painful encounter between his teeth and his tongue executed the difficult maneuver of mounting a horse at full gallop. To outside observers, of which thankfully there could be, in the darkness, on this desolate slope of a Caucasus, very few, he must have looked as if he were trying not to mount Hillel's saddle so much as to perform some foul outrage upon his neck.The grooms had been busy gathering in the scattered horses, and troopers were soon mounted and in pursuit of Hillel as he carried Zelikman back up the slope heading south. But while the Khazar horses were sturdy and sure-footed and bred to the steep, rocky tracks, like Hillel, all heart and lung and back, with hooves so hard they required no shoes, they lacked speed and the ineffable Arabian humor: a demonic intelligence that lay somewhere between perversity and fire. By the time he gained the pass, the pursuers were far behind. Hillel chose his way down to the fold in the rock where Hanukkah's dray and Porphyrogene waited. Zelikman drew a slow breath that felt as if it might have been his first inhalation since the moment he had seen Amram charging bareback into the heart of the camp. As he breathed out, tears came to his eyes. He wept silently, after the custom of shamed and angry men, so that when the pursuit party came tumbling, pounding, scrabbling down the trail, past the fold in which he and Hillel stood concealed, he could hear the creak and rattle of their leather armor with its scales of horn, and when the Arsiyah returned just before daybreak, at the very hour when all of creation seemed to fall silent as if fighting off tears, Zelikman could hear the rumbling of the men's bellies and the grit in their eyelids and the hollowness of failure sounding in their chests.He waited until he saw a small lizard emerge from a fissure in the rock and creep toward a narrow medallion of sunlight on the granite, and then he crept out from his hiding place and led Hillel up over the rise again and back down into the valley, where the tents had been struck and the horses rounded up and saddled and the troops moved out north along the road. Zelikman followed the track northward for five leagues or more and then came to a barren place where another road branched away running more east than north toward the shore of the great inland sea. A small mound of stones marked the presence in this place, at one time if not today, of some ancient god of the crossroads. If you kept on to the north you would come, Hanukkah had told them, to Atil, the Khazar capital, at the mouth of a river that was also called Atil, though some called it Volga. A fresh trail of horse dung and hoof prints marked the northeast road; the Arsiyah were bound for the Caspian shore.He followed them east for two days, in a steady downpour most of the way, through flooded gorges and spattering mud. The Arsiyah drove themselves hard, taking brief rest, lighting no fires, and after a day of bitter pursuit Zelikman understood their desperation. They were rushing to the relief of a regiment or a town that they feared might already be lost. Near dawn of the third day he caught his first whiff of the sea and narrowed the distance between himself and the Muhammadan troops until he could see the thongs of cloth-of-gold that enlaced their black queues, the splashes of mud on their leggings. As he came up a rise, he smelled smoke, and half a breath later he saw it, boiling and black. A thick, greasy smell like that which had hung over the stronghold in Azerbaijan. It was the smell of burning animals.Hillel nickered and stepped sideways, and Zelikman mocked him tenderly for his cowardice. He swung down from the saddle and crept up to the top of the rise and trained the Persian glass on the ruination of a walled town built beside a broad estuary, flat roofs and minarets and a great white mosque giving up their matter and form to heaven in black gas and thick flakes of ash. Through the wooden gates, long strings of men and women and animals knotted and coiled as the townspeople abandoned their lives.Along the waterfront, burned ships broke slowly into black pieces, and the slant sails of dhows caught fire. Standing off beyond the shallows, dragon prows surveyed the despoiling of the walled town. Fair-haired Northmen in jerseys of barbarous red poled out to their ships on wide barges heavy-laden with bales and casks, with kegs and sacks and huddled women, and handed them up to their fellows on the decks, and poled back to the wharves again for more. The red-shirted men swarmed in the streets, and a dozen of them were at work with irons, prying loose the golden sheeting that clad the domes and minaret spires of the great mosque. They worked quickly, and without their usual piling up of booty on the shore for the elaborate rites of their thievish creed, probably because some lookout not distracted by rape or robbery had chanced to gaze down from the shattered walls of the city and see the company of horsemen charging hard for the town gates.There was a turbulence around those gates now as, driving out the survivors, bright-shirted men put their shoulders to the oak beams and sealed off the living from the dead, the loot from the looted, and bought themselves the time they would need, or so they hoped, to get away. Zelikman had observed firsthand the thievery of Northmen, whom the people of this shore called the Rus, and what he had not witnessed he had learned from Amram, who had served alongside blond Varangian giants in the armies of the emperor. They were insane with bravery and fools for battle, but like men from one end of the world to the other, they were slaves to their appetites and to their love of treasure, and with their decks piled high with gold, fresh meat and casks of Georgian wine, the Northmen must as a matter of highest principle choose profitable retreat over the doubtful glories of combat.As they approached the town, the advance riders of the Arsiyah became entangled, as the Rus had doubtless planned it, in the skeins of fugitives with their bundles and their animals who were streaming away, and in the time it took them, plunging and kicking and laying about them with the blunt ends of their lances, to clear a path, the remainder of the company caught up. Through the Persian eyeglass Zelikman could clearly make out, in the midst of the surging horsemen, Amram and the youth, mounted together, something stiff in Amram's carriage betraying to Zelikman's eye that his hands were probably bound, and beside them Hanukkah slouched on the back of a desert ass. There was a delay as orders were given and lamentations heard and prayers offered, and then half the company was divided in two and sent to flank the walls of the city and gain the river mouth, where even now a lone barge set out toward the long ships with the last great fistful of plunder, poled with wild discipline by a dozen red-shirted men. The remaining half of the black-armored Arsiyah dismounted to confront the barred gate. They could not know, as Zelikman saw plainly from the top of the rise, that the Rus had abandoned, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say they had perfected, their conquest of the city.The troopers set about scaling the towers that flanked the gate, but they could not gain a toehold in the masonry, and so they improvised a harness from rope and lashed a half-dozen horses together and set the team to work pulling at an iron hasp in the left-hand door. This proved to be futile as well, and men were sent to pile kindling at the doors' base. Then Amram leapt from the horse and held out his arms, and his bonds were cut. He took hold of the rope that still bound the horses to the gate and, with a slap on the hindquarters of the biggest animal put his own back into the effort. Zelikman could hear the singing of the rope and the low oaken moaning of the gate, followed a moment later by an echoing bang like the crack of an immense whip. The doors fell open, and with ululating cheers the riders poured into the city they had arrived at too late to save. The last Northmen were hauled along with their booty onto the only ship that had not yet set sail just as the first Arsiyah rode out onto the burning wharfs, which collapsed under the weight of their horses and armor, throwing up a spectacular cloud of vapor and sparks.Zelikman lowered the eyeglass, returned it to its doeskin pouch and then summoned Hillel and drove him at a gallop down to the town. The Arsiyah had seen him only by moonlight, with his hat lowered and his cloak flying, and at any rate if prior circumstance had inclined them to view him as an enemy through soldierly habit and because of his undeniable theft of the horse they had stolen from those who had stolen it from Zelikman, who had stolen it from a thief, he was needed, now, with his salves and his ointments and his willingness to stoop to the lowly work of the surgeon.In the first group of refugees he fell among he found a dozen burned, punctured, battered and maimed, bleeding from raw and tumultuous wounds. Rumor of the miraculous advent of a white-skinned barber soon traveled all the way to the mouth of the river and back, so that to ride the seven rods that lay between him and the city gates required the remainder of the daylight, the better part of his pharmakon and his entire stock of fine silken thread.He entered the city caked in blood, hungry and hollowed out, having vomited twice in the course of the day in reaction to the odors emitted by particularly vile wounds, his eyes stung by smoke, the wailing of babies haunting his ears. He sat his horse, hardly aware of the crackling fires, the barren doorsteps and the empty holes of housefronts, the carrion birds, the soldiers who gaped at him as he passed, trusting Hillel to search out and choose the street or alley that would lead to Amram. They passed into a narrow defile flanked by high houses that reached out for one another as they rose overhead until they were parted only by a cool dark band of twilight. The horse's shoeless hooves struck the paving stones with a knock like iron on bones, and then they emerged into a broad square, nearly as spacious as the piazza at Ravenna, and there on the wide steps of the despoiled mosque, one of whose minarets stood blackened and frail as a burned-out brand, with his arm around the slim shoulders of Filaq and a snoring Hanukkah curled at his feet, wearing the dice-playing smile of a man who could never be surprised, sat Amram.He rose a little unsteady to his feet. His face was streaked with ash, ash lay on his hair and scalp and his eyes were crazed with pink. He came wincing down the steps of the mosque as if his back or hips were bothering him, and he and Zelikman fell into each other's arms. From within the mosque came the broken voices of men at prayer. Amram stank of burned tallow, smoke and a hard day's labor, but underneath it all there was the familiar smell of him like sun on dusty sandstone. The sound of prayer found some kind of grateful echo in Zelikman's heart.''Late as usual,'' Amram said.Next week: Filaq challenges the Arsiyah and their mission.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.</text></article><article id="1830266"><summary>Chapter 21 of Seth's comic strip George Sprott (1894-1975)</summary><text>Chapter 21THE FUNNY PAGES: I: THE STRIP</text></article><article id="1830268"><summary>Photos of up-and-coming men's-wear designers in New York and Los Angeles and their fashions</summary><text>Shawn Collins: ''I don't really know any guys who wear suits,'' Shawn Collins says. ''But I'm not 20 years old anymore, so the whole grungy thing is getting played out.'' Collins, who worked in Paris for Clements Ribeiro and John Galliano before relocating to Venice, Calif., solves the style conundrum for his fellow in-betweeners with cashmere sweaters and sport jackets that he describes as a little bit schoolboy and a little bit rock 'n' roll. ''In my mind I'm a rock star,'' he says. Which helps to explain why he chose to be photographed with the Burden, the band behind the rising star Rocco DeLuca and the first group signed to the actor Kiefer Sutherland's record label. ''Bands are always good before they break, don't you think?'' Collins says.Michael Bastian: ''It's kind of the American gift to fashion, that unstudied thing,'' says Michael Bastian, the former fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman Men. Naturally, he would appreciate preppy basics like a shrunken sweater in a washed-out shade of Nantucket red with sleeves that have grown long from ''wear'' or a good raincoat and the perfect chinos -- the kinds of clothes that happen to look great on a student like William Brobston (photographed here in Bastian's artfully frayed shorts). ''I see people who are so done, so rigged and perfectly put together, and it's like their external life is taking the place of their internal life,'' says the designer, who lives and works in a shabbily charming town house in the West Village. ''I'd almost rather someone be a little neglectful of their exterior.''Modern Amusement: John Moore, the creative director of Modern Amusement, might wear board shorts to his sleek design studio blocks from the Santa Monica beach, but you'd be surprised how much vigilance it takes to design clothes that are just the right side of unpolished. Moore, who helped conceive the California-inspired Hollister brand for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, gets his inspiration from guys like Mike Piscitelli, a video director, zine editor, record-label head and photographer, who, with a professional skateboarder, owns a clothing line. (The two have even competed to see who can grow the unrulier beard.) ''It's the sophisticated teenager all the way up to the adult that's afraid of growing up,'' Moore says of the brand's target audience. ''Mike's in the middle of that. He represents everything we like.''Nicholas K: If for many New Yorkers an occasional respite from the city is a luxury, for Nicole Kunz it's ''work.'' Kunz has the polish of a graduate of the corporate fashion establishment -- DKNY, Nautica, Calvin Klein -- plus she loves to fly-fish. At her Midtown studio, amid the rumpled henleys and deconstructed safari jackets, you can also find a box of flies, hand-tied by her fisherman boyfriend for her brother Chris, who is the muse behind her rugged and refined Nicholas K men's-wear collection. Chris, who has been known to read hunting magazines on the subway, is also her fit model and her business partner. (How many designers who borrow from the outdoorsman's wardrobe can claim such a close relationship to their references?) ''We're able to balance our hobbies and our work,'' she says.Free City: In Los Angeles, where status can assume the casual posture of anti-status, Free City offers it up pure. The T-shirts, sweatshirts and flight pants at its Malibu Supershop are hand-printed with mantras like ''Life Nature Love'' or naturalist symbols like a hummingbird. ''I'm a total hippie,'' says Nina Garduno, Free City's guru. ''I wear thongs in the winter in Europe. With socks.'' Garduno is also a vice president of the L.A.-based retailer Ron Herman, where for 25 years she has presided over one of the world's best men's-wear departments. ''I'm creating for all people,'' she says, explaining why she chose to be photographed solo. But she has no illusions about providing for a privileged bohemia. ''If somebody is saving up to buy my $100 T-shirt, I say it's worth it. They're getting something real.''Engineered Garments: The name for Daiki Suzuki's men's-wear line came, appropriately enough, from one of his pattern makers. Impressed by the meticulousness of the plans for his first collection, she commented that the garments were not so much designed as engineered. Suzuki finds the complications that result from his obsession with American military uniforms, work wear and sporting apparel to be a pleasure. (Fortunately, so does his business associate Tokuro Aoyagi.) For him, there is Old World romance in personally overseeing the manufacturing process, which is one of the reasons that he, like the artist Ross Menuez, whose work he sells in his stores in Japan, appreciates New York's garment center. ''There's a pretty good chance that I've touched each garment,'' Suzuki says. ''I love it.''Band of Outsiders: Before he started his line, Band of Outsiders, Scott Sternberg worked in the marketing department at Creative Artists Agency, responsible for things like touring with recording artists on behalf of soft-drink brands. ''Not to be too pat, but I was certainly an outsider in that world,'' he says, a sentiment that he says he shares with the indie actor Max Minghella. And apparently, they're not alone. Sternberg's retrofitted Ivy League shirts and ties have struck an instant chord with power players who relate to the designer's malcontent cool. ''I take elements of American sportswear that are personal to me and put them in a different context every season,'' he says, citing Brooks Brothers' boys' department circa 1973. ''The subversion is more about how they fit and how they fit into a wardrobe.''Tim Hamilton: When Tim Hamilton made his very first sales call -- at none other than Bergdorf Goodman -- he had no completed garments to show. But based on prototypes, sketches and a scrapbook of references that suggested high-end reinterpretations of classic American sportswear, the store placed an order, secured the exclusive rights to sell the line uptown and offered him a launch party. ''I had no idea I would be getting this much attention,'' says Hamilton, who has worked at Ralph Lauren, the Gap and J. Crew. His success so far seems to reflect the continuing demand for traditionalism, but if his choice to be photographed with the darkly contemplative painter Van Hanos is any indication, Hamilton won't be doing the strictly preppy thing for long.</text></article><article id="1830273"><summary>William Safire column on various meanings of words 'sucker' and 'suck' (M)</summary><text>''I would suggest moving back,'' said President Bush, from the cab of a yellow Caterpillar tractor at the company's East Peoria, Ill., plant. ''I'm about to crank this sucker up.'' He started the engine, watched a puff of smoke belch from the stack, steered the machine around the assembly line and announced, ''That was fun,'' as he got off.The local press caught the carefully staged symbolism of a dynamic economy and global demand for American construction equipment, not to mention more well-paying jobs thanks to a free-trade policy. But the message that got through to language mavens around the English-speaking world was that another new meaning had been accepted, at the highest level of government, in the saga of a great old English word.All of us who cavorted at the bee's-knees speak-easies in the 1920s, swilling bathtub gin and waving feather boas to the tune of the ''Charleston,'' fondly recall the image of Mary Louise (Texas) Guinan perched atop a stool in the middle of the El Fay Club in Manhattan, greeting every wide-eyed ''big butter-and-egg man'' from out of town with her trademark shout, ''Hello, sucker!''That roughly affectionate use of sucker was derived from its meaning of ''simpleton; a gullible mark often fooled, hoodwinked, swindled or otherwise easily taken advantage of.'' The metaphoric source, the Oxford English Dictionary informs us, is that of a young mammal before it is weaned from its mother's teat, calling to mind a picture of a suckling pig. The great lexicon's earliest citation in this sense is from an 1838 Toronto Patriot: ''It's true that pigs has their troubles like humans ... constables catches 'em, dogs bite 'em, and pigs is sometimes as done-over suckers as men.''That sense of gullibility was exemplified in several famous American sayings, like ''Never give a sucker an even break,'' falsely ascribed in the 1880s to the showman Phineas T. Barnum by a rival impresario. The Barnum biographer A. H. Saxton credits Paper Collar Joe Bessimer, a notorious confidence man, with ''There's a sucker born every minute, but none of them ever die.'' To be fair, the bumptious Barnum never claimed coinage; indeed, according to the Columbia World of Quotations, he later thanked his envious rival for the publicity. (P. T. Barnum is legendarily remembered for suckering his circus customers with a sly exit sign, ''This way to the egress,'' which enticed paying visitors to leave a crowded tent in the hope of seeing a live egress, presumably a caged female eager.)Paper Collar Joe's born-every-minute aphorism lives: in a segment about outlandish gifts on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' Diane Sawyer recently admitted buying a ''Memory Pillo,'' confessing, ''Because if there's a sucker born every minute, I'm the sucker born in my minute.'' In the 1936 film ''Poppy,'' W. C. Fields first said, ''Never give a sucker an even break,'' which reinforced the sense of a sucker being a born ''loser.''Other senses of the word live on inside longer locutions: vampires, always a popular attraction in horror movies, are bloodsuckers, and media pundits, proliferating madly in the blogosphere, present their views in what we like to call thumbsuckers.Even so, many feel slightly uncomfortable using the verb suck or a noun built on it. In a column about teenage slang a few years back, I reported that the term being used to describe what we used to call soul-kissing, or French kissing -- a pleasurable form of osculation, if somewhat sloppy -- is now sucking face. Some readers found that phrase to be unsuitably descriptive, even odious, and urged that its users be banished to tonsil-hockey's penalty box. The same adult distaste is shown toward such innocent childlike derogations as ''Algebra sucks.''I ran this hidden concern past Grant Barrett, editor of Oxford's excellent political etymology, ''Hatchet Jobs and Hardball,'' a host of the KPBS public-radio show ''A Way With Words'' and whose ''Double-Tongued Dictionary'' is available at www.doubletongued.org. ''While it is debated regularly,'' he e-mails, ''some linguists and lexicographers do think that sucks, as it is currently used, such as 'Algebra sucks,' without a direct object, is probably not derived from longer forms.'' Obviously, other language scholars disagree and are free to send their always profound comments to one another on the American Dialect Society listserv because I must use my remaining space to deal with this question: Is there anything unduly suggestive or remotely lascivious about Bush's ''I'm about to crank this sucker up?''Not to anyone with clean hands and a pure heart. Here is Harry Smith, paragon of media virtue, on the CBS ''Early Show,'' displaying a large, expensive toy named PlayStation 3: ''We're going to show you how this sucker works.'' And here is Representative Phil Gingrey, Georgia Republican and a stalwart of the right, on a Democratic bill ordering Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices: ''It's a loss for our seniors; we need to kill this sucker dead.'' And reaching back to 1969, John Denver's rendition of the romantic lyrics ''You dun stomped on my heart and mashed that sucker flat.''Sol Steinmetz, member of Olbom (On Language's Board of Octogenarian Mentors), is the voice of calm sagacity: ''Sucker in this context is a slang term that uses the standard word sucker for any unspecified thing, and is synonymous with other terms like dojigger, bugger, gizmo and others for 'a machine or contraption.'

After 24 years, the jobs dried up, and my two kids were away in college. Whenever I called them, they were I.M.-ing their friends, doing homework or watching a movie. They seemed irritated by whatever I did or said, including ''Good morning.'' When I had dinner with my son, a computer-science major who is on the snowboard team and flies a plane, he would arrive late and leave quickly. Teaching a college class one day a week, I was at loose ends the rest of the time. Should I volunteer? Read the classics? Call up friends of friends?I finally decided to sign up for the masters' race team at my local ski area because of the conviction that when it's a damp, drizzly November in the soul, the best tonic is to learn a new skill. (''Master'' is the politically correct word for ''older.'') Although I'd skied since my teens, I'd never raced, so on the first day of training, I discovered that everything I knew and all the gear I owned were wrong. I was wearing a teal one-piece Jean-Claude Killy suit I'd bought on sale in Aspen, but the team members present -- 10 men and one woman who ranged from 38 to 80 -- called it ''a green body bag.'' They wore skin-tight racing suits with loud spider-web patterns, just as Olympic racers do -- except the masters tend to have masters' bodies. They told me my boots were inadequate and my skis were hopeless. The lone woman, Marcy, who a few months later would fall on the snow and break her pelvis, offered to give me her old helmet.There was no problem keeping up with the team when we skied down the mountain, but when we entered the slalom course, I started skidding and slowing. For years I'd been trying to stand up tall and be graceful, but the racers assumed an aggressive crouch, pushing hard to get their skis on edge and their bodies forward. We watched a video of Bode Miller, and his skis were almost vertical, cutting like knives across the snow. I had no idea how to do that.Marcy and her husband, Bob, were the only racers who talked to me during the first weeks. Most of the men competed when they were younger and treated me like a tag-along they wanted to ditch. But I loved the slalom training: it was a blessed relief from thinking. For three hours, all I focused on was: weight on left, weight on right, here's the next turn and get forward, forward! I didn't feel I was making much progress, but by the end of the season, my coaches told me I was ready for a race.On race day, I put on a bib with the number 69 and started to get anxious. You're not allowed to take a practice run to check out the gates; you get one shot. I skied down the course more cautiously than I'd hoped, and the announcer said: ''Sara Davidson from our Masters Race Team. Good time, Sara!'' What was he talking about? I clocked the slowest time of all my teammates, but at the awards ceremony they handed me a gold medal. I came in first in my age group (56 to 65) because I was the only woman in it. This qualified me to ski in the finals, and I drove to Keystone, Colo., for the event. When they called my class, there were a dozen women in my group, and I came in last. But my coaches said, ''Next season, you've got a shot at making the podium.''Three years have passed, and I have not made the podium, but every day that I train, flying downhill on freshly packed snow never fails to boost my mood. And there are other benefits. After my first season I took my two kids and a few of their friends to Vail. I taught my son to ski when he was 5, holding him between my legs as we coasted down the bunny slope. By 12 he didn't want to ski with me anymore. He'd stand at the bottom of the lift looking frustrated. ''What took you so long?!''At Vail, he strapped on a snowboard, and on the first run I beat him down to the chairlift. Because I'd been the worst on my team and could never close the gap, I'd assumed I was not improving much.''Have you noticed anything different about my skiing?'' I asked.He nodded and said under his breath, ''Remarkable.''That night, my son announced he was going to ski the next day because skis were faster than boards, implying there was no way in hell I would beat him.The next morning my son and I, both on skis, started at one end of the resort and worked our way up and down three mountains to the other end of Vail without stopping except to have lunch. I did not beat him, but he had to work hard to stay in front. When he drove our group home that night, he was still pumped, cheeks flushed. ''I hate to admit it,'' he told the other kids, ''but I really enjoyed skiing with Mom.''Lives Sara Davidson is the author of ''Leap!

It was strange because we've got snow two hours north of Phoenix, similar to what we could get in Chicago. But being in a desert environment and seeing a little bit of snow on the ground and the beautiful red rock of those mountains -- it was a beautiful contrast.

Insofar as culture means innovative architecture and modern art, smart urban planning that prizes pedestrian-friendly boulevards and an arm's-length attitude toward deep Spanish traditions like bullfighting, such thinking is right on the money. It was in Barcelona in the 1890s that Picasso found the artistic vanguard that propelled him to Paris and world renown. And this is where Gaud&#237; spun Art Nouveau into his own quirky architectural idiom. Today the term avant-garde still applies: to Barcelona's fusion cuisine, design-accented boutique hotels, fun-loving fashion houses and even a delicious assortment of innovative chocolatiers, all of whom cut their teeth in the Catalan capital before taking on the rest of Spain.Friday4:30 p.m.  1. Picturing Picasso  Spain's greatest 20th-century export is the subject at the Picasso Museum (Carrer de Montcada, 15-23; 34-93-256-3000; www.museupicasso.bcn.es; 6 euros, or about $8, at $1.34 to the euro), which has a rich collection of the artist's early works -- Blue Period, Rose Period, Cubism -- before he permanently settled in Paris. Set in a complex of 12th- and 13th-century Catalan palaces, the museum manages to show how the young Picasso arrived in Barcelona as a teenager in 1896 and literally found the world. One can almost hear the buildings' giant stone blocks bending to his artistic will. Later in life, he cheekily donated his brilliant riffs on perhaps the country's most cherished painting -- ''Las Meninas'' by Vel&#225;zques -- proving that even after years of self-imposed exile, Picasso couldn't get Spain out of his system.6 p.m.  2. Retail Therapy  Take a leisurely stroll from the upscale Passeig de Gr&#224;cia toward the downtown Born district, where trendy boutiques line up with the last of the old mom-and-pop shops. Despite Madrid's efforts to catch up, Barcelona arguably remains the design capital of Spain, and Vin&#231;on (Passeig de Gr&#224;cia, 96; 34-93-215-6050; www.vincon.com) is among its most revered shrines for smart and stylish house wares. You'll find everything from a flexible rubber ice tray (8.45 euros) to a sleek sleeper sofa (1,495 euros), both available in a warm shade of terracotta. As you approach sea level in el Born, look for one of the six Barcelona outposts of Xocoa (www.xocoa-bcn.com), the in chocolatier that sells ginseng energy bars with an uplifting 52 percent cacao. Wash away the guilt with a glass of crisp albari&#241;o at the cavernous wine bar Vinya del Senyor (Pla&#231;a de Santa Maria, 5; 34-93-310-3379) just opposite one of Barcelona's favorite churches and gathering spots, Santa Maria del Mar.10 p.m.  3. Search for Your Supper  Cal Pep may be the iconic place to eat in Barcelona, but its sibling, Restaurant Passad&#237;s del Pep (Pla&#231;a del Palau, 2; 34-93-310-1021; www.passadis.com) remains an under-the-radar favorite precisely because it is so hard to find: down an unmarked narrow passage (passad&#237;s in Catalan), with a brooding figure standing in its arched portal. Tell the brooding figure you have a reservation, which you should make well in advance, and he will wave you in. Once inside, you don't even have to order. Just say s&#237; when Modesto or one of the other waiters offers a glass of cava and a plate of succulent jam&#243;n Serrano. The rest -- calamari, the tiniest of fried sardines, a saut&#233; of savory noodles -- just starts showing up. Eight courses for two comes to about 100 euros with cava and a bottle of another wine.Saturday11 a.m.  4. Medieval to Modern  The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, better known as MNAC (Parc de Montju&#239;c; 34-93-622-0376; www.mnac.es; admission 8.50 euros), appears as a vast palace crowning the Montju&#239;c park. Not to be missed are the Romanesque paintings -- many exhibited in artfully made concave frames to simulate the church apses they came from. They are sculptural masterpieces in their own right. Also worthwhile are the late 19th- and early 20th-century paintings by Rusi&#241;ol, Casas and others who had a profound impact on the young Picasso and, thus, the course of modernism. Back down the hill are Mies van der Rohe's 1929 Barcelona Pavilion (Avinguda del Marqu&#232;s de Comillas, s/n; 34-93-423-4016; www.miesbcn.com) and CaixaForum (Avinguda del Marqu&#232;s de Comillas, 6-8; 34-93-476-8600; www.fundacio.lacaixa.es), a converted textile factory that houses temporary exhibitions.2 p.m.  5. Casual Tapas  Bar Mut (Carrer de Pau Claris, 192; 34-93-217-4338) is a bustling joint where local people go to feast on a casual lunch of ca&#241;as (small beers) and no-fuss tapas like herb-infused steamed mussels, toast topped with luscious duck liver and caramelized onion, and a hearty four-cheese risotto. The seemingly endless menu is written on the blackboard at the bar, and the easygoing servers never seem to be fazed no matter how many times you call them back to order something else. Lunch for two with drinks is about 40 euros.4 p.m.  6. Make a Splash  Given Barcelona's balmy Mediterranean climate, the beach is an option much of the year. And thanks to a recent cleanup, an afternoon dip no longer requires a drive out of town -- or a tetanus shot. Among the liveliest city beaches is Platja de Sant Sebasti&#224; at the end of la Barceloneta, a wedge of land jutting into the Mediterranean near the Port Vell (Old Harbor). You can moisten your insides as well with the cheap beers (2 euros) at the very chill-out Chiringuito del Mar, a beach shack where the pavement of Pla&#231;a del Mar meets the sand of Sant Sebasti&#224;.10 p.m.  7. Foam Party  After years under the tutelage of the nueva cocina star Ferran Adri&#225;, the chef Carles Abellan went solo with Comer&#231; 24 in el Born (Carrer del Comer&#231;, 24; 34-93-319-2102; www.comerc24.com). Traditional tapas and Spanish classics are deconstructed to the essential ingredients then frothed up into foams or consolidated in custards. Signature dishes include a gently poached egg bathed in a fragrant foam of potato and black truffles and served back in its shell. Try set menus like the Festival (includes seven tapas and a dessert sampler for 54 euros) or Super Festival (includes 10 tapas and cheese and dessert samplers, 72 euros).1:30 a.m.  8. Cozy Cocktails  Despite the name over the door, everyone seems to drink whiskey sours at Gimlet (Carrer del Rec, 24; 34-93-310-1027), a cozily upholstered bar packed with bohemian writers and art types. It's the perfect place to have what Spaniards call ''the first drink'' (cocktails, 6 to 8 euros), meaning a sophisticated and civilized cocktail in a respectable setting before heading off to clubs or less refined establishments. For a list of the current hot spots, pick up the weekly Gu&#237;a del Ocio (www.guiadelocio.com) for 1 euro.Sunday11 a.m.  9. Overpay for the O.J.  It's touristy, it's overpriced, and it gets away with it because everyone in town meets at Caf&#233; Zurich (Pla&#231;a de Catalunya, 1; 34-93-317-9153), which occupies the busiest corner on the busiest square in the city. Angle for a table outside for people watching or the quieter mezzanine for a t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te. The coffee (1.75 euros) is excellent, the beers (2.80) are Wagnerian in scale, and the sandwiches, or bocadillos (3.45), are just so-so -- unless you ask for a side of tomatoes and olive oil, which makes all the difference.1 p.m.  10. Above the Fray  Forget about shopping or art; much of Barcelona is shut on Sundays. Instead, head to the northern edge of the city and Parc G&#252;ell, Gaud&#237;'s bulbous and mosaic-carpeted gardens on ahill near Mont Tibidabo. The terraces and promontories offer exquisite views of the city, and Gaud&#237;'s eternal work-in-progress, la Sagrada Fam&#237;lia, looms in the middle. You can get there by public transit, but any party of more than two should jump in a taxi (about 8 euros from the Pla&#231;a de Catalunya). If you're really game, go even higher on the Ferris wheel or the Aeroplane at the Tibidabo Amusement Park (Pla&#231;a del Tibidabo, 3-4; 34-93-211-7942; www.tibidabo.es), two old-school rides that still soar above Spain's most mod city.THE BASICSContinental and Delta have flights from New York City airports with fares starting around $600 in mid-May. Beyond a 25-euro cab ride ($33.50 at $1.34 to the euro), the easiest way into the city is the blue and yellow Aerobus (3.75 euros; www.bcn.es), which shuttles every 15 minutes between the airport and the Espanya and Catalunya plazas. Barcelona has a world-class transit system (1.25 euros a ride), but also very reasonable taxis, with crosstown fares usually less than 10 euros.For top location and amenities, the year-old Hotel Granados 83 (Carrer Enric Granados, 83; 34-93-492-9670; www.derbyhotels.com) offers 77 wenge wood- and leather-clad rooms, including four duplex suites and one standard room that share a private plunge pool on a garden terrace. Others have to make do with the rooftop pool and bar. Doubles start at 270 euros.Originally built for the 1992 Summer Olympics, the 44-story Hotel Arts (Carrer de la Marina, 19-21; 34-93-221-1000; www.hotelartsbarcelona.com) recently renovated its nearly 500 rooms with chic modular furnishings in dark woods and silvery shades. In addition to its beachfront location, the hotel has a giant Frank Gehry fish sculpture, a luxe spa and an aqua-tinged restaurant by the chef Sergi Arola. Doubles from 488 euros.  36 HOURS</text></article><article id="1830294"><summary>Henry Shukman reviews Indian restaurants in London; photos (L)</summary><text>DID the Indian restaurant, with its flock wallpaper and piped sitars and tablas, its biryanis and vindaloos, save British cuisine? It was in the '60s that Indian restaurants began to proliferate, and four decades later, in 2001, Robin Cook, the foreign minister, hailed chicken tikka masala as a true national dish of Britain. Previously, there was only fancy French food out of the reach of most, and the bland boiled nursery yuck that generations of Britons had had little choice but to swill, and tell themselves they liked.India gave Britain chutney, mustard, pepper, curry and mulligatawny soup. It gave Britain flavor. It even gave us Jamie Oliver's trademark ''pukka.''I remember discovering biryanis as a teenager. They were an incredible value. Your rice and meat came mixed together, with a vegetable curry on the side -- two meals in one, in effect. And so good. So profoundly did those meals enter my psyche that even today I only have to hear sitar music and it brings on a Pavlovian salivation, with olfactory hallucinations of cumin.Britain is now as cuisine-obsessed as anywhere. Chefs are big stars. Food has become a facet of fashionable style in England. So where does this leave the traditional Indian restaurant, with its menu of rich, variously colored curries that come in mild, medium and hot, usually with a film of oil swimming on top, and its clientele that swells after 11 p.m. when the pubs close?Whatever beneficent effect Indian cuisine had on the British palate has doubled back. There's a new generation of high-end Indian restaurants that argue with plausibility that their cooking is just as sophisticated as any others, and why shouldn't they too receive Michelin stars, as four in London have, including three of the five below.To investigate this new Indian cuisine, I set off with a couple of old friends to where it all started -- a traditional hole-in-the-wall.HOT STUFFHot Stuff has been winning rapturous praise for nearly two decades, since the Dawood family opened it in 1988. It sits in a row of little shops on a side street in Lambeth, south of the river (where ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' was filmed). It's tiny -- two rows of plastic tables and chairs, a kitchen at the back with hip-hop keeping the cooks lively, and a front window decorated with frosted glass flames. The air is thick with cumin and garam masala, the blend of spices endemic to Indian cuisine.Personally, I love a place that looks worse than it is -- somewhere special in disguise. Run by Raj Dawood, son of the original owners, Hot Stuff was recently included in a Times of London Magazine survey as not only one of the best cheap restaurants in London, but one of the city's best Indian restaurants in any price range.''We do home-style cooking just like my mum did at home,'' Mr. Dawood said. If he grew up with food like this, he was a lucky kid.First, little dishes of tamarind, tomato and lime chutneys arrived, along with a bowl of papadum, the Indian restaurant's answer to chips and salsa. Various starters followed: excellent king prawns in garlic and chili, on a small dollop of tomato and onion sauce; jeera chicken wings cooked in ginger and cumin, whose flesh melted off the bone, served in a tamarind and date sauce sweetened with blocks of raw cane sugar; soft potato and spinach bhajis.Oil can be the bane of Indian meals. So can sweetness. As Mr. Dawood puts it, curries are meant to be savory not sweet, but today many Indian restaurants add fruit and nuts to satisfy the British sweet tooth. The main dishes here are clean, dry, free of the ubiquitous film of oil.We had three: lamb dopiaza, a staple of Indian restaurants, made fierce with black peppercorns, along with sweet peppers; kehrala chicken, another standard, but with not too much sauce, so you could pick out the individual flavors of the ginger, coconut and curry leaves; and king prawn masala, made with black tiger prawns, rich with onion, tomato and coriander. On the side, a dish of butternut squash with spinach, in which the bitter and sweet elements went well together; and a ''Bad Boy,'' a huge thin nan bread folding off the edge of its oversize plate.Clean, bursting with aromatic flavor, at &#163;15 a head, or $29 at $1.99 to the pound, this meal would be hard to beat.AMAYAAmazingly, this Michelin-starred ''Indian grill'' in the heart of international Sloaneland, between Knightsbridge and Belgravia, somehow did manage to beat Hot Stuff -- admittedly at three times the price.Amaya is a whole new concept in Indian. As the proprietors explain on the menu, they don't do either starters or main courses. All dishes are small, something like Indian tapas -- though the gorgeous presentation is more reminiscent of sushi.The design is more Manhattan than London, with black tables and leather chairs, dark floorboards and a glass-countered kitchen at the side, where you can see the chefs in action. Bowls filled with floating candles abound. The lavishness of a traditional Indian restaurant has been transmuted into an elegant chic.We started with interesting nonalcoholic drinks: mango lassi with mint (a traditional yogurt drink), and lime juice flavored with the exotic spice vetiver. Four little pots of spices and chutneys arrived in a neat row -- the aesthetic here favors tidy rows -- to enable you, as my companion Alice put it, to customize your own curry. Except the food here is beyond curry.Amaya is all about grilling. First we had rock oysters on the half shell, flash-grilled without oil on a tawa, a hot iron skillet, served in a yellow coconut sauce -- maybe the best hot oysters I've ever had -- and scallops, also on half shells, in a green herb sauce. Both were superb, and made me wonder why I'd never had seafood cooked with these cogent spices before.Next, sweet corn and sweet potato kebabs, skewered and fired in the clay tandoori oven -- something like mini-tamales, resting on a square of banana leaf. The sequence of small dishes offered many opportunities for attractive presentation.Chunks of monkfish followed -- fish tikka -- cooked with fenugreek and leaf turmeric in the tandoor. The nuances of the spices were noticeably more delicate than in a traditional Indian place. King prawns arrived dark and spicy with chili paste, followed by grouper on bamboo sticks cooked on the sigri, a charcoal grill, and wrapped in pandanus leaf. We next tried the black peppercorn chicken tikka, succulent, tender, spicy, with a dab of peanut sauce on the side to counterbalance the fierce dry flavor of the black pepper, and chicken chops, flayed chicken wings smoky with charcoal.The whole meal was delicate, subtle, aromatic -- something like the best barbecue you ever had. With its friendly and highly informative staff, Amaya was well worth the high ticket.TAMARINDThe brainchild of the chef Atul Kochhar, Tamarind was one of the first Indian restaurants in London to win a Michelin star, in 2001 (which it has retained despite Mr. Kochhar's moving on). It has a welcome station at the door, beyond which stairs take you down to the spacious yet intimate dining room, decorated with distressed mirrors and tended by a large staff in black tunics. A half-silvered two-way mirror allows you to catch shadowy glimpses of the chefs' gestures in the kitchen.The meal began with an amuse-bouche of vegetable soup in an espresso cup, then a plate of chutneys -- green apple; tart, dark berry; and tomato and cardamom -- with a basket of papadum. Our first courses were wonderful grilled scallops on a bed of tomato, black pepper and cumin, and a rather tart tamarind salad of firm plums, kumquats and green leaves.The main dishes were tandoori grilled monkfish with a little dish of mint and yogurt sauce on the side -- tender and just a little chewy, with a hint of earthy smokiness from the tandoor -- and perfectly grilled sea bass fillets over a bed of crispy spinach, flavored with coconut and garlic. On the side, saut&#233;ed mixed vegetables -- French beans, spinach, baby corn, asparagus, cauliflower, peas -- and mushrooms in creamy tomato sauce with cumin, ginger and chili was a traditional Indian sauce to be sure, but subtle and compelling.For dessert, a mango cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e and big chunks of tandoor-grilled pineapple that had first been marinated in saffron, which subdued its sweetness, and appealingly caramelized at the corners, served with rose petal ice cream. Finally, petits fours of frozen mint leaves dipped in white chocolate, and chestnut pieces coated in strong dark chocolate, closed an excellent and not too heavy meal. We left with none of that old feeling of heaving oneself from an Indian table laden with unparalleled doses of grease.ZAIKAMichelin stars are big business. Chefs jostle and hustle and strive for them, are made and broken by them. Vineet Bhatia won one at Zaika the same year Tamarind did, and after moving on to his own place, Rasoi, he has finally gained one there too after some mixed responses. Meanwhile, Zaika actually lost its star a year ago, but for many it remains a restaurant justifying its prices.It occupies a large old bank in Kensington, with giant stone-mullioned windows and an eye-catching modern iron chandelier somewhat like a tractor tire -- or, as my poet friend Hamish accompanying me suggested, a massive air filter.Again an amuse-bouche arrived in an espresso cup: this time, wild mushroom broth, slightly spicy with cumin and green chili, with a lid on which a tiny chicken pakora perched -- deep-fried with a mint and coriander sauce. Highly promising.Having ordered the tasting menu (six courses for &#163;38), we started with scallops -- two seared wonderfully with sesame and onion seeds, and two poached with lime leaves, served with spicy mashed potato. Then came three chunks of sublime tandoori salmon, half-roasted, half-smoked in the tandoor (a little like bradan rost but much more succulent), after marinating in mustard and honey. A trio of chicken tikkas fired in three kinds of marinade followed -- green herb, masala cheese and peppercorns, and pomegranate seeds, the last two strong and delicate at once.Next came an ingenious combination: foie gras served on a mushroom and truffle nan bread, with mango chutney. The whole was rich and smooth, and argued convincingly that French and Indian cuisine can be happily married. Innovative and exquisite, it got me thinking that two things have elevated Indian cuisine: the pulling back on sauces so just the spices remain, and the huge expansion of varieties of protein.Then came that uplifting moment beloved of diners in fancy restaurants, when there are suddenly three people at your table, because in the theater of food presentation the main players are about to enter. Particularly good were the coconut shrimp in orange sauce with lime leaves, and the rare masala duck breast over black lentils with celeriac and parsnip mash. Duck with garam masala spices? The meeting of the P&#233;rigord and the Ganges was again inspired.BENARESFancy restaurants are always part theater, but some are more so. At Benares, Mr. Kochhar's new venture -- with his being a TV star and the tabs at a level to preclude all but bankers and soccer players -- the theatrical element is high. Perhaps that helped it win its first Michelin star this year.A stone-clad foyer leads up a grand stairway to the restaurant itself, awash with pools with flowers floating on them. I have to admit I couldn't suppress a nostalgic twinge for the plastic seats of Hot Stuff as I was encouraged into my leather banquette.The menu opened with a gush of prose about the holy city of Benares, a place of particular spirituality, but isn't there something just a little off about allying any kind of spirituality with such brazen conspicuous consumption? I must be a Puritan at heart.The John Dory over Jerusalem artichokes was exceptional, and the starter of soft-shell crab with crispy fried squid and passion fruit over slices of blue Peruvian potato was imaginative, tender, stunning. This was by any account a great meal.Yet by the time I left, I couldn't help feeling just a little fleeced. The mostly young staff was overattentive and underinformed, and seemed to have half an eye on the door not to miss a celebrity's entrance. And the bill was monstrous (over &#163;200 for two). While the chicken tikka masala that we were urged to try may have been as good as the dish gets, it was still the old chicken submerged in a bowl of sauce.And come to think of it, something else was missing, too. Something that has been missing from all these meals: the music, the resonant tablas and whining sitars inseparable from Indian food. I hadn't heard it all week.Did I miss it? Well, if I did, I could always go down to the local curry house. At one-fifth, or even one-tenth of these prices, it'll be there a good while yet, I suspect.BILL OF FAREPrices are per person, without wine or tip.Hot Stuff, 19 Wilcox Road, SW8; (44-20) 7720-1480; www.eathotstuff.com; &#163;10 to &#163;15, about $20 to $30 at $1.99 to the pound.

Soon it began to snow, and they flipped onto their backs and strained to catch the chubby flakes in their mouths like so much candy.I had been communing with the landscape around our Finnish spa a bit differently. Earlier indoors, a muscular woman named Sari had poured a bucket of hot mud scooped from a nearby lake over me and swaddled me in a plastic sheet for half an hour, making me resemble a piece of performance art.Hard to say who enjoyed it more: me, luxuriating in all that ooze, which Sari promised would cause me ''to go to the bathroom several times today and sleep very well tonight.'' Or my three kids, who could not stop giggling at the mess that their dad had gotten himself into.If you have mused about escaping to a spa -- massages and manicures, saunas and soaks, Champagne facials and Champagne brunches -- then the idea of towing along your young dependents has most likely made you blanch. It is not easy relaxing while worrying whether your son is slathering crayon on the divan in the sun lounge. And who wants to pay for the kind of coddling that children might hardly appreciate?But on the southwestern Finnish coast, two and a half hours by train and car from Helsinki, we found something of a compromise at a resort where my wife, Julie Dressner, and I could sample Nordic spa culture while keeping the kids engaged and happy. The Naantali Spa Hotel (358-2-44-550; www.naantalispa.fi/english) is certainly not a destination devoted to family vacations, and at times we feared that our children were disturbing its relatively understated atmosphere. At least while we were there, a significant number of the guests were elderly people, who padded around in white terry-cloth bathrobes.Still, the English-speaking staff seemed always eager to accommodate us, and the spa's complex of pools and hot tubs delighted the children. They spent hours at a time there, allowing Julie and me to trade off while we exercised, used the saunas, sampled some of the treatments or just plain read. In the rare instances when they became bored, they went to the children's room, which had toys, art projects and a television.I must admit that I am no spa expert, and was more amused than tantalized by many of what the spa refers to as ''therapies.'' A bath in milk and honey (34 euros, around $46 at $1.34 to the euro)? A gentle rub with heated stones and oil (58 euros)? I passed on a lot of those.But there were all varieties of massages -- a fellow named Teppo gave me an excellent one (46 euros) -- and the pool complex offered us ample opportunity to explore the Nordic ritual of subjecting yourself to successive temperature contrasts. A stint in the sauna, a swim in a cool indoor pool, then into the hot tub. Repeat three times. Nap.And then there was the quintessentially Nordic outdoor pool. To get there, you swim through a passageway from an indoor pool, and once outside, you feel as intrepid as one of those crazed Finns or Russians who cut holes in the ice to go for a dip. In reality, the outdoor water at the spa is balmy, so when your face or extremities start to chill, you dive down and warm up. The children sometimes scampered from the pool and did a barefoot gig in the snow before plunging back in.A key to our visit was that we did not stay at the hotel itself, but rather in a modest brick building across the road that the spa operates, called the family hostel.Our room there was spare, with few of the luxuries of the hotel itself: no maid service or cable television or minibar. But at 90 euros a night, it was cheaper than a room at the hotel itself (156 euros or more), and it had two small bedrooms and a living room with a decent kitchen. A good supermarket was only a 10-minute walk away.WE were able to bring the children to the room after a long day of swimming, give them a bowl of pasta and put them to bed. No fretting about finicky eaters or crankiness at the spa's restaurants. (I was reminded why I like access to kitchens on vacations when we went to the spa's expansive dinner buffet one night. My son, who was 4 at the time, surveyed the trays of roast beef and smoked fish and other dishes and showed up at the table with a plate that contained a total of four crackers.)The hotel itself is attractive though not especially striking -- Julie referred to it as conference center-chic. It is, though, strikingly clean. We first noticed the Finnish passion for hygiene while traveling from Helsinki on the train, which offers rows of plastic bags for passengers' garbage. Not a bad idea for the New York City subway system.Naantali is one of the country's leading vacation spots in summer, and if you visit the spa at that time, you may feel compelled to steer clear of some of its indoor attractions in order to spend more time on outdoor ones, like hikes, sailing and aquatics. Nearby is Moominworld, an amusement park inspired by a popular series of Finnish children's stories by Tove Jansson, but it is open only from mid-June through mid-August.In the off-season, when we were there, Naantali is largely dormant, but the nearby city of Turku, 20 minutes away by bus, is not. A one-day TurkuCard (40 euros) gave us free entrance to many attractions, and we started at Aboa Vetus &amp; Ars Nova, a museum that is on the site of an excavation of medieval Turku and features ruins from the time and exhibits, as well as a separate section with modern art.The children were even more taken by another medieval site, the enormous stone Turku Castle, a museum with cavernous rooms, labyrinthine corridors and spooky charm. English-speaking guides provided an engaging history of the castle, though, alas, I suspect that the children's favorite part of the tour was seeing a carved stone toilet through which a prisoner supposedly slithered to freedom.Staying in the family hostel across the street made us at times feel a bit like the spa's stepchildren, especially because we had to bundle up to return to our room from the spa, but the hotel guests did not.At the end of the week, we spent a night at one of the spa's main attractions, a replica of a large yacht with 140 rooms moored on the bay next to the main hotel and connected by an indoor passageway. Our room was luxurious but cramped, especially the small bathroom. I cannot imagine spending the week there with three children.Though perhaps if all five of us had tried a few more spa treatments, we would have been so relaxed that we could have tolerated even an extended stay in a cruise ship room.One thing's for sure: whether or not you believe in the benefits of being plastered in Naantali lake mud or the like (and I'll spare you the details about its effects on my digestive system), don't underestimate its entertainment value for the whole family. As my wife said, ''It was worth it just for the photo of you.''HEADS UP | FINLAND</text></article><article id="1830296"><summary>Ken Belson travel article on day trip to Mount Takao outside Tokyo, Japan; photo; map (M)</summary><text>TOKYO'S reputation as an endless urban jungle is well earned. The concrete buildings, the chaotic narrow streets and scarcity of parks can tire even the most citified. Which is why visitors in the central city are often surprised to learn that an hour to the west by train, Tokyo is filled with mountains, streams and vistas that evoke Portland, Ore., or Boulder, Colo.A day trip to the Tama region, which stretches toward Mount Fuji, provides a chance to enjoy fresh air, exercise and flora. It is also a pleasant counterpoint to the metropolitan excess that tourists typically see when they visit Japan for only a few days.For those with only a day to spare, Mount Takao, the city's most prominent mountain, is a logical destination. There are more ambitious outings in Tokyo, but Takao has the virtue of being accessible enough that you can pack several activities into one day without emptying your wallet, something easily done by staying in town. In March and April, Takao is a great place to take in the plum and cherry blossoms that breathe life back into the city after a chilly winter; in mid-March, a fire-walking festival has revelers walking barefoot on hot embers. One of the city's more elegant and evocative restaurants, Ukai Toriyama, nestled in a small valley near the foot of the mountain, also draws day-trippers. Diners sit in huts with thatched roofs and are doted on by kimono-clad waitresses who provide hot coals to prepare sumptuous robatayaki, or grilled, lunch or dinner.As with so many things in Japan, timing is everything, though. Since Takao is mobbed on weekends and holidays, especially in the spring, consider visiting during the week. And leave the city by 10 a.m. so you have time to hike and eat a leisurely lunch or vice versa.For visitors staying in central Tokyo, the easiest way to get to Takao is from the Keio train terminal on the west side of Shinjuku Station. Tickets to the end of the line, Takao-san Guchi Station, cost 370 yen (about $3.10 at 124 yen to the U.S. dollar) and can be bought near the ticket gates. You can save up to 20 percent by buying a round-trip ticket that includes rides on the cable car up Takao. (www.keio.co.jp/english/multiple/multiple3.html; 81-42-337-3222)Since there is no difference in fare, you may as well take an express train with an orange, blue or green sign in front. They leave about every 20 minutes from Platform 3.During the first part of the roughly 50-minute ride to Takao-san Guchi, the train whizzes past nearly indistinguishable neighborhoods. But by the midway point, the city gives way slightly and, on a clear day, the foothills to the west come into view.From Takao-san Guchi Station, you can head straight for the hills, stop for a light lunch at a restaurant on the shopping street to the right or take a minibus operated by Ukai Toriyama to the restaurant for a fuller meal.But if you have arrived early enough, try tackling Takao first. Only about 2,000 feet high, its main numbered trails are roughly two miles long and while steep in parts, include numerous chances to rest on the way, as well as sneak peeks at Mount Fuji and the surrounding mountains. The Mount Inari Path is one of the longer ones, but less crowded, and includes beautiful spring or fall foliage.Less ambitious hikers, or travelers in a rush, can ride the cable car or chair lift that takes passengers about halfway to the peak. Cars leave about every 15 minutes from Kiyotaki Station and Sanroku Station (for the chair lift), which are a three-minute walk from the train. The cars and lift operate from 8 a.m. until late afternoon or early evening depending on the season; one-way tickets for adults cost 470 yen, or 900 yen for a round trip (Takao Tozan Dentetsu; 81-42-661-4151). The five-minute ride in the cable car has a pitch of 31 degrees, one of the steepest rides of its kind in Japan.After alighting, visit the monkey park on the mountain's south slope (400 yen for adults, 200 yen for children; 81-42-661-2381). Here, there are dozens of Japanese monkeys as well as guides who can explain how they socialize. Or start marching up through the forest thick with oak and evergreen trees. Trail No. 1 is quite scenic as you pass through Joshin Gate, past maples and cedars, to Yakuoin Temple, about 20 minutes from the cable car. Built in 744 to commemorate the Buddhist saint Gyoki, the graceful yet imposing temple is dedicated to the Buddha of healing, and its waters are used by worshipers in their meditations.The peak is often crowded with picnickers and photo buffs, and understandably so. On clear days, central Tokyo to the east seems to levitate in the distance, while the mountains to the west give a taste of Japan's rugged interior and the majestic Mount Fuji.Descending on trail No. 6, you pass Biwa-taki, a delightful waterfall.When you return to the train station, stop at one of the several soba shops near the station. Takahashi-ya, a two-minute walk from the station, offers filling dishes at reasonable prices.If your budget, schedule and stomach allow, call ahead for a reservation at Ukai Toriyama (81-426-61-0739).The minibus from the restaurant picks up diners at the train station three times an hour. After a short drive, you are whisked to a private or semiprivate room. Then things slow down. Sitting on tatami mats, you'll hear the sounds of babbling streams, chirping birds and rustling bamboo.The waiters and waitresses then appear and, in hushed tones, bring the moist towels called oshibori and then hearths filled with hot coals. A round of beers is a good way to start, followed by sake served in bamboo stalks. The specialty of the house is free-range chicken and is included on most of the set menus, which start at 4,730 yen (not including drinks and tax). The course that substitutes beef for chicken costs 8,930 yen.The elaborate kaiseki meals start with a few seasonal appetizers. This past spring, lunches included grilled takenoko, or young bamboo, from Kyushu, and a large hamaguri, or clam, that was heated on the hearth. That was followed with small slices of raw chicken with a savory sesame sauce. Despite health concerns that we have here in the United States, tori-sashi is considered safe and delectable at places like Ukai Toriyama that get regular supplies of fresh chicken. The squeamish, of course, could skip to the clear broth with quail meatballs that came next.The service was unobtrusive, yet so well timed that each dish could be enjoyed before a new treat arrived. The next round, accompanied by a fresh order of sake, included skewers of negi (scallion), shiitake mushrooms and big chunks of chicken, which we grilled ourselves.Another round of skewers arrived, this time with iwana, a small river fish that was already roasted. The entire fish is edible except for the head, which had sharp edges.The meal was rounded out with miso soup, pickles and a bowl of barley and rice with sticky mountain potato, a staple at dinner tables around Japan. Diners will insist they are full until the dessert arrives: grape sherbet on shards of ice, accompanied by green tea.The meal and peaceful surroundings are enough to lull you to sleep, but consider strolling through the garden behind the restaurant, particularly on a moonlit evening when the fireflies are out, before taking the minibus back to the station, and the train back to the big city.DAY OUT | TOKYO</text></article><article id="1830298"><summary>Christopher Solomon reviews the Cottages, expansion of Hotel Park City in Park City, Utah; photo (M)</summary><text>THE BASICSIn the last six years the Park City area has exploded with new shops, restaurants and spec mansions catering to a crowd with deep pockets in their ski parkas. Witness the 54-suite Hotel Park City, which opened in January 2003 as Utah's only member of the Leading Hotels of the World luxury marketing group. In mid-December the hotel opened the Cottages -- 46 more suites in 10 buildings 75 to 100 yards from the main lodge. As with many New West lodges the hotel aims for a ''Legends of the Fall'' feel, by way of Ralph Lauren: Persian rugs over plank floors, but with black-suited employees talking into their lapels as they hurry to retrieve your skis.LOCATIONThe cottages sit amid the 12th through 14th fairways of the public Park City Golf Club. In winter the course is transformed into 12 miles of Nordic ski trails, with skiers kicking and gliding past the cottages' big windows in the pinking dusk. It's 1.3 miles to the first restaurants and shops of the Victorian Main Street (the hotel has frequent shuttles), and about 130 yards to the new Silver Star lift at Park City Mountain Resort.THE SCENEAs one of the city's toniest addresses, the hotel sees everyone from Fortune 500 C.E.O.'s, to families to honeymooners to stars dropping in for Sundance.THE ROOMSThe Cottages are divided into condolike units that can sleep up to six, depending on the cottage. My $600 Cottage deluxe executive suite (No. 471) could sleep four, if a leather sofa bed was pressed into service. The suite was dressed in a Zane Grey palette of flint, saddle and ponderosa red, with three gas fireplaces, including one on the deck by the hot tub. Built to sell, the suites have a small but complete kitchen with washer-dryer. There are two flat-screen TVs with a Bose Surround Sound system in the living room, DVD player and limited satellite TV (though you'd think for this price a guest could catch ''The Daily Show''). Sleep can be elusive at 7,000 feet, but the king-size bed with Ralph Lauren sheets and a feather mattress delivered a deep, solid rest.AMENITIESA spa with a sound track of requisite American Indian flute music offers a full menu of body polishes and massages and has a steam bath, heated outdoor pool, hot tub and about 30 pieces of exercise equipment that are free for guests' use. There are two restaurants, the Sleigh (fine dining) and Bandanas Bar &amp; Grill (wings and burgers), and free in-room Internet. There are some minor glitches, however, that guests shouldn't expect at this level: One front-desk employee told me I couldn't use a spa locker to change before swimming, without paying (untrue). And when I called for a shuttle to go out for dinner, it had left by the time I walked directly to the lobby.BATHROOMSThe bathroom has granite countertops, slate floors and sandstone bathing areas. There are a deep soaking jet tub, separate glass shower stall (with three different shower heads) and Bulgari amenities.ROOM SERVICEBreakfast -- huevos rancheros and orange juice -- arrived six minutes past the requested time. Cost for one: $24.74, including the $3 room-service charge and 20 percent service charge. It wasn't smoking hot. Room service did thoughtfully call a few minutes later to check on me, though.THE BOTTOM LINEOne can often anticipate a few bumps at even top-tier hotels at American ski resorts, as they wrestle with challenges like a seasonal workforce. For the most part, the Hotel Park City indeed delivers that casually elegant experience it promises. The new Cottage suites start at $400.Hotel Park City, 2001 Park Avenue, Park City, Utah, (435) 200-2000; www.hotelparkcity.com.CHRISTOPHER SOLOMON  CHECK IN /CHECK OUT</text></article><article id="1830299"><summary>Andrew Yang travel article on Lane 248, new high-fashion shopping district in Shanghai, China; photo; map (M)</summary><text>TAIKANG ROAD, at the southern end of the French Concession area in Shanghai, does not look like a portal to the cutting edge of high fashion. A dark alleyway leads to Lane 248, a narrow street filled with, among other things, old bicycles, yam carts and clotheslines dripping with laundry.But on a recent afternoon, the floodlights from a television crew pierced the drabness to report on the opening of yet another boutique along the lane. The store, Jaooh, which sells loose-fitting, or deconstructed, clothing under its own label, had just opened the day before.''This area is quite unique and has more personality and character than many other places in Shanghai,'' said Yvonne Wang, an owner of Jaooh (Shop 47, Lane 248, Taikang Road, 86-21-6466-5385). ''There are lot of new shops, but the character of the buildings has stayed the same.''In Shanghai, where mega-developments are the norm, the small stone houses known as shikumen along Lane 248 are being lovingly restored and converted into trendy boutiques, patisseries and cafes. Since last summer, nearly two dozen shops have opened.''Every day I come here, there's something new,'' said A-Ti Dong, a recent transplant from New York City who runs Arts du Monde (Shop 43, Lane 248; 86-21-5465-7896), which sells unusual items like trench coats made from Tibetan fabric (2,500 yuan, about $316 at 7.9 yuan to the dollar), and vintage Christian Dior Mary Jane high-heeled shoes (3,500 yuan).The ''shopification'' of Lane 248 has been spurred largely by young entrepreneurs from cosmopolitan cities like Taipei and Hong Kong. Some jokingly refer to their budding district as Lao Tian Di (Old Sky Earth), a riff on a popular entertainment district in Shanghai known as Xintiandi (New Sky Earth) that features immaculately restored shikumen houses -- and a Starbucks.But unlike that master-planned entertainment district, Lane 248 is a community with deep roots. ''There's a lot of interaction and harmony among the shopkeepers and the locals,'' said Bobbie Cornell, a New Zealand native who opened up her shop, Nuzi (Shop 30, Lane 248; 86-21-5465-3245) in November. Ms. Cornell said that her next-door neighbors, longtime residents of the lane, welcomed her to the area by offering her a number of home-cooked meals.Nuzi sells New Zealand-inspired furniture and accessories like an ash and birch loveseat by the designer David Trubridge (35,000 yuan) and large-scale prints by the artist Brent Wong (about 600 yuan).For a Zen-like break between shops, stop by Meshi (Shop 37, Lane 248; 86-21-5465-2450), a Japanese-style teahouse that serves traditional green tea and has the feel of an old Kyoto house. The Alley Bar (Shop 33, Lane 248; 86-21-6433-3469), a tiny bar and coffee shop with a third-floor patio, was getting ready to open this week.Locals who stumble onto Lane 248 don't always appreciate its appeal. ''My producer thinks it's strange,'' said Huo Yi-Lin, a film editor working on a documentary about Lane 248. ''They are such poor quality houses. But foreigners really love them, and think they are emblematic of Shanghai.''SURFACING | SHANGHAI</text></article><article id="1830300"><summary>Foraging column on shopping for cutlery at Antica Aguzzeria del Cavallo in Bologna, Italy; photos (M)</summary><text>A stroll down Via Drapperie, Bologna's main market street, leads past vegetable stalls overflowing with exotic citrus fruits and melons, cheese shops packed with crumbling wedges of aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, salumerias densely hung with sausages -- in short, enough delicacies to make a hungry tourist pine for a sharp knife.Nearly hidden amid the fray, Antica Aguzzeria del Cavallo has what they need. Walk beyond the unlikely window display -- a mishmash of camouflage gear, mace, switchblades and axes sharing the stage with kitchen cleavers, mezzalunas and a truffle slicer -- and you'll find one of the most comprehensive cutlery shops imaginable. If it cuts, rips, tears, nicks, grates, slices, shaves or pricks and is legal to sell, they most likely have it.When Antonio Bernagozzi opened it in 1783, the shop was primarily a resource for hunters, which explains both the antique leather-sheathed daggers adorning the front wall, and those camouflage jackets (though not the canisters of mace). Here, a customer could once buy a steel hunting knife and return as needed to hone the blade before giving chase to wild boars in the nearby hills. Seven generations later, the Bernagozzi family's shop has lost the horse-powered whetstone and the courtyard it once resided in (though they still offer a knife-sharpening service), but has broadened its collection of kitchen tools.On a recent Saturday, cooks clearly outnumbered hunters. In one corner, a pair of white-haired women compared handmade fluted pasta wheels (15 to 60 euros, $20 to $80 at $1.34 to the euro). Nearby, a young couple craned their necks to take in the modern and outdated implements lining the walls, perhaps wondering if the store still sells straight-edge razors (yes), and debating the merits of that mandoline.Meanwhile, sales clerks were doing brisk business in what are still the mainstay of the operation, knives. One voluble saleswoman extolled the virtues of a Japanese ceramic utility knife (80 euros, and good for vegetables and fish) while another showed two Americans the many varieties of small folding knives (from 9 euros) -- just in time for a salami lunch.Antica Aguzzeria del Cavallo, Via Drapperie 12; (39-051) 263411.

Not the kind of mud in which children like to play or the kind that signals a renewal of the earth after a rainfall. This is mud that sucks you into a mire, drags you into the ground, threatening to devour your body while forcing you to slog onward, foot over foot, simply to escape.''I can't do it,'' my friend Tini yelled through the rainstorm as she took another step on the trail -- and promptly sank to her thighs in black sludge. ''I can't go on.''We were only an hour into the fourth day of our trek along the rugged Torres del Paine circuit in southern Chile, at the heart of the once mythical corner of the world called Patagonia.The borders of Patagonia are difficult to define, but the name generally refers to the glacier-studded, cone-shaped land mass that straddles Chile and Argentina at the tip of South America and tapers down to Cape Horn. For three days, we had been walking counterclockwise around the Paine Massif, circling around the rear of the imposing towers of granite at the center of Chile's premier national park, 30-pound packs on our backs.We had planned to spend nine days trekking the entire circuit last winter -- the Southern Hemisphere summer -- with side trips up the Valle Frances and Valle Ascencio, two valleys with some of the best views on the route. It all added up to more than 60 miles.This day, the fourth, turned out to be the toughest by far. Nothing in the trek's early stages had prepared us for the long slog up to the John Gardner Pass, where we would cross from the more remote and treacherous eastern-northern half of the circuit to the western and southern sides, where there were large campsites and lodges with bars, restaurants and, if we wanted, catamarans providing a waterborne exit from the trekking route.The pass, at 4,072 feet, wasn't high, and altitude sickness was not a concern, unlike in the northern Andes. Just eight months earlier, Tini and I had trudged to the summit of the highest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro, at 19,340 feet. But the rain -- nonstop all night and morning -- had transformed the terrain into Mordor.So should this be read as a warning to those considering slipping on a backpack laden with a tent, stove and sleeping bag and hopping a flight to these southern reaches?Not at all. I have been trekking all over the world, from the High Sierras to the Himalayas, and no place I've been has, at such a low altitude, the jaw-dropping mountain scenery of Patagonia, whether in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina or any number of other wilderness preserves.More and more people are discovering this. Patagonia is no longer the far-flung destination it once was, only for the dedicated trekker or mountaineer. Tourism in Torres del Paine (pronounced PIE-nay) has boomed in recent years, with North Americans, Europeans and wealthy Latin Americans flooding the park in the high season, December to April. In 2005, more than 107,000 people visited the park, a 51 percent increase from 2000 and two and a half times as many as in 1995, according to statistics from the Chilean government.But with the crowds have come environmental pressures. In all my backcountry travels, I had never seen as many tents as there were pitched at one popular campsite on the northern shore of Lake Peho&#233;, south of the Paine Massif. I counted scores. Trekkers jostled for space in a cooking hut.The Chilean forest service, Conaf, has not placed a limit yet on the number of visitors. But park officials are doing a study to measure the ideal visitor numbers in areas of high use, said Pablo Retamal, the director of tourism at the Chilean embassy in Washington. That study, along with annual research into environmental impact, will help the government decide ''what actions will be taken to prevent and mitigate environmental impacts,'' Mr. Retamal said.Still, for those intending to go to the park, there is a strong argument to be made for making that trip now. Nowhere else are glaciers as accessible as they are in Patagonia. But glaciers there, as in many parts of the world, are retreating at what many scientists consider an alarming rate, because of global warming, they say.TINI and I circumnavigated the Paine Massif the hard way, carrying all our own gear and provisions. But people with less masochistic tendencies can see all the highlights of the park from the relative comfort of lodges, eating meals cooked for them at the end of a long day's hike and downing bottles of robust Chilean red wine. A friend recently spent a week in Torres del Paine at the Hotel Salto Chico, run by a company called Explora, where a customer could pay over $5,500 a week for a package with guided activities like horse riding, birding trips and nature walks.Yet Patagonia, which encompasses a territory equal to the combined surface areas of Texas and California, remains a lonely place, populated by ranchers whose families have raised livestock for generations. The land is consecrated not to humanity's achievements but to those of nature. Its Andean peaks are among the most glaciated in the entire range, supplying water for ecosystems across the vast, arid plains.It has always been a land of legend. After the explorer Ferdinand Magellan passed through on his circumnavigation of the globe, his chronicler Antonio Pigafetta wrote of a race of giants that inhabited the area. The author may have been referring to an indigenous people known as the Tehuelche. In any case, the territory soon acquired the name Patagonia, which my Moon Handbook to Patagonia said was possibly derived from a Spanish romance ''in which a giant named Patagon inhabits an island of fur-wearing hunter-gatherers.''From the airport in Punta Arenas, we climbed aboard a bus that took us on a three-hour ride up to Puerto Natales, the gateway town to Torres del Paine. Ranchers on horses galloped across rolling grasslands dotted with pink and purple wildflowers. The light had an intense clarity, as if a winter storm had just passed through. But it was the height of summer, which meant that darkness did not settle across the land until well after 10 p.m., leaving trekkers plenty of time to make it to their campsites each day.Puerto Natales surprised me. In the United States, towns at the edges of national parks are often chockablock with tacky souvenir shops, the kind that are lined with shelves of buffalo figurines. Puerto Natales felt much more down to earth, and poorer. Pickup trucks rolled through the town's few streets, and many houses had walls of tin sheeting. But the town, situated on the west coast, had stunning views over Last Hope Sound, with snow peaks rising from islands across the water.A large part of the romance of this part of the world is attributed to the popularity of ''In Patagonia,'' a classic 1977 novelistic travelogue by the British writer Bruce Chatwin. He passed through Puerto Natales while researching the book, and described how, during World War I, the English had built slaughterhouses along a four-mile stretch of the bay, complete with a railroad to transport workers here.''The Chilotes had their first taste of mechanized slaughter at the killing season,'' Mr. Chatwin wrote. ''It was something like their idea of Hell: so much blood and the floor red and steaming; so many animals kicking and then stiff; so many white-skinned carcasses and spilled-out guts, the tripes, brains, hearts, lungs, livers, tongues. It drove the men a little mad.''Tini and I spent a day stocking up on food for the trek, then caught a bus in the morning to the park. As we approached, I glimpsed guanacos, or wild llamas, springing through scrubland. A cowboy drove a herd of horses before him, mountains looming in the distance. The familiarity of these scenes, reproduced so often in postcards and coffee table books, did not diminish their impact.We got off the bus, registered at the park entrance and filled our water bottles. Then off we went, following a dirt road past Laguna Amarga and deeper into the park.From the entrance, we should have been able to see the three sheer granite peaks that form the central Paine Massif, possibly the most singular and breathtaking sight in all of Patagonia. But the weather spoiled it for us. Gray clouds cloaked the top halves of those mountains.I wondered about the chances of rain -- nothing ruins a trek more quickly than a downpour, no matter how much weatherproof gear you're packing.It took us a few hours to get used to walking with our packs. The trail was gentle this first day, meandering past an estancia where horses grazed by the path before dropping into a valley carpeted with white daisies. We walked into this valley in the last hour of our trek, when we were exhausted, and at a rest stop we almost literally fell asleep in a bed of daisies.The campsite had a flush toilet, hot-shower stall and a dining hall where cooks prepared hot food. And this was supposed to be one of the more spartan sites on the circuit. If this was roughing it, I was more than ready to handle a week of this, I thought as I curled up in my sleeping bag. Tini was already sound asleep.The next day's walk took us above expansive Lago Paine and up along the side of a valley where we could see the white sawtoothed Andean peaks dividing Chile and Argentina. We passed through a deformed forest of lenga trees, many blackened and twisted by a recent fire. But they were regenerating.That was the thing you learned after spending time in the mountains -- there was never any true destruction when nature was left to its own devices; everything was reborn somehow.We ended the day at a campsite by another lake, one with views across the water to an enormous patch of snow and ice called the Ventisquero Dickson. It was the tip of one of the largest icecaps in the Southern Hemisphere, the Hielo del Sur. If the many scientists who assert that these enormous icecaps are fading at an unnatural rate are right, their disappearance will not only rob nature enthusiasts of awe-inspiring views, but also entire ecosystems of fresh water needed for survival.For now, the glaciers are still in abundance. I had never seen anything like them outside Patagonia. Not in Tibet, not in Nepal, not even in northern Pakistan, where glaciers tumble to the very edge of one of the highest roads in the world, the Karakoram Highway.The next day, we walked up a small glacial moraine -- a mound of gray dirt and rubble pushed together by glacial movement -- and stared down into a turquoise lake with icebergs floating across the surface. The icebergs had broken off from the tip of a glacier that flowed right into the lake.That was when it got nasty. I mean really nasty. A fierce wind started up, and we had to partly shut our eyes just to keep out the dirt particles. The sky darkened. We hiked quickly into camp and set up our tent just as the first drops of rain began falling.It poured for the rest of the afternoon and did not let up at all during the night. It was quite possibly the heaviest rainfall I have experienced on any trek.The weather in Patagonia is temperamental even at the best of times, and people preparing for a trip there spend lots of energy figuring out what gear will keep them dry. I had just bought a new tent that was much lighter than my old one; it was untested, and I was worried whether it would keep out the water.It held up better than I expected. I had pitched the tent atop a small depression, so we found ourselves floating in a small pond when we awoke. But none of the water had leaked in.UNFORTUNATELY, the rain didn't let up in the morning, the day we were supposed to cross the John Gardner Pass. We took our time eating breakfast, hoping the rain would stop, but finally decided to start out at 11 a.m.We stumbled through the mud, steadily following the path as it climbed through a forest. Tini sank to her thighs twice. She gritted her teeth and pulled herself up with her wooden walking stick.Once we emerged above the tree line, icefalls appeared on mountainsides all around us. The final stretch to the pass involved a scramble over a steep incline of wet rocks.Even in the rain, with clouds hovering over much of the landscape, the top of the pass afforded the most spectacular view we had come across yet -- a sweeping panorama of Grey Glacier, an 11-mile-long sweep of snow and ice that stretched to the horizon.The trail leading down on the other side of the pass was so steep and slippery that park workers had fixed ropes along trees so trekkers would have something to hold on to. We still fell on our backsides more than once.The crossing of the pass brought us to the easier half of the circuit. The western and southern sides have their share of long-distance trekkers, but are also thronged with day hikers bedding down in expensive lodges like Explora's.Some of the park's most spectacular mountain vistas lie on this side -- the massive rock formations of the Cuernos del Paine at the edge of Lago Peho&#233;, the amphitheater in the French Valley, the three peaks of the Torres del Paine. From a lookout near the Lago Grey campsite, we watched chunks of ice the size of small apartment buildings tumble off Grey Glacier into the lake's turquoise waters.We decided to take it easy for the rest of the trek, waking up late and walking slowly along the crowded trails. On Day 6, we ran into Mai and Jaime, a couple whose wedding we attended in Santiago before our trek and who had come south on their honeymoon. It was a pleasant surprise.We hung out that night at the new Refugio Lago Peho&#233;, on the edge of the lake, eating a dinner of chicken, rice and red wine in the restaurant, the Cuernos looming right outside the windows.The dinner was a welcome break from the instant noodles I had been cooking every night on my stove. Afterward, we played dominoes and Jenga in an upstairs lounge.The lodge was warm, so was the wine. Outside, trekkers scrambled into their tents as a fierce wind swept in from the lake.HEADING SOUTHGETTING THEREMy trip to Torres del Paine started with flights from New York to Santiago, Chile. A recent Web search found round-trip fares for that route in mid-March starting at $835 on Avianca via Bogota, Colombia.From Santiago, I flew on LAN Chile (www.lan.com) to Punta Arenas, at the southern tip of Chile. A round-trip ticket in mid-March runs about $650.Travelers can catch a bus directly from the airport in Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales, the gateway town for Torres del Paine. The ride is three hours and costs 4,000 pesos one way, 7,000 round trip -- about $7.25 and $12.75, at 550 pesos to the dollar. Buses from Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine take two hours and cost 7,000 pesos one way and 12,000 round trip.The entrance fee for Torres del Paine National Park is 15,000 pesos in high season (October to April), 10,000 other times.WHERE TO STAYIn Puerto Natales, we stayed at Hospedaje Teresa Ruiz (56-61-410-472), a warm, friendly bed-and-breakfast where the owner, Teresa, has five spacious rooms upstairs with shared bathrooms. The rates are 4,000 pesos a person for a shared bedroom or 4,500 in a private room.Perhaps the most upscale place in town is the 74-room Hotel Costa Australis, right on the bay (Pedro Montt 262; 56-61-412-000; www.hoteles-australis.com). In high season, double rooms with an ocean view cost $250, others $205.Puerto Natales is a good town in which to stock up on food and gear before heading into the park. There are two main supermarkets and several gear shops. Rooms in popular guesthouses and hotels in Puerto Natales are often booked far in advance for the high season.On the Torres del Paine circuit, we stayed at campsites every night. Their costs vary, but average about 4,000 pesos a night to pitch your own tent.Many sites also have comfortable but basic wooden huts called refugios that charge $16 to $24 a person for a bunk bed and shower. The ones run by a private company called Fant&#225;stico Sur (56-61-710-050; www.lastorres.com/lodges) are reputedly better than those run by Conaf, Chile's national forestry agency (www.torresdelpaine.com). Some sites rent out camping gear like tents and sleeping bags.Trekkers aiming to walk the entire circuit should plan on carrying their own tents, sleeping bags and cooking gear. Trekkers who do not want to carry all that equipment will have to plan their itinerary carefully.The sites on the western-southern half of the circuit are better equipped than those on the less-trodden eastern half. The most upscale lodging in the park is at Hotel Salto Chico, widely known as Explora, on the south side of Lago Peho&#233;. Four nights run $2,170 to $3,110 a person, double occupancy, including all meals and guided activities like horse riding, birding trips and nature walks.WHERE TO EATPub Concepto Indigo, on Ladrilleros at the corner of Bories (56-61-413-609), is one of the better restaurants in Puerto Natales. Main courses are about 6,000 pesos, and I vividly recall a crab ravioli dish I had for lunch there.El Maritimo (Pedro Montt 214; 56-61-414-994) is a decent seafood restaurant with stunning views of the bay and snow-capped peaks across the water.In the park, I cooked almost every night but splurged twice by eating at refugios. Meals at the refugios cost from 3,600 to 7,500 pesos. Backpackers can buy foodstuffs at some campsites.EDWARD WONGEDWARD WONG is a correspondent for The Times in Baghdad.</text></article><article id="1830308"><summary>Seth Kugel Weekend in New York column offers photo scavenger hunt, seeking out scenes and objects intrinsically New York; photos (M)</summary><text>ONE reason people visit New York is to catch a glimpse of things they'd never see in the average American city. Some such sights are mystifying, some charming, some jaw-dropping -- and some are even legal.This week, Weekend in New York offers a photo scavenger hunt, in which you (working alone or in a group) seek out scenes and objects intrinsically New York and capture them with your camera. The hunt could be the centerpiece of your weekend, but also could serve as just a way to enhance your downtime as you wander from restaurant to park to museum, observing the natives in their natural habitat.If competing against others, award two points to the team that does the best in each category, and one point to anyone coming in a reasonably close second. Or, if you're playing alone, just award a whole bunch of points to your own team and declare yourself the winner.FOODBiggest crowd waiting for a brunch table: Sociologists are unable to explain it, so why should you even try? New Yorkers like to wait -- arms crossed and toes tapping, of course -- as long as possible for their first meal on Sunday. To qualify, those waiting must be huddled on the sidewalk.Worst bagel/cream cheese or spread combo: Blueberry bagel with olive tofu spread? You can do better (worse) than that. Either a photo of the offending sandwich or, if you don't dare order it, separate photos of the elements qualify.Most expensive pizza slice -- cheese only: The price of a slice of plain old cheese pizza is always creeping up. What's the highest you can find? (Hint: $2 probably won't win.)Most expensive slice, no toppings barred: Add chicken or basil or bacon or artichokes or gold leaf, and watch the price take off like a pickpocket being chased in the subway.Most unusual-looking fruit or vegetable for sale: If it can get through customs, it's somewhere in this city.BUSINESSThe A.T.M. charging you the most outrageous amount for a withdrawal: $2 minimum.Most newspaper/magazine dispensers on one street corner: They're often chained together, and the ones with things you'd actually want to read are empty or require your pockets to be jingle-jangle-jingling with quarters.Most out-of-town and/or foreign language newspapers at one newsstand: In some parts of town, you'd think fans of Le Monde and La Gazzetta dello Sport and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung had never heard of the Internet.Cheesiest Statue of Liberty-related tourist souvenir.Multiple Starbucks in one picture: Two, certainly; three is a challenge.TRANSPORTATIONBest parallel parking job: The city's drivers know that if a parking space is an inch longer than their car, they can ooze in. Be sure to photograph both the front and back ends.Vehicle with multiple parking tickets: The easy-to-spot orange envelopes should be on the windshield or clearly visible inside the car. Old tickets that truck drivers place to avoid reticketing are valid, as are tickets ripped apart in rage.Most yellow cabs in one photo: No fair taking an aerial shot from the top of the Empire State Building.LIVING CREATURESMost unlikely companions: Some New York restaurants specialize in unusual wine and food pairings, but the entire city specializes in unusual people pairings. Is that fashionable babe really dating that pitiful slob? Is that silver-haired guy about three times that woman's age? Is that a rabbi necking with a Senegalese hair stylist? (100 points for the last one.)Best-dressed dog: And by that, we mean worst-dressed dog.Most dogs with one human: In New York, money buys anything, including the guy or gal who comes to your house, picks up your dog and drags it and a bunch of others to the park. Absolute minimum: four dogs.Pedestrian triple-tasking: Someone doing at least three things at once, one of which is walking down the street -- plus eating and talking on cellphone; listening to iPod and reading magazine; or knitting and screaming at friend.Pedestrian stupid-tasking. Someone who is text-messaging while crossing a hyper-busy street, something that could soon be illegal in New York City.Picture of a celebrity on the street: Trick question! In New York you're supposed to ignore celebrities. Minus 20 points.Someone using a pay phone: Not too common these days; even less common, two people using adjacent pay phones (double points).A traffic police officer smiling: It's a tough life giving out tickets to the roughly seven million cars that are breaking parking laws at any one time. Subjected to nasty looks and verbal lashings, these officers don't have much to smile about.Anyone wearing George W. Bush paraphernalia (hat, T-shirt, full body tattoo): Manhattan voted 82 percent to 17 percent for John Kerry over Mr. Bush in 2004. The word on the street is that the president's popularity has not increased.NONEDIBLE INANIMATE OBJECTSPublic advertisements or notices in languages other than English: one point for each language. Spanish is a freebie, kind of like the space in the middle of a bingo card. (Starting clue: Check out the signs about being in one of the first five cars on the No. 1 train to South Ferry.)Most amusing spelling or translation error: Combine immigrant store owners with immigrant sign makers and what do you get? An entrepreneurial spirit that keeps the city's economic engine humming? Yeah, sure, but also errors terrible enough to drive language sticklers insane.Most monstrous baby stroller: It's not that strollers aren't monstrous everywhere, but here the sidewalks, store aisles and bystander tolerance are narrower.Most unusual piece of refuse: A city that collects the strangest things also discards the strangest things, and they don't all fit in a trash bag.Most intellectual book being read in public: O.K., or perhaps just used as a prop to attract a Ms. or Mr. Right prone to lugging around a copy of ''Gravity's Rainbow.'' If you hear someone say, ''Oh, you're into Kierkegaard'' -- whirl, point and shoot.WEEKEND IN NEW YORK | SCAVENGER HUNT</text></article><article id="1830331"><summary>Anthony Tommasini reviews new CD of Monteverdi's Combattimento with Le Concert d'Astree conducted by Emmanuelle Haim; photo (M)</summary><text>Monteverdi: 'Combattimento'  Le Concert d'Astr&#233;e; Emmanuelle Ha&#239;m, director. Virgin Classics 3 63350 2; CD.THE tenor Rolando Villaz&#243;n, one of the hottest stars in opera today, lends his luster to this program of mostly unfamiliar but extraordinary vocal works by Monteverdi. And Emmanuelle Ha&#239;m directs the exciting Baroque ensemble Le Concert d'Astr&#233;e.The main piece is ''Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda,'' an 18-minute work from Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals (1638). Here he chose poetic texts that explore the relationships between war and love: as a soldier storms a fortress, so does a lover lay siege to his adored one's reticent heart.''Combattimento,'' on a text by Tasso, is a viscerally dramatic work for a narrator and two characters. Tancredi, a Christian soldier, has fallen in love with Clorinda, a Saracen. They meet on a battlefield, unrecognizable in their armor. They fight intensely; Clorinda is fatally wounded. Tancredi, to his horror, realizes his mistake, and in her dying moments Clorinda asks for a Christian baptism.The music is an arresting example of the Baroque practice called stile concitato, meaning aroused style. Mr. Villaz&#243;n sings the narrative, which evolves in long spans of intense recitative interspersed with songful reflective moments. When the action heats up, the words come pouring forth in fits, while the instruments erupt with obsessive repeated notes and sputtering riffs.Mr. Villaz&#243;n brings operatic ardor to his singing, which seems exactly right. Yet when understatement is called for, he shapes phrases with tender elegance. Tancredi's lines are sung by Topi Lehtipuu, a plaintive lyric tenor, and the bright-voiced soprano Patrizia Ciofi sings Clorinda.The three share equally the rest of the program, which includes songs, duets and arias from Monteverdi's seventh book of madrigals and ''Scherzi Musicali'' and other collections of his imaginative vocal works.ANTHONY TOMMASINICLASSICAL RECORDINGS</text></article><article id="1830335"><summary>Article discusses role of Savoy family of Lafayette, Lousiana in preserving Cajun and Creole music; photo (M)</summary><text>THIS wasn't a show for Mardi Gras tourists. On Lundi Gras, as they call the day before Fat Tuesday in south Louisiana, the Pine Leaf Boys were onstage before a crowd of locals at the Grant Street Dancehall here. The five musicians, all in their 20s, played songs by Cajun legends like the 1950s accordionist Iry LeJeune and the 1930s fiddler Dennis McGee, but the dancers who were packed shoulder to shoulder on the well-worn wooden floor didn't seem to care about the history. They were more interested in the visceral excitement of the band's signature song, ''Pine Leaf Boy Two Step.''The songwriter Wilson Savoy, a long and lanky accordionist in a white mesh farmer's cap, sang in Cajun French with whoops of excitement. A bleating melodic phrase from his button accordion was echoed by a high-pitched fiddle line and shoved along by an impatient rhythm section of guitar, bass and drums. A spell was cast, combining a mysterious past -- the nearly forgotten dialect and the archaic squeezebox's red bellows -- with an unabashed rock 'n' roll energy conducive to the elbow-flying, hip-swiveling spirit on the dance floor.The band sustained that spell for 90 minutes. The fiddler Cedric Watson, dressed in a blue Cajun Mardi Gras costume with yellow and green fringe, closed out the show with a new arrangement of ''Zydeco Gris Gris.'' Mr. Watson sawed out the infectious tune and led the cries of ''Zydeco!'' The musicians' fellow 20-somethings in the crowd hollered right back.This was the Pine Leaf Boys' seventh show in five days, and if you had spent the Mardi Gras weekend in Lafayette, the biggest city in the Cajun region known as Acadiana, you could have also seen the Lost Bayou Ramblers at the Blue Moon Saloon on Saturday night and the Red Stick Ramblers at 307 Downtown on Sunday night. At each spot you would have found young dancers responding with the same enthusiasm.These three Lafayette bands, with a fourth -- Feufollet, a teenage group that spent the weekend touring the Midwest -- form the core of a renaissance in Cajun and Creole music. After years of recycled arrangements and graying performers and listeners, Acadiana's dance halls are suddenly filled with young musicians, young dancers and a hard-rocking approach to the old acoustic instruments.Next month Arhoolie Records will release the Pine Leaf Boys' second album, ''Blues de Musicien,'' an impressive recording that may vault them onto the national roots-music scene -- though probably not onto the pop charts. They are introducing the album with an East Coast tour that brings them to Connolly's in Manhattan on Sunday night.Cajun music is the fiddle-and-accordion-based sound invented by French immigrants in rural southern Louisiana and first recorded in 1928; Creole was the variation created by their African-American neighbors. In the 1990s Cajun and Creole were eclipsed on the local music scene by zydeco, an outgrowth of Creole that was bluesier and more percussive. There were some great zydeco acts in the '90s -- Beau Jocque, Boozoo Chavis, Geno Delafose, Nathan &amp; the Zydeco Cha Chas -- but they largely abandoned the fiddle, the waltzes and the French language, all essential elements of Cajun and Creole. The Pine Leaf Boys are able to bring back those neglected Cajun aspects without sacrificing any of zydeco's dance-floor excitement.''Cajun music has survived because it's dance music,'' Mr. Savoy, 25, said before the show. ''Cajuns have a need to go out on a Saturday night to a dance hall and have a good time.''When he goes out to dance, Mr. Savoy said, ''I want to hear a 25-year-old kid jamming on the accordion in a bar where young people are screaming on Football Friday.'' Then again, ''I don't want to hear five two-steps in a row,'' he added. ''I want to hear a waltz so I can get close to a woman.''ON the Sunday afternoon before Mardi Gras, Marc and Ann Savoy gave a tour of the home where their four children, Wilson, Joel, Sarah and Gabie, developed their deep affection for Cajun culture. Outside Eunice, La., northwest of Lafayette, the 1911 white farmhouse with the yellow trim and red roof sits at the end of a long driveway flanked by old cypress and oak trees and at the center of a 200-acre farm that belonged to Marc's grandfather. There are home movies, Ann Savoy said, of her children in their pajamas sprawled on the screened porch with their coloring books while some of the greatest figures in Cajun music -- Dennis McGee, Dewey Balfa and D. L. Menard -- jammed with the parents of the oblivious children.Like many Acadiana musicians Wilson and his siblings more or less inherited the family business from their parents. Marc Savoy is one of North America's most respected makers of button accordions, smaller and reedier-sounding than piano accordions. His shop, the Savoy Music Center in Eunice, sells Cajun instruments and recordings. With his wife and the fiddler Michael Doucet of Beausoleil he plays accordion in the Savoy-Doucet Band; last year he self-released his latest solo album, ''Marc Savoy Plays Cajun Accordion: Back to the Basics Savoy Style.''Ann Savoy, a singer and guitarist, has her own bundle of projects, including the Zozo Sisters, a duo with Linda Ronstadt that resulted in the 2006 album ''Adieu False Heart'' (Vanguard). Nominated for a Grammy for best traditional folk album, it lost to Bruce Springsteen last month.Ms. Savoy's parents were jazz buffs in Richmond, Va., and she revisits those roots on a swing record to be released in May, credited to Ann Savoy and Her Sleepless Knights. Meanwhile her all-female Cajun band, the Magnolia Sisters, is working on a second album of traditional Cajun children's songs. And the second Savoy Family Band album, with Marc, Ann, Wilson and Joel, is set for a summer release.''Music was a part of the household,'' Ann Savoy, 55, recalled. ''The instruments were all over the place. We didn't make a big deal about taking lessons. We just said you can pick up an instrument and join in if you want. Sometimes the best way to drive children away from music is to pressure them to play.''Marc Savoy, 66, added: ''When Wilson said, 'Daddy, can I play your accordion?' I said, 'Sure, but you have to treat it with respect, because it's delicate. But don't expect me to show you anything. You have to figure it out for yourself.' ''He admitted that later, after he saw that his children were serious about music, he showed them a thing or two. ''This music is part of who we are as a family and a people,'' he said, ''so you don't want to screw around with it.''The Savoy tradition was also passed along to Joel, who was a founding member of the Red Stick Ramblers. He didn't adapt well to the band's grueling road schedule and amicably departed to start a new Cajun-Creole label, Valcour Records. His most recent release is ''Allons Boire un Coup: A Collection of Cajun and Creole Drinking Songs.'' Featuring contributions from the Pine Leaf Boys, the Red Stick Ramblers, the Lost Bayou Ramblers, Feufollet, Ann Savoy and Joel Savoy himself, the disc's combination of old songs and fresh approaches is a fine introduction to the lively revival.''I want to document what's going on here,'' Joel Savoy, 26, said, ''because it's exciting to see all these young kids playing this weird traditional music with accordions and fiddles and to have all these young kids eating it up like it's the coolest thing ever.''Joel Savoy's commitment to the Cajun-Creole revival includes organizing a traditional Courir de Mardi Gras near his parents' home. This old rural Mardi Gras run features costumed revelers on horseback or foot going from farm to farm to beg for chickens for the gumbo pot while a Cajun band wagon plays on an old hay wagon.In recent years the courirs in many Louisiana towns have allowed floats, beads, recorded music, uncostumed onlookers and drunken fights until, he said, they became a bad parody of Mardi Gras in New Orleans's French Quarter. So he and his childhood friend Linzay Young started a traditional courir.''Linzay and I have always been into creating our own scene,'' Joel Savoy explained, adding, ''We did that with the Red Stick Ramblers and now we're doing it with our Courir de Mardi Gras.''So it was that at 9:30 on Mardi Gras morning 300 people in screen masks (made from window screens), conical caps and fringe-draped costumes stood in the front yard of Joel Savoy's neighbor, Rick Smith. Mr. Smith was on his roof, holding a writhing, flapping chicken in each hand. He was willing to donate them to the gumbo pot, but according to custom he was going to make the maskers chase and catch the chickens. The maskers responded by stretching out whichever hand wasn't holding a beer.Meanwhile, beneath a tree in the yard, Joel's brother Wilson, dressed in a plaid costume with gold and maroon fringe, was playing accordion while Joel, decked out in a red and yellow costume, was playing fiddle. It was Cajun music for catching chickens, and the two brothers were beaming.MUSIC</text></article><article id="1830336"><summary>Mali musician Amadou talks to Winter Miller, through translator, about predominantly African music he's listening to now; photos (M)</summary><text>THEY are best known back home as ''the blind couple of Mali.'' Here they are known by their first names. Amadou Bagayoko, 52, and Mariam Doumbia, 48, met in 1974 in the orchestra of Mali's Institute for the Young Blind. They began touring in 1978 with their band, Eclipse, and in 1980 they were married. Ten albums later, as Amadou &amp; Mariam, they are renowned in world music circles. Amadou, who plays electric guitar and is a fan of Led Zeppelin, calls their music Afro-rock. On 2005's ''Dimanche &#225; Bamako'' (Nonesuch), they teamed with the Franco-Spanish producer Manu Chao, the patron saint of found sounds, and the result won them a Victoire, the French equivalent of a Grammy. They sing in French and Bambara, Mali's national language, and write their songs together, after a fashion: He's an early bird, she's a night owl. Via translator, Amadou spoke recently by phone from Bamako, the capital of Mali, with Winter Miller about the predominantly African music he's listening to now.GigiGigi is Ethiopian but she lives in the United States. I found ''Gold &amp; Wax'' (Palm Pictures) in San Francisco. (It's difficult to find music I want to buy in Bamako. It's mostly cassettes and not many music stores.) Gigi sounds as if she's from Mali. We have common ancestors, so I feel a big connection with her and to that sound. I go to sleep almost every night listening to this album. My wife doesn't like it as much as I do. (I use earphones.) This album is like dreaming. I listen to Malian storytellers, they meet in the village and tell us stories from centuries ago. This has the same feeling.AyoBorn to a Nigerian father and Gypsy mother in Cologne, Germany, Ayo is an original -- not just in the way she sings, but in her whole style. When you hear her on the radio, you can't say that reminds me of so-and-so. The lyrics on ''Joyful'' (Polydor) are English, and she sings rhythm and blues. Ayo's backup band is standard: bass, guitar and drums, nothing out of the ordinary. What's different is Ayo's voice. It's high, thin and light; I'm telling you it's like no one else's. You might think that a child is singing.Mamani KeitaThe very first time I ever heard her was on the radio in Mali, 20 years ago. I met her, and we became friends. Mamani's music -- for example, ''Yelema'' (Emarcy) -- is a mix of Malian and electronic that feels modern. She sings in Bambara, but the music is a fusion of Malian, electronic, modern, jazz and blues. She has this strong, sentimental voice that carries a great deal of emotion.Toumani Diabat&#233;''Boulevard de l'Ind&#233;pendance'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch) is traditional Malian. Toumani plays the kora. It has 21 strings. He's modernized the kora, but he can also adapt his playing style. With Spanish people he adapts to flamenco. With a griot he's traditional. With a bluesman he plays the blues. He's played with a lot of different musicians, some American and Spanish. He's played with Taj Mahal, the bluesman. He doesn't sing, he only plays.K'naanK'naan is a young Somalian rapper who sings in English on ''The Dusty Foot Philosopher'' (Track and Field). He uses a traditional drum similar to the djembe. I understand a few words, but his melodies are similar to Malian. He's interested in talking about peace, so I think these things are in his lyrics. Since I don't speak English, I don't know.Ba CissokoFrom Guinea in West Africa, Ba Cissoko is a group of musicians playing the kora in a modern and original way (''Electric Griot Land,'' on the Totolo label). They sing in Manding, which is not exactly like Bambara, but I understand it. It's like the difference between British English and American English. They play electric koras and use a wah-wah pedal. With the electric kora they add effects like reverb and distortion. They are definitely trying to imitate Jimi Hendrix. I can't play kora: it's too difficult, too many strings.

I only take exception to her telling her mother, while riding in the car with the whole family, that the boys needed a shower because they smelled really bad. Her brother Jason reacted exactly like a normal teen when he almost punched her. Her comments to her mother should have been made in private.Jane JanisNew Canaan, Conn.Your article about the siblings of children with autism is a cautionary tale. One of the most important functions of a parent of a child with a disability is planning for the future. The responsibility to care for an adult child with autism and a significant functional impairment should not be inherited by a sibling, who may not have agreed to assuming such a role.Planning should include the creation of appropriate supports to provide for the care and financial needs of disabled children when they reach adulthood. Unfortunately, many disabled individuals with loving and caring parents and siblings end up in at-risk living arrangements when planning fails to take place.Jerry BilinskiWading River, N.Y.As the brother of a mentally disabled older sister, I can relate to Tarah. In my teens, I was embarrassed by my sister's behavior and appearance. Like Tarah, I became the ''older'' one and the ''superchild,'' flying under the radar so my parents didn't have to worry about me.

Then the former co-worker vanishes, and Schottland is drawn back into the spy game.''So many people have something in the past that eats at them,'' Ms. Isaacs said, sitting in the glass-walled sunroom of her stately colonial overlooking three serene acres.Though Ms. Isaacs, like Schottland, is feisty, funny and smart, the comic novel is hardly autobiographical.After graduating from Queens College, Ms. Isaacs went to an employment agency and took an aptitude test for computer programming.''I failed it,'' she recalled. She went to work as an editorial assistant at Seventeen magazine, writing advice for the lovelorn. In 1968 she married Elkan Abramowitz, then a federal prosecutor and now a criminal defense lawyer. Two years later she gave up the senior editor slot at Seventeen to stay home with her newborn son, Andrew, and three years later, a daughter, Elizabeth, was born.As a retirement gift, Mr. Abramowitz gave her an electric typewriter. Ms. Isaacs freelanced political speeches and magazine articles. While her children napped, she read mysteries. When her daughter, now 33, went to nursery school, Ms. Isaacs started writing her first novel, ''Compromising Positions,'' about a Long Island housewife turned sleuth who seeks the killer of a philandering North Shore periodontist. It was published in 1978.The book was made into a 1985 movie starring Susan Sarandon and Raul Julia for which Ms. Isaacs wrote the screenplay. Her fourth novel, ''Shining Through,'' set during World War II, became a movie in 1992 starring Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith. Ms. Isaacs also wrote and co-produced ''Hello Again,'' a 1987 comedy starring Shelley Long and Judith Ivey.Ms. Isaacs, whose fiction has been translated into 30 languages, said her storytelling talent, along with a sense of humor and a dollop of skeptic, came from her father. An electrical engineer, he used to make up simple stories about, say, the camel that didn't brush its teeth or the lamb that bit its nails.It takes her about two years to write a book, she said, ''taking out time to have a life.'' Using a voice-recognition program, she speaks the dialogue into her computer, rather than typing. ''The faster I can get it from my mind onto the page, the better for me,'' Ms. Isaacs said, though she uses longhand for some descriptive scenes.Ms. Isaacs lets Mr. Abramowitz read her work first.''He has a kind of built-in logic and the ability to cross-examine my situations and also characters,'' she said. Still, ''he is benevolent,'' she added.Asked which of her books was her favorite, Ms. Isaacs declined to use the motherly standard. ''You are supposed to say, 'They are all my children,' '' she said.In fact, she had no trouble choosing. ''I would reread either 'Shining Through' or 'Magic Hour,' '' she said, because ''the relationships in them were not easy.''Once she finishes a novel, Ms. Isaacs said, she feels as if it is no longer hers.''I feel a real loss,'' she said. ''The only thing to do is then to come up with something else that is mine.''She's not wasting any time. The protagonist of her next novel, a whodunit, is a woman ''who has led a very superficial life,'' she said, ''someone who is a nice person but very concerned about fashion and makeup.''As usual, Ms. Isaacs said she is plotting the whole book first.''The planning out,'' she said, ''is the most fun.''</text></article><article id="1830360"><summary>Joanne Starkey reviews Nonnina restaurant in West Islip, NY; photos (M)</summary><text>NAMING a restaurant Nonnina -- an affectionate diminutive term for grandmother in Italian -- makes a statement. The word is wrapped in warmth and nostalgia, with many of those fond memories revolving around food.At Nonnina, which opened in West Islip in mid-November, the food might be homey, but the d&#233;cor is sophisticated and sleek; grandma is looking good.The restaurant took over the quarters that were once home to the Bridge. Gone are the photographs of bridges under construction and the full-wall picture of the Robert Moses Causeway, replaced by colorful vintage Italian posters. (The large metal wine rack shaped like the Brooklyn Bridge remains, however.)The huge, marble-topped bar is a hub of activity, and a fireplace surrounded by love seats and comfy chairs has cozy appeal. The dining room is just as welcoming, with its rows of high-backed, striped banquettes, two-toned hardwood floors, rustic brick wall and white-cloth-topped tables.On a quiet Monday, the B team seemed to be in place in both the dining room and the kitchen. Our waiter that night was lackluster and usually elsewhere. Several dishes were underseasoned (salt and pepper are not on the table). On a Friday, the service was attentive and the food improved.A few dishes that needed a flavor boost on that Monday were penne with wild mushrooms, mascarpone, peas and porchetta (bits of pork), a ho-hum Caesar salad and fritto misto (fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini) that was 90 percent calamari. An antipasto plate was mixed. Baby artichokes, eggplant caponata and a zucchini relish cried out for salt, but assorted olives were sparked by citrus zest and red pepper flakes, and lush roasted red peppers crackled with crunchy fried capers.On Friday, though, a couple of salads sparkled. The menu's green salad boasted Lloyd Harbor greens (a new one on me), black olives, tomato, cucumber and a sprightly cabernet vinaigrette. Even better was a special of yellow and red beets, orange, reedlike asparagus and goat cheese under a garnish of crisply fried leeks.Try one of the crackly, thin-crusted pizzas. The robiola cheese version with mascarpone, truffle oil and chives was a full-flavored, satisfying shared opener.The hearty pastas are recommended. I loved the pappardelle with its meltingly tender braised lamb shoulder, small chunks of squash, cipollini onions and bits of broccoli rabe for bite. The house-made ricotta cavatelli Bolognese was another standout, with a sauce of three-hour-braised veal, pork and beef.Encountering lobster hash browns, an accompaniment to a perfectly grilled veal chop special, should not have been a surprise. This delicious dish, which I remember from Tellers Chophouse in Islip, no doubt traveled here with Nonnina's co-owner, Robert DiPierro. Mr. DiPierro was general manager of Tellers for six years. (His partner is Paul Aniboli, who ran the Bridge.)Richard Soriano, the chef, also has an impressive r&#233;sum&#233;; a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, he was most recently executive chef for Cipollini Trattoria in Manhasset.Many of the rib-sticking headliners at Nonnina are reminiscent of the fare at Cipollini. A special of fall-away-tender boneless short ribs was a keeper. So, too, was the menu's osso buco, bolstered by a farro risotto with a pleasing texture. The best entree sampled was a juicy Berkshire pork chop set over a m&#233;lange of roasted tomatoes, hot cherry peppers (which can be served on the side), apple and escarole. The whole branzino was beautifully cooked but stone cold; after being boned at tableside it had sat waiting for the other entrees to be delivered from the kitchen.The top dessert is the feathery light chocolate torte atop pools of chocolate and raspberry sauces. Lemon-poppy ricotta fritters were moist but delivered no hints of either lemon or poppy. A plate of five miniature cannoli, studded with pistachios and chocolate, was a homey finale, and one that grandma herself might have served.Nonnina999 Montauk Highway  West Islip  (631) 321-8717  www.nonninarestaurant.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE -- A beauty with two fireplaces and an upstairs dining room overlooking the bar.

But, aside from the kebabs, what a meal at Shish Kebab House most brings to mind is a quieter version of Indian cuisine.The restaurant's West Hartford location, which opened in August 2006, replaced the original Shish Kebab House on Franklin Street in Hartford. For those who knew the old place, the menu here is the same.A collection of kebabs, which arrive off the skewer, accompanied by a generous portion of rice pilaf and a vegetable, are at the core of the menu. A kebab is such a simple thing: meat, poultry or seafood that is seasoned (perhaps marinated) and cooked with dry heat. But it is this very simplicity that is difficult for the cook to achieve. There is nothing to hide tough meat or ill seasoning.All of the kebabs that my guests and I have eaten here, with the exception of a rather strong-tasting swordfish, have been exceptionally good. The lamb, offered either as chunks of leg or slices of loin on the bone, was particularly delicious. Well seasoned with spices that enhanced the flavor, both cuts were very tender when I tasted them, despite being cooked to medium.While somewhat chewier, the beef kebab was equally tasty and splendidly meaty. The chicken was tender, not dry, and more flavorful than usual.India enters the scene with the pilafs, vegetables and some of the appetizers. According to the menu, the pilafs are made with a particularly fine long-grain rice from the south of Afghanistan. ''Brown'' rice pilaf (the rice turns golden brown in the cooking -- it is not unhulled) is mildly flavored with cumin. The kabeli palow is scented with both cardamom and cumin, and garnished with raisins, almonds and sweetened julienne of carrot. In both, the delicate grains of rice are dry and separate from one another, and very reminiscent of an Indian pilaf.Each kebab is served with a choice of vegetable (vegetarians can order an additional one in lieu of meat). I particularly liked both the mushrooms, saut&#233;ed with thickly sliced onion and chunks of tomato, and the savory, dark orange pumpkin pur&#233;e, the candylike sweetness of which is balanced by a pleasant tartness and a little heat. Potatoes and spinach are perfectly pleasant if more ordinary, but I found the thick rounds of eggplant -- steamed, fried and topped with yogurt -- too heavy and tasting of deep-fry oil.Appetizers are a fascinating mix for those unfamiliar with the cuisine. Samosas are crisp, deep-fried triangles stuffed with potatoes and served with a spicy cilantro dipping sauce. Mantoo are steamed dumplings, wrapped in a thin, delicate dough and filled with meat that has been cooked with coriander and onion; the dumplings are topped with tomato, homemade yogurt, yellow split peas and dried mint. Ashak are a slightly different version of the same, filled with spinach and scallion, bathed in tart yogurt and a spicy tomato sauce, dotted with ground beef, yellow split peas and dried mint. Less exciting were pakawra, wedges of potatoes that are battered and deep-fried.Pea soup is a homey pur&#233;ed concoction based on tomato, seasoned with garlic, coriander and a little cayenne. And the salads are enormous, whether you choose a lemon or yogurt dressing, both with little or no oil.A couple of the desserts are first-rate: The fernee, an Afghan rice pudding flavored with cardamom and rose water and topped with berries, is a dead ringer for the Indian rice pudding kheer, and baklava is a pleasingly dry and chewy rendition of the walnut- and honey-layered phyllo dessert.An unexpected pleasure, discovered at my first meal here, was the Afghan tea called sher chai, a milky, spiced tea that closely resembles Indian chai (though without the sumptuous richness of the buffalo milk) -- a fine end to a satisfying meal at a reasonable price.Shish Kebab House Of Afghanistan36 LaSalle Road  West Hartford  (860) 231-8400  www.afghancuisine.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE -- The ground floor has a bar and a small market with rugs (some very good quality) and groceries; the dining room is on the second (elevator allows wheelchair access).THE CROWD -- Mostly older, casually dressed; very few children despite a children's menu.THE BAR -- Full bar with small, reasonably priced wine list.THE BILL -- Dinner entrees, $15.95 to $26.95; $31.95 per person for an Afghan feast that includes a mix of appetizers; one dumpling; seafood, beef, chicken, and lamb kebabs; all vegetable sides; kabeli palow and spinach rice (four-person minimum).

On a cold night, a small log fire snaps in an outdoor kiln. In the foyer, the H.Y.O.C. (hang your own coat) policy signals a relaxed mood and a certain trust. Inside, the hostess is welcoming, the wait short. It's a great-looking room, with a soaring red-lacquered ceiling and dark coffered walls. The curb appeal is real, which may explain why tables fill up early on weekends.But beneath the veneer, DeerPark's kitchen doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. On my first visit, the food showed promise, but a week later, on a busy Saturday night, almost everything our party of four sampled was resoundingly mediocre.The menu borrows much from the standard New American playlist -- crab cakes, short ribs, yucca fries -- with fillips from the culinary front lines (pomegranate vinaigrette, carica fruit). From wings to whipped cauliflower, the offerings cover a lot of ground, and it would take an awful lot of discipline to get it all just right. The trouble with an overly familiar menu like the one at DeerPark Tavern is that diners have often experienced a given dish done better elsewhere.Tavern food is by definition hearty, but at DeerPark the heartiness too often lapsed into heaviness. Bold flavors sometimes bullied the rest of a dish; cheddar and blue cheeses, chorizo sausages, piquillo peppers, red onion, broccoli rabe and broccolini, fistfuls of olives -- all were overused. Other offerings -- a bland turkey Bolognese comes to mind -- needed more, not less, spicing.There were things to like, especially on my first visit. A dollop of lobster salad with crunchy celery was fresh, if undersalted, and it came with delicious grilled long-stemmed artichokes. A spinach salad with shaved fennel, Maytag blue cheese, spiced pecans and a good sherry vinaigrette (I will forgive the underripe caramelized pears) was lovely. Two entrees were simple and satisfying: a pink-at-the-center hamburger with fat fries, and a tender, peppery grilled filet mignon set on a potato pancake (too much chopped broccoli rabe sandwiched between the filet and the pancake was symptomatic of the kitchen's lack of restraint).The star was a beautiful lean piece of Arctic char crusted with toasted pistachios, its plate dotted with a mix of tiny pattypan squash, cherry tomato halves, candied fennel and porcini mushrooms and drizzled with a sweet-tart blood-orange glaze. It was the precise, delicious nature of this dish that made me wonder why the kitchen couldn't produce another to equal it.The menu opens with more than a dozen ''small plates'' that can either work as shared appetizers or bar food. Of the small plates we sampled, seared diver scallops with white beans, pancetta and a white truffle vinaigrette won faint praise. Long-stemmed artichokes, something of a house specialty, were paired with prosciutto and an avalanche of olives. Petite lump crab cakes were sharply spiced and a bit mushy. Ginger-scented calamari salad, served too cold, was almost cloyingly sweet. Grilled dates wrapped in serrano ham were greasy and very, very rich, and I could not detect the blue cheese that was billed as part of the dish. Smoked trout salad tasted tired, and if the ''grilled'' avocado slices garnishing it had been grilled, it escaped me.Things might have looked up with entrees, but they did not. Fire-roasted shrimp with chorizo, piquillo peppers, grilled corn and black rice needed more time on the fire, and the heat of the peppers dominated. A thick sirloin steak was neatly sliced, its flavor heightened by peppercorns and smoked salt, but the accompanying creamed corn risotto was dense and undersalted. A generous braised short rib was velvety but very fatty.Desserts are limited. But the fudge brownie ice cream sandwich, with its smooth mocha ice cream, chocolate sauce, toasted walnuts and whipped cream, was really very good. Sour cherry bread pudding and apple cobbler were both on the heavy side. A bittersweet ''chocolate bag'' filled with raspberry sorbet, whipped cream and fresh berries seemed like banquet fare.DeerPark Tavern  40 Deer Park Road (at Routes 35 and 22)  Katonah  (914) 232-9104SATISFACTORYTHE SPACE -- Tavern-style dining in a handsome, lofted room with upholstered banquettes.

''Now it looks like they're moving ahead.''The median sales price for a single-family home in the county dropped 3.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006 -- the first time since 1994, when the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service began compiling quarterly sales figures, that the median decreased during the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier. The median price for a single family home in Westchester as of Dec. 31 was $630,000, down from $652,250 on Dec. 31, 2005.Also, the number of sales for single-family homes fell almost 15 percent -- to 1,121 -- at the end of last year, and the dollar volume of sales for that category was down 11.5 percent, to $987 million, according to numbers compiled by the listing service.But the declines in such sales figures actually may be good news in disguise, according to Mark Boyland, a leader of a sales team for Keller Williams Realty, an Austin, Tex.-based real estate franchiser with offices in White Plains and Yorktown.''Prices will continue to come down, but that's what we need,'' Mr. Boyland, who is also president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, said, suggesting that a readjustment in prices would entice buyers into the market and in turn boost the number of sales.The listing service noted that many sellers, anxious to get top dollar for their homes, have been in denial during the past two years, refusing to recognize that a correction in the market is under way and runaway price increases are a thing of the past.As sellers finally readjust their sights and buyers respond to the current reality, real estate offices have been reporting an increase in inquiries and more robust turnouts at open houses, with a significant portion of the renewed activity coming from Wall Street types who are receiving substantial bonuses this spring, said Mr. Meyers at Houlihan Lawrence.''What we're seeing is a younger group of buyers in their 30s who are experiencing their first rush of liquidity,'' he said.Real estate offices are also reporting a pickup in weekend home sales in North Salem, Bedford and Pound Ridge and in Cold Spring in Putnam County and Pawling in Dutchess County, Mr. Meyers said.''There are some famous people out there looking for horse country with lots of acreage and plenty of quiet, away from the crowds,'' he said. ''As Bedford has grown, buyers are considering properties that are farther north, where there's more land available and less commotion.''</text></article><article id="1830416"><summary>Article on Peter Denenberg, music producer and owner of Acme Recording Studios in Mamaroneck, NY; photo (M)</summary><text>AT first glance, the door at 112 West Boston Post Road hardly seems like a portal to rock 'n' roll heaven.

As exciting as it sounds, this is all in a day's work for Mr. Denenberg.''I always say that my recording career began because my friends and I kept getting thrown out of everybody's house, because our bands played too loud,'' said Mr. Denenberg, 44, who grew up in Larchmont and lives in Mamaroneck with his wife and two children. He is a lanky man, whose steel-rim glasses and goatee give him the air of a hip graduate student. ''We basically needed a place to play and record. I started renting this space in 1982, with my business partner, Rory Young. We also have three full-time employees, who assist in recording.''Mr. Denenberg worked on records by the Def Leppard singer Joe Elliott and others, throughout the 1980s, but as the '90s began, providence came calling in the form of the then-unknown Spin Doctors. Their multiplatinum CD ''Pocketful of Kryptonite'' was done at Acme. According to the group's leader, Chris Barron, the decision to record there, as well as the sessions themselves, happened with a minimum of fuss.''When we signed with Epic Records, someone at our label suggested we record at Acme, because he liked Peter's work,'' Mr. Barron said. ''It turned out to be a great choice. Peter had us rehearse for a week in the studio before we laid down one note. By the time we rolled tape, we were really tight. We did the whole record in a month.''Mr. Barron credits Mr. Denenberg's offbeat humor as integral to the creative environment at Acme.''If we were listening back to something pretty, he'd say: 'Yeah, it's great. If you like music,' '' Mr. Barron recalled. ''He has incredible ears for sonic details, but his personality puts people at ease and helps them sound better.''Mr. Denenberg says he is more dedicated than ever to his trade in Westchester. Not only does he engineer in-studio concerts with performers like Chris Isaak and Aimee Mann for the growing Westchester radio station WXPK-FM -- known as the Peak -- but he also teaches a music production class at SUNY Purchase.''Teaching has rejuvenated me. I'm psyched that students are interested in learning my profession,'' he said.''With the advent of home studios, guys like me are in less demand than we once were,'' he added. ''Kids can do things cheaply on their own now. But I have equipment that most artists probably don't own, like vintage consoles for listening back to their recordings.''Still, what I'm trying to teach goes beyond technical ideas. Very often, the most talented musicians need someone to coax the music out of them. What I'm saying is, producers are creative people, too. That's the secret to our continued success. We're not just button-pushers here.''</text></article><article id="1830424"><summary>David Corcoran reviews Chimichurri Grill in North Bergen, NJ; photos (M)</summary><text>AS a restaurant critic, I've never put much stock in ambience. Good food is good food, to my way of thinking, whether the setting is a mountaintop or a strip mall, whether the diners are wearing silk or denim. This time I was wrong.The Chimichurri Grill on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan is one of at least a dozen Hell's Kitchen standbys where Times Square worker bees like me go for a slightly out-of-the-ordinary meal -- a nine-year-old Argentine steakhouse that is solid, pleasant and dependable but far from dazzling.The Chimichurri Grill on Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen has the same management and virtually the same menu (with slightly lower prices). But it could hardly feel more different.Part of it is the d&#233;cor: generic in Manhattan, utterly captivating in North Bergen. Before they opened this younger sibling in May 2005, the owners, Carlos Darquea and Alicia Rodriguez, transformed the space that had been the fondly missed Stephen's Cafe. With its oxblood- and maize-colored walls, its moody sconce lighting and its tiny bar, it feels like a cafe in an intrigue-laden European capital (or Buenos Aires, a center for European &#233;migr&#233;s) between the world wars.Then there's the tango music -- performed live, on our Saturday night visit, by the great Tito Castro of Argentina, playing the accordionlike bandone&#243;n. His sinuous renditions of standards like ''Jealousy'' and ''Hernando's Hideaway'' carried a tart nostalgic melancholy that somehow lent depth to the food, like a smoky red wine. Come to think of it, like an Argentine malbec, the ideal mate to Chimichurri's protein-heavy bill of fare. The chef, Mr. Darquea (dar-KAY-uh), who came to New York from Argentina about two decades ago at age 33, says he wants to replicate the cuisine of Buenos Aires -- a rich amalgam of red meat from the grasslands of the Pampas, pasta from the large community of Italian immigrants and home cooking from every chef's grandmother.The meat, imported from South America, is rougher hewn than high-end steakhouse fare, but still delicious. It is cooked on a parrilla, a gas-and-lava-stone grill whose V shape, Mr. Darquea says, concentrates the heat and allows the fat to drain. What emerges are thick cuts of charred, juicy steaks, chops, sausages and ribs -- served, of course, with ramekins of the Argentine parsley pesto called chimichurri, offered here in two versions, green (mild) and red (hot).Two diners could make an outstanding meal of any of the combination plates called parrilladas. The largest, at $48, incorporates filet mignon, short ribs, hanger steak, chorizo, blood sausage, lamb chops and sweetbreads, along with great crisp French fries.The steaks are not particularly tender, but mouth filling and powerfully satisfying. The chops have distinct lamb character, the sweetbreads are soothing and mild (like veal without the chew) and the sausages are potent. The blood one is a weighty tube of offal that tastes as rich and dark as it looks, even if its ingredients do not bear close contemplation.Nonmeat dishes also get star treatment from the grill, especially an appetizer of beautifully charred calamari and another of shrimp with a sweet, tart and spicy peach chutney. On one of our visits the grilled whole fish of the day was Patagonian trout, simply seasoned with herbs, precisely cooked and flawlessly boned.Empanadas are delightful here -- the crusts rich and flaky, the fillings (ground beef, pulled chicken or Swiss chard with sheep's-milk cheese) homey and savory. And the homemade pastas are authentically Italian with an Argentine twist: the lasagna is made with crepes instead of noodles.Desserts are made in house and with flair. Dulce de leche lends its gooey dark sweetness to a smooth ice cream and to a lavish pair of crepes. Three scoops of sorbet -- passion fruit, lemon and blood orange -- were tiny but terrific. Even the chocolate tart, soft and intense, was well above average.Chimichurri, with just 44 seats (34 more in an outdoor garden that will reopen in spring), was full and lively on that tango-filled Saturday night, but dismayingly empty on a subsequent Wednesday. A lot of diners are missing a good bet. Good food is good food, but seldom does it come in a package as well wrapped as this one.Chimichurri Grill  7722 Bergenline Avenue  North Bergen  (201) 453-2345  chimichurrigrill.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE An atmospheric storefront, intimate and dimly lighted, with a compelling d&#233;cor; live tango music on some weekends.

It's even harder if there is a Starbucks right across the street. Yet not only is Landmark Coffee in business, but it also is often busier on weekday mornings than its globally marketed competitor.A steady stream of commuters, most making their way to the New Jersey Transit terminal or the PATH station in Hoboken, line up inside the cozy, elbow-room-only shop each morning for the traditional American-style coffee ($1.60 medium), espresso ($2.10) and latte ($3.35).It's not a place to hang out for an extended period of time; there are just three stools against a narrow counter. Over the 13 years Landmark has been in business, however, Bobbie House, the owner, has forged strong relationships with many customers. Polaroid photos of regulars and their babies hang on the wall.''We know our customers by name,'' Ms. House said. ''We know what they drink, if they are pregnant, planning on moving, everything, because we really talk to them.''The coffee comes from Kobricks, a Jersey City company. The pastries come from seven bakeries around northern New Jersey. There is traditional breakfast fare like bagels with cream cheese ($1.60), scones ($2.75), muffins ($1.25) and breakfast breads like chocolate and lemon-poppy ($2.50 a slice).The cafe also serves 35 teas (medium cup, $1.18) and can cater a coffee service for up to 100 people on short notice.Landmark doesn't sell compact discs, or chocolate-covered beans, or T-shirts.And Ms. House never mentions the place across the street by name.It's not that she is superstitious.

Mr. Rauschenberg, who was accused of vandalism, defended his action by explaining that he was exploring a new kind of creative act -- making a work of art through the unmaking of another. This classic of anti-art is now in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.Art historians and museum curators prefer the term destruction art these days as they attempt to put a more cerebral spin on a questionable activity. The term derives from the Destruction in Art Symposium, or DIAS, held in London in 1966, whose participants were a ragtag bunch of international artists, poets and scientists dedicated, according to the event's often-cited press release, to exploring ''the element of destruction in Happenings and other art forms.''''Unmaking: The Work of Raphael Monta&#241;ez Ortiz,'' a powerful new show at the Jersey City Museum, surveys the 50-year career of one of the original DIAS participants. This little-known experimental artist, who has been on the arts faculty at Rutgers University for more than 30 years, is presented here as a trailblazer who has been unjustly overlooked.There is truth to the claim, for few people were experimenting with taking apart, unmaking or destroying objects as artworks in New York in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Mr. Ortiz, now 72, was also among the first artists in the country to experiment with video, television and film; ''Golf'' (1957), showing here, uses an instructional film on golf that the artist bought at a store and then vandalized using a hole-puncher. The film and the audio still function, but the images are almost completely defaced.The current exhibition samples the artist's output from his early film pieces through the present, with about 20 works on loan from museums and private collections all over the country -- no small effort for a little museum like this. It is arranged thematically rather than chronologically, enabling viewers to get a sense of some of the recurrent themes in the artist's work. These include a fascination with ritual, performance, religion, transcendence and, of course, violence.Mr. Ortiz was an unlikely experimental artist. The son of Latino immigrants to New York, he began his career studying architecture at the Pratt Institute; his first artworks were thickly brushed, gesture-filled abstract paintings in the manner of de Kooning. Showing here is ''De Kooning is DeKleining'' (1960), one of the few surviving examples of Mr. Ortiz's abstracts from this period. It shows talent, but no real understanding of or sensitivity toward paint application and composition.Fortunately, Mr. Ortiz had plenty of talent in areas other than painting. He gave up abstraction in favor of object-making using found materials and gradually found a home for himself among the heterogeneous experimental art community emerging in New York at this time. His invitation to participate in DIAS London helped him to connect with a network of like-minded international artists, including Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Juan Hidalgo, Hermann Nitsch, Al Hansen and John Latham, figures all loosely associated with the destruction art movement.Mr. Ortiz's signature works are his destruction art pieces, made in ritualistic public performance events (sometimes filmed or photographed) in which the artist acts like a shaman, singing, dancing and, ax in hand, destroying things. Pianos have been a favorite target; he has staged more than 80 piano destruction events in museums and galleries around the world. Documentary images of some of these performances are showing here, along with the remains of a piano destruction performance recently completed especially for this exhibition.Along with pianos, the artist has also destroyed a variety of domestic objects: sofas, armchairs and especially mattresses, the remains of which were purchased by collectors and eventually donated to major museums. On loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York is ''Archeological Find No. 3'' (1961), a torn-apart, cut-up, smashed, rolled-together and burnt mattress that looks like a big blob of gum. The artist considers these destructions a kind of psychic excavation; when the objects are taken apart, their true spirit is revealed.Mr. Ortiz, who lives in Highland Park, continues to make art. Some of his most recent works are what he calls ''digital paintings,'' two-dimensional pieces made of computer-generated imagery printed on industrial vinyl sheets. Though the garish colors take some getting used to, the paintings, like his previous works, demonstrate an enthusiasm for new technology and appropriated imagery. They suggest that Mr. Ortiz is embarking on another phase of his career.''Unmaking: The Work of Raphael Monta&#241;ez Ortiz,'' Jersey City Museum, 350 Montgomery Street, through Aug. 27.

Yet the community of losers (or survivors, depending upon one's idea of success) who teach at the financially ailing English language school for foreigners operated by him and his tottering but cheerful lover, Eddie (Andrew Boyer), never stop invoking his name and his authority.Centenary Stage Company has approached Mr. Gray's gently chattering play with obvious affection. Still, in spite of a cast of insightful character actors and skillful direction by Carl Wallnau, the end result is pallid and predictable. We've met these rather generic types before, and while the painful struggles of their circumscribed lives may touch and engage us briefly, this doesn't make for high drama.Not that Mr. Gray is stingy in his plotting. Over the course of the nearly three years covered in the play, Anita (Katrina Ferguson) will turn a blind eye to the philandering of her husband, Nigel, to accommodate her desire to have children. Melanie (Becky Engborg) will finally be rid of her stroke-disabled, haggish mother (we're not sure how) and turn to religion for solace. Mark (Jay Gaussoin), maniacally absorbed in the writing of his novel, will be abandoned by, then reconnected with, his wife and son. Henry (Steven L. Barron), everyone's anchor, will become devastated by his daughter's mental illness. And Derek (Christopher Young), the accident-prone new addition to the faculty, will set a wedding date with his beloved Daphne.The only constant is St. John Quartermaine (pronounced SIN-jon and played with a vague otherworldliness by Steven Dennis). He begins and ends the play with the same somnambulistic affect, sitting on an English wing chair in a corner of the faculty lounge, staring into space. (John Hobbie's set sends all the right signals.) A bachelor, he is tirelessly solicitous of his colleagues -- inquiring about their families, ever-ready to baby-sit for their ill-bred children or to arrange after-work outings to plays that no one cares to see. Through it all, he suffers pangs of rejection in a cocoon of solitude, yet takes strength from the sense of community he feels as a part of the lounge's extended membership.St. John finds it ''hard to bear'' that everyone around him is in turmoil. But his nonconfrontational, marginal approach to living, while stopping him from truly engaging with the world, protects him from total despair. The rest of the gang doesn't have that luxury. They must find a way to keep going forward while dealing with the nasty business of everyday life. The caring if artificial community they have created in the teachers' lounge becomes key to their survival. Poignantly capturing this very human means of getting by, Mr. Gray almost makes us forget his play's basic flaws.''Quartermaine's Terms'' will be at Centenary Stage Company, on the campus of Centenary College, Hackettstown, through March 11.

To the east, it is an urban colossus: Co-op City, a mass of high-rises and stores that says to the southbound motorist, ''You're not in Westchester anymore.''So it should come as no surprise that, in recent years, the clang, clang, clang of construction has meant something very different, depending on which side of the highway it was being heard.To the east, where a bank loan is financing $234 million in repairs to Co-op City's crumbling garages and cracked windows, it is a sign of revival after years of neglect.''We didn't have the money to address these problems for the longest time,'' said Al Shapiro, first vice president of the board of the RiverBay Corporation, the resident-owned entity that oversees Co-op City. ''I think people are happy that they see action, that something's going on.''But to the west, where developers have spent the last decade erecting apartment complexes, row houses and one- and two-family dwellings on every bit of available land, there is considerable anxiety.''There used to be backyards, where people had barbecues and planted flowers and vegetables,'' said Pamela Simpson, 52, a co-owner of Plata's Jamaican Restaurant on Eastchester Road, ''and those have become housing sites.''Yet Rashid Hamadi, 38, a probation officer and father of three who lives in a new building with his family, said all the construction had helped to make Baychester an ''up and coming'' area.''I think they're good for the neighborhood,'' he said of the buildings, standing outside his own on a recent evening. ''There's something nice about a new place.''Baychester is not the only neighborhood in the city to feel the press of development, of course. The new millennium has brought a wave of construction in all five boroughs, with the city issuing permits for 31,600 new housing units in 2005 -- the most in any single year since 1972 -- and nearly as many last year.A large-scale rezoning initiative has provided some semblance of protection for neighborhoods under siege throughout the city. And two years ago, that initiative came to the southern and western sections of Baychester, where officials rezoned all or part of 163 blocks, restricting development to one- and two-family houses in most sections. A similar rezoning that would cover 131 blocks in northern Baychester and beyond is in the works.George Bookis, the broker-owner of Aztec Realty in nearby Morris Park, said the rezoning, coupled with a land shortage brought on by the initial burst of development, has helped to slow construction west of Interstate 95 in the last couple of years.But Baychester is still a neighborhood transformed -- on both sides of the highway.What You'll FindBaychester, broadly defined, is bordered by the Hutchinson River to the east, Pelham Parkway to the south, Laconia Avenue to the west and Boston Road to the northwest. About 77,000 live in the neighborhood, some 50,000 of them in Co-op City.One could easily mistake the area's southern section, known as Pelham Gardens, for a humble slice of Westchester. The large brick houses are fully detached and the yards attractive, if modestly sized.North of Allerton Avenue, the neighborhood takes on a more Bronx-like cast. The houses, made of brick and siding, are generally smaller one- and two-family dwellings, many semidetached.The typical house consists of a duplex on the upper two floors, an apartment on the lower floor and a finished basement, often being used as an extra apartment.West of Interstate 95, commercial development is limited. But the locals do make use of a motley mix of low-rise shops on Boston Road and East Gun Hill Road with names like Paint-A-Lot Hardware Store, Gorgeous Nails and Stepping Up Shoe.Once an Italian stronghold, Baychester is now largely black and Latino, with a heavy Caribbean influence. Brother Produce &amp; Fish, at Boston and East Gun Hill Roads, sells Jamaican water crackers and Twist Shandy, a Barbadian mix of lemonade and beer, alongside its fruits and vegetables. And the Flamingo Lounge Bar and Grill, wedged between a ball field and a driving range, offers up jerk pork and a nighttime mix of reggae and R &amp; B.East of the highway, the dominant force is Co-op City, a towering collection of 15,372 apartments in 35 high-rises and 7 town-house clusters. Built in the late 1960s on the site of the Freedomland U.S.A. amusement park, it is the largest co-op development in the country, with its own security force and power plant.Forbidding to some in its design, Co-op City is nonetheless known for its friendliness. ''At its best, this place is what this country can hope to be,'' said Mr. Shapiro, adding later, ''I see incredible kindnesses here.''What You'll PayThe grandest houses, in Pelham Gardens, rarely come up for sale, agents say. But when they do, they command upward of $800,000, sometimes more than $1 million.In central Baychester, most one-family houses sell for $400,000 to $500,000, brokers say. Two-family dwellings sell for $500,000 to $600,000, and three- and four-families command $600,000 to $700,000.Prices have appreciated in the last five years, with the median for single- and three-family houses growing by about one-third from 2001 to 2006, according to the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors Multiple Listing Service.But Mark Rushie, an agent with Century 21 Sheik's Realty on East Gun Hill Road, said it was not clear that a house bought today would significantly grow in value over the next few years, given the slowing of the Bronx real estate market.At Co-op City, which residents call the best deal in the city, places can be had for $3,500 a room. Prices range from $10,500, for a three-room one-bedroom, to $22,750, for a six-and-a-half-room three-bedroom. Whatever the resident's initial investment, the co-op repays that amount when the resident leaves.Carrying charges -- which cover gas, electricity, heat, air-conditioning, security and maintenance -- range from $522 to $1,131 a month, depending on the size of the apartment, said Steven Gold, director of residential sales and marketing for the RiverBay Corporation.Applicants must undergo credit and criminal background checks and a home visit, and meet income restrictions. To get a five-room, two-bedroom apartment, for instance, a family of four must earn at least $38,280, at most $95,088.According to Mr. Gold, Co-op City has one-bedrooms available at the moment. Newcomers flexible about where they land in the complex could be installed within a few months.The waiting list for two- and three-bedroom apartments is six to nine months, Mr. Gold added. For those requesting specific locations within the complex, the wait is longer.What to DoWest of the highway, those with a taste for the Caribbean can sample stewed peas, tripe and beans, and curried chicken with carrots and okra, at Plata's.Similar fare is available at takeout restaurants on East Gun Hill Road, also home to the old Gun Post Lanes bowling alley, known for its Day-Glo interior. Haffen Park, a nine-acre site that dates back to the 1950s, offers basketball and tennis courts, a pool and a baseball diamond.On the other side of the highway, alongside Co-op City, the main attraction is the Bay Plaza shopping mall, which includes a J. C. Penney, a Barnes &amp; Noble and an AMC movie theater popular with theteenage set.There is also the 2,700-acre Pelham Bay Park, the largest in the city. Egrets, heron and raccoons roam Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary. And tens of thousands sunbathe at the milelong Orchard Beach, created by Robert Moses in the 1930s.Just southeast of Pelham Bay Park is City Island, a little slice of New England known for its seafood.The SchoolsBaychester area public schools have a mixed testing record.At Public School 97, on Mace Avenue, 68 percent of students met city and state standards in English in the school year that ended in 2005, compared with 61 percent citywide. Seventy-one percent met math targets, compared with 65 percent citywide.At Middle School 144, on Gunther Avenue, 30 percent of students were graded as proficient in English, versus 43 percent citywide. Twenty-eight percent met the math standard, versus 41 percent citywide.Co-op City has three public elementary schools, two middle schools and Harry S. Truman High School, which offers a fitness center and a television studio.In the school year ended in 2005, Truman students averaged 399 on the verbal section of the SAT and 403 on the math; statewide averages were 497 and 511.There are several parochial schools in the area, including Nativity of Our Blessed Lady School, a prekindergarten-through-eighth grade school with 290 students on Dyre Avenue, and Cardinal Spellman High School, on Needham Avenue, which has about 1,500 students.The HistoryBaychester was largely marshland until a cucumber farm and pickle factory sprang up in the late 19th century, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. Strawberry farming followed.

ON THE STREET</text></article><article id="1830471"><summary>Jeremy Kost mingles with guests at cocktail party for his exhibit of large Polaroids at SoHo Grand Hotel in New York City; photos (M)</summary><text>IN a back room at the SoHo Grand Hotel on West Broadway, the walls are covered with giant Polaroids of New York night-life moments that you won't see when trolling the meatpacking district with your platinum Amex: a young woman who looks as if she was dipped in gold; a man in briefs lounging with anticipation on a zebra-print rug; and two dewy-skinned women who seem ready to exchange a delighted kiss. These shots weren't as provocative as some that did not appear, apparently.Jeremy Kost, the photographer behind the show, ''Not a Play Area,'' described one shot that was removed after the opening on Feb. 2, which attracted hundreds of people. ''It was of a guy who had his hand in his underwear, and his face was contorted and he was covered in raw red meat,'' he said.Mr. Kost mingled with the 40 guests who attended his cocktail party Monday night, among them Susan Hancock, an art collector dotted with diamonds, and Tara McPherson, a toy designer covered in tattoos from her wrists to her shoulder blades. She sings in a band called The New York Times (catchy, huh?), which she called ''a cross between Sonic Youth and Sleater-Kinney.''Before arriving to New York from Washington in 2003, Mr. Kost worked at an Internet company and threw one of the biggest (and one of the only) gay parties in that city. He'd always been enthralled with New York night life, so after being transferred to the city, Mr. Kost ditched the workaday world and took up a friend's old Polaroid. It served as a security blanket and an icebreaker, he said, as he traveled through Lower East Side bars and red-carpet premieres alike.Sitting under a photograph of a giant clown, Mr. Kost asked his friend Leigh Ross, an assistant director at a Chelsea gallery, what she had thought of his exhibition. ''I would love to see it in a big white cube,'' she said, before offering effusive praise. Mr. Kost, sounding slightly annoyed, said his show was hung in the style of an installation at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.Later, Mr. Kost and some guests migrated uptown to Aspen, a restaurant in the Flatiron District, where he has weekly salon-like dinners. ''Aspen comps all of my dinners,'' he said, ''because they embrace the energy and diversity of the people I bring to them.'' (Surely they also embrace the fact that tonight's comps could be tomorrow's big spenders.) During the cab ride to Aspen, Emiko, a Japanese conceptual artist, giggled and said: ''Jeremy is a free pro. He gets a lot of things for free.''As guests passionately discussed art over polenta fries, a drag queen named Candice Cayne lip-synched, with mixed success, to songs like Madonna's ''Vogue,'' and re-enacted scenes from ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' Ms. Hancock admired Ms. Cayne's beauty, even tipping her $40. ''Those are implants,'' Mr. Kost said, ''but she has all the other stuff.'' Ms. Hancock's eyes grew wide. She was quiet for a moment. ''Well,'' she said eventually, ''she works hard for her money.''Ms. Cayne wasn't the only one sweating for tips that night. At Boys Club, a dingy East Village hole-in-the-wall, Mr. Kost and his now dwindling troupe watched as men in thongs and high-top sneakers sauntered about, dollar bills tucked into their waistbands. He seemed a bit unnerved. ''I'm used to a different type of night here, John Waters standing next to Hedi Slimane standing next to guy who works at the Gap,'' he said.A friend who performs in drag as Mistress Formica said Mr. Kost wasn't always welcomed at his events, adding, ''I used to get so angry at him because he would take pictures of me in compromising positions.'' Mr. Kost laughed and said, ''You don't know how many of those pictures I have.''A Night Out With Jeremy Kost</text></article><article id="1830472"><summary>Sleeves on women's blouses and dresses will be billowy and lacy this spring; photos (M)</summary><text>Wave, stretch, gesture theatrically or just stand arms akimbo.

PULSE</text></article><article id="1830474"><summary>Kate Dawson and Jedidiah Cohen wed in Brooklyn; photos (M) (Vows Column)</summary><text>AS Lili in ''Carnival'' and Lydia Languish in ''The Rivals,'' Kate Dawson has taken her time finding her true love onstage. Her own romantic life required less persuasion and none of the triangulations in those Broadway shows, but it hasn't been without its theatrical moments.''For an actor, when it comes to love, the fireworks you feel onstage can be confusing,'' said Marla Schaffel, a friend of Ms. Dawson's, who is now in ''Tall Grass'' off Broadway. ''Real love isn't what you see in the theater.''Ms. Dawson and Jedidiah Cohen became acquainted in the spring of 2004 as students in a musical-theater-acting master class in New York. She mentioned that she had enjoyed his performance a few years earlier in a show called ''Personals'' and reminded him that they had met backstage.Mr. Cohen was flattered, he recalled, but he had no memory of their earlier meeting. But that was then. ''I remember noticing her immediately,'' Mr. Cohen, 30, said of their second encounter. ''She's a beautiful woman.''After class, the students often went out together to unwind. ''Somehow Jed and I always found ourselves sitting next to each other and talking, mostly about being unlucky in love,'' Ms. Dawson said. After hearing one of her tales, he replied, ''Any guy who isn't interested in you is clearly nuts.''To Ms. Dawson, who earned a bachelor's in musical theater from Millikin University in Decatur, Ill., ''It was music to my ears.''Mr. Cohen learned that Ms. Dawson moved to New York in 1996 from Champaign, Ill., with the dream of starring on Broadway. She had landed her first part in a staged reading of ''Parade.'' She had won roles in ''A Christmas Carol'' at Madison Square Garden and at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival.She learned that he sang with the Michigan Opera Theater when he was 8 years old and made his New York stage debut at 12 in ''The Turn of the Screw'' with the New York City Opera. He also had featured roles in ''Home Alone'' and ''Home Alone 2'' and made his Broadway debut in ''The Secret Garden'' while in high school.''Jed has a big voice, Irish tenor quality: It's strong and clear,'' said Adam Wolfsdorf, who was a member of the Harvard Krokodiloes, an a cappella singing group at the university, where Mr. Cohen, also a member, was working on an undergraduate degree in astronomy and astrophysics.''I felt pretty sure he was interested,'' Ms. Dawson said. So she invited him to her 30th birthday party. He soon reciprocated, inviting her to a party where there would be karaoke singing -- something Ms. Dawson had never done. At the bar, they made a bet over which of them could accurately guess from their vantage point what it was that another table of guests was snacking on. When she asked about the stakes, he asked what she wanted.''A kiss,'' she said, with boldness that still surprises her.Mr. Cohen, who had built up a reputation for remembering all of his lines, was temporarily at a loss for words, but then suggested that they forget about karaoke and leave. A friend soon found them outside the bar, kissing on the sidewalk. That's the night they think of as their first date.''I had strong feelings from the get-go,'' said Mr. Cohen, now a vice president of Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate in New York, doing sales, management and training.The next bold move would be his. In class a few weeks later, he was rehearsing ''It Might Be You,'' the theme song of ''Tootsie.''The teacher of the master class, deploying a technique to extract more expressive performances from his students, demanded to know from Mr. Cohen to whom he was singing.''It's Kate,'' Mr. Cohen said, catching the teacher unaware of their beginning romance. The teacher then asked Ms. Dawson to join Mr. Cohen at the front of the room, whereupon he resumed singing the love song, this time looking directly into her eyes.''It was a movie moment,'' Ms. Dawson said. ''You don't expect it to happen to you.''Mr. Cohen recalled thinking that ''there was something so right and uncomplicated'' about his relationship with Ms. Dawson, whom he grew to miss when she would leave for shows in St. Louis and elsewhere.''Once we got into our groove of dating, it became a partnership like nothing I have ever known,'' said Ms. Dawson, who went on to perform in productions of the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey and do voice-over work for television and film, including ''The Devil Wears Prada.''Last spring they started talking about engagement rings. She helped him shop, but he surprised her with a proposal in the garden of a Chelsea restaurant.Ms. Dawson and Mr. Cohen were married on Feb. 25, with snow falling outside, at Stage 6 at Steiner Studios on the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They stood under a canopy made of grapevines, with white orchids and tiny shimmering lights laced through it, with the prayer shawl of the bridegroom's late grandfather stretched across.The bride's ivory gown by Pronovias, the Spanish gownmaker, with its ruffle lace bolero, was also sparkling with crystals. Rabbi Marcia Rappaport officiated, with the Rev. Paul M. Mayer, a nondenominational minister, taking part in the ceremony.At the reception that followed, their friend Rudy Martinez sang ''It Might Be You'' for their first dance. Later, Ms. Dawson, in her elegant soprano, and Mr. Cohen serenaded each other, singing ''The Next Ten Minutes'' from a musical called ''The Last Five Years.'' (''I would love to come back to the theater when I'm a little more financially comfortable,'' Mr. Cohen allowed.)The bridegroom and his fellow Harvard Krokodiloes (or the Kroks, as they are known) also performed, with Mr. Wolfsdorf energetically highlighting the group's rendition of ''Runaround Sue.''''Playing being in love in a role, and being in love are so completely different,'' said Nancy Owens, an actress and singer and friend of the bride. ''If anything, it makes you long for the real thing more. When you find someone, when you find the real thing, like Kate and Jed have, it's apparent.''WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS</text></article><article id="1830487"><summary>Excerpts from previously published reviews of restaurants in Sunnyside, Queens (Good Eating column) (M)</summary><text>A visit to Sunnyside, Queens, sounds especially appealing this time of year, and while the trip will certainly not reward you with better weather, your day could turn brighter at these restaurants, a mix of the new and the established.ACASA  (718) 651-1364; 48-06 Skillman Avenue (48th Street); $; $25 and Under: 1/31/07.

''Got to eat,'' he explains in a thick Jamaican accent as he hunches over a large, red machine, realigning a tire on a BMW rim. ''Put food on the table, man.''The walls of Mr. Ducasse's small shop, on Pacific Street, a block from busy Atlantic Avenue, are decorated with a duct-taped poster of Bob Marley and a cheap-looking painting of a topless blonde. The tire-repair machine rumbles and hisses loudly, followed by several loud popping sounds as the tire fills with air and locks into the rim.Mr. Ducasse's large, muscular frame is enhanced by several layers of clothing -- baggy fleece pants over jeans, a gray hooded sweatshirt, a heavy jacket and workman's boots -- and his big, light brown eyes look tired. But he's in good spirits because business is brisk, especially in this weather, when snow hides potholes and rain washes glass, nails and other debris into the road.''All day, all day, all night,'' he says with a wide, toothless smile as he places the repaired tire on the rotting plywood floor of the tiny front room of his shop and rolls it out onto the curbless sidewalk. There, he will bolt it to the car in less than a minute. The charge: $8.Flat Fix, which Mr. Ducasse opened about five years ago, sits on an industrial block that, save for a video store and a funeral parlor, is an uninterrupted collection of automotive services, home to a collision center, a car wash, a mechanic and an open-air establishment that sells gleaming chrome rims. Cars are sometimes triple-parked on the street, and a motley crew of employees and customers loiter on the sidewalk smoking, talking on cellphones or just watching passers-by.Though none of the establishments exude professionalism -- most occupy ramshackle warehouses and are marked by few if any signs -- Flat Fix looks particularly haphazard. In front of the shop, which is housed in a narrow concrete building with a yellow facade, sit stacked traffic cones and orange barrels filled with trash and motor oil. Next door is an empty lot filled with rusting car parts that a mechanic, a slight man from Barbados, uses as his workspace.BECAUSE Mr. Ducasse uses the shop's small garage to store hundreds of new and used tires, he jacks cars up (sometimes with the passengers still inside) on the sidewalk out front. In a few minutes, he can plug ($6), patch ($8) or replace ($25) a regular tire. The Brooklyn Midas, by comparison, charges $90 for a standard tire replacement and doesn't offer repair services.In a good month, he nets only about $700, and ''sometimes,'' adds Mr. Ducasse, who is 51 and lives in East New York with his girlfriend, who works as a substance abuse counselor, ''I don't make nothing.''Before coming to Brooklyn, Mr. Ducasse had been employed on his family's sugar cane farm and then served in the Jamaican military. Because there was little money in agriculture and because he was eager to learn a trade, he moved to New York in 2000. A friend recommended him to the owner of Samantha's, a tire repair shop around the corner on Classon Avenue, and under the tutelage of an elderly employee, Mr. Ducasse spent nine months learning everything he could about tires.When the mentor departed, Mr. Ducasse followed, upon which the pair rented the building on Pacific Street. To swing the $600 rent and the monthly payments on two tire-repair machines, they opened for business immediately, working alone in 24-hour shifts. But his mentor eventually became too old to work, and for the last two years, Mr. Ducasse has run the place himself, spending most nights at the shop, and rarely sleeping more than an hour at a time.He is sometimes joined by Steve Morgan, an old friend from Jamaica, who makes the long trek from Pelham Parkway in the Bronx to spend all day and night helping Mr. Ducasse in exchange for some company and a couple of free meals. The two take turns working and warming themselves in front of an outdoor construction-site heater that fills the shop with the odor of diesel.This evening, after installing a set of fancy new rims on a teenager's maroon Nissan Altima, Mr. Ducasse retreated to the dingy, closet-size backroom that doubles as his living space during the week. Wedged between a mini-fridge and a stack of tire boxes, he watched a few minutes of college basketball on the television set his girlfriend had just bought him. The air was thick with incense smoke and the smell of curry goat takeout.''Tires, parts -- I am quite satisfied,'' he said before heading back to work. ''I don't even own a car.''NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKLYN UP CLOSE Bree Nordenson is an assistant editor of The Columbia Journalism Review.</text></article><article id="1830498"><summary>Photo essay by Lauren Lancaster of places and faces of Wall Street</summary><text>IT was a queasy week on Wall Street. And sweating through every plunge, rebound and fluctuation were bleary-eyed young workers sitting for long hours in front of computer screens in the financial district.For some of these financial types, many of them not long out of college, the largely male environment and shared rituals of life under pressure foster a frat-house camaraderie, with the social life, canned beverages and home d&#233;cor to match.The paychecks are fat, but the nightclubs are expensive, and between work and play, there isn't a lot of time to upgrade that secondhand couch or eat anything more elaborate than takeout.But working hard, staying out late, coming in early the next day hung over and eating a greasy meal at your desk is, for some people, what makes Wall Street special.The week just ended was one of long days and late nights, but to some degree, they all are.

My grandfather was involved in the founding of WBJC, the classical music public radio station in Baltimore. He was an electronics professor and helped create the station to give his students a real-life application of what they were learning.My first job, at Unicef in Washington in the 1980s, was at a time when nonprofits where shifting from being driven mostly by volunteers to hiring professional staff, particularly in fund-raising. After moving to another fund-raising position, I was recruited by the Metropolitan Opera.I had always been interested in music, but I knew little about opera. I thought they were making a mistake in hiring me. Management said my lack of knowledge wasn't a drawback -- I was hired to be a fund-raiser, not a fan. Passionate fans like to hang out at the stage door. Opera fans are like baseball fans. They're fanatical and obsessed with details.Every office had a speaker connected to the stage. To learn, I kept mine on the entire time. I listened to thousands of hours of opera. You hear interesting things during rehearsal, and if they get too interesting, someone switches off the sound. During rehearsals for a new production of ''The Ghost of Versailles,'' the discussions got quite animated. That was one time they turned off the sound.I've spent a lot of time this past year dealing with F.C.C. issues concerning fines for indecency. It seems as if it should be straightforward. Who would be in favor of anything other than a conservative stance? But it's complicated, and we've been caught in the cross hairs.We do a lot of documentaries that occasionally have language that's strong but essential. In order to tell stories honestly and accurately, we need the editorial discretion to make decisions about indecency.I've communicated with F.C.C. commissioners individually and tried to be candid during press conferences. You have to deal with any controversy head-on. People want to be heard and be treated fairly. You get into trouble when you try to bend things to get around them.Fund-raising is the ultimate matchmaking. People have interests that they care deeply about. A fund-raiser helps them achieve things. Someone might have grown up loving dance, for example, but only a small percentage of people can spend their lives in that profession. A donor can make it possible for others to dance.I've tried to help donors effect something that is meaningful for them. Fund-raising takes talent, but you also have to be willing to put yourself out there and know you will be rejected. You can't take it personally. As with controversy, you need to be upfront and straightforward. Being passionate about something takes you a long way.To establish an endowment, you need to be able to describe your vision. There's so much pressure to raise operating money. Using money that comes in as bequests is a fairly easy way to start an endowment because the revenue is not predictable. You can set it aside. Finding key individuals or corporations or foundations willing to make an extraordinary gift helps as well.When I was at WNET, I spoke during a pledge drive about a David Bowie concert we had broadcast. I talked about how, growing up, I loved listening to him. The next day his agent called and said the singer had been listening. He mentioned that Bowie is a fan of public broadcasting, and that we should let him know if there was anything he could do to help. I have not yet figured out a way to parlay that into meeting him.I keep a guitar in my office that our Buffalo station gave me after a music festival. When I was in high school I thought I had great talent. I do not. I had a fantasy that I was going to be the next Joni Mitchell. I clearly am not.

Your company recently announced a new policy to monitor all outgoing e-mail, including personal correspondence. How concerned should you be?A. Don't panic, but definitely watch your back. Mary Crane, president of M C &amp; Associates, a training and consulting firm in Denver, said that if employers actively monitored outgoing e-mail traffic, messages about anything other than work might attract unwanted attention.''The last thing you want to do is make your employer think you're slacking off,'' Ms. Crane said. ''Nothing you're doing on e-mail is worth jeopardizing your career.''Q. Do employers have the right to monitor e-mail?A. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other regulations require publicly traded companies to archive all e-mail messages. Employers in the private sector also have complete authority to scrutinize every word, provided that they have established a policy and put it into writing.Don Ulsch, a lawyer at the law firm Jefferson Wells of Brookfield, Wis., said that although this might seem like an invasion of privacy, it isn't. ''The companies own the computer and servers,'' said Mr. Ulsch, who heads the firm's technology risk management practice in Boston. ''Anything you do on this equipment actually is information that belongs to them.''Mr. Ulsch noted that some states might offer protections for employees who work from home and use work computers for personal purposes after business hours.Q. How common is monitoring of e-mail?A. While companies in many European countries are not allowed to monitor employee e-mail, a vast number of companies in the United States currently do in some form. A joint study released last year by the American Management Association and ePolicy Institute said that 55 percent of 526 responding companies indicated that they had monitored e-mail in 2005.Jeanniey Mullen, a founder of the Email Experience Council, an e-mail marketing organization in Upper Montclair, N.J., said the extent of the monitoring varied by industry. Many companies monitor only e-mail with attached files, while others may monitor every single message, she said.The reasons for monitoring e-mail differ. Some companies say they do it to control the information that employees send through the corporate network. Other companies do it to make sure employees stay on task, or as a measure of network security. Other companies monitor e-mail to see how employees are communicating with customers.Still, logistics make it nearly impossible for companies to police every note. Kevin Kalinich, national managing director for professional risk at Aon Financial Services, an insurance company in Chicago, says that many companies establish these policies because they believe that simply having them reduces the possibility of misuse.''For many companies, it gets to a point where the threat of monitoring is actually more beneficial than monitoring itself,'' he said. ''If you thought someone was watching, would you forward that silly note to your friends?''Q. To what degree is personal e-mail acceptable at work?A. Personal e-mail messages are like personal phone calls -- even the most stringent companies may allow them in moderation. But Cherie Kerr, founder and president of ExecuProv, a consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif., who has helped clients deal with e-mail issues, said that as soon as personal e-mail begins to take more than a few minutes a day, employees may need to reorganize their priorities.''The secret is to do it sparingly,'' Ms. Kerr said. ''If you have to wonder whether you're writing too many personal e-mails on company time, you probably are.''Whatever kind of e-mail you are writing at work, it is important to consider the content before you hit the send button. Obviously, pornography should be off limits. Employees should also avoid distasteful jokes and sentiments that could be construed as a form of harassment.Q. Can you be fired for what you write in personal e-mail?A. Yes. Because companies in most states offer employment at will, they can terminate employees at any time, and may do so if they decide that an employee has misused corporate e-mail.Soon, one exception to this rule may be messages about organizing labor unions. This winter, the National Labor Relations Board was hearing oral arguments on a new interpretation of the law that would prohibit employers from firing employees for using corporate e-mail to plan union meetings. A decision is expected soon.Q. Are there any ways to protect personal correspondence from an employer's eyes?A. Perhaps. E-mail systems like Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo Mail all operate through a standard Web browser, meaning that employees may be able to send and receive messages free of corporate watchdogs.Still, depending on the employer, use of even these sites might lead to trouble. Some companies monitor all outgoing Internet traffic for personal use, meaning that they can read messages from these sites as easily as they can read regular e-mail. Other companies restrict the Internet addresses to which employees have access through the company network, banning Web-based e-mail services completely.David Ries, a partner at the law firm Thorp Reed &amp; Armstrong of Pittsburgh, said that with so many roadblocks, employees might be safest saving personal e-mail for personal time. ''The messenger doesn't matter; it's all about the message,'' he said. ''You have plenty of time to send personal e-mails when you get home.''OFFICE SPACE: CAREER COUCHCorrection:  March 11, 2007, Sunday  The Career Couch column last Sunday, about the risks of office e-mail messages, referred incorrectly to Jefferson Wells, a firm that employs Don Ulsch, a lawyer who said that all information on a company's work computers normally belongs to the company.

Free gas for the minivan. As the spring home-selling season looms, home builders eager to trim mounting inventories of unsold houses amid an industrywide slump are dangling these and other incentives before buyers.''For many home buyers, this is fantastic news; you couldn't find a better environment to buy right now,'' said Carl Reichardt, a housing analyst at Wachovia Securities.But for those who happen to invest in the home-building sector, the news is more somber.Investors have had to contend with home builders' shrinking profit margins, partly a result of costly incentives and deep discounts, along with less-than-stellar sales and earnings. And though their shares have rallied from last spring's nadir -- they are up 30 percent, on average, since June -- they remain 40 to 50 percent below their peak in August 2005, according to Mr. Reichardt.So a new question emerges: Is this a good time to start acquiring home builders' stocks, or are they about to head south again?Both Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the National Association of Home Builders have said recently that the beleaguered housing market might finally have stabilized. And reports last week showed that in January existing-home sales rose 3 percent, though new-home sales skidded 16.6 percent.Stephen Kim, a managing director at Citigroup, is optimistic. In fact, he says, ''time is running out for people to buy.''''We think we will be entering a period where the stocks will go much more vertical in the second quarter of the year,'' he added.Even though earnings are depressed, Mr. Kim is encouraged by a slowdown in the decline of new orders and in the percentage of buyer cancellations. (Toll Brothers, for example, reported a 29.8 percent cancellation rate in its first quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, compared with 36.9 percent in the fourth quarter. At Beazer Homes, cancellations shrank to 43 percent in the first quarter from 57 percent in the fourth quarter.) He also noted that housing starts plunged 14.3 percent in January from December, which means less supply hitting the marketplace.But Mr. Kim is clearly a contrarian in the crew of housing market analysts. Most remain deeply skeptical about the sector.''I don't think now is a good time to buy,'' said Paul D. Puryear, the director of real estate research at Raymond James &amp; Associates. ''I would definitely be very careful with any position in the shares right now.''Mr. Puryear says the earnings outlook is dim for the dozen or so publicly traded builders because their inventories are elevated and because many companies are being forced to write down the value of some land acquired for future development and to forfeit options to buy land.(Excluding land charge-offs, builders' profit margins are already sinking: according to Mr. Reichardt, they average 5.5 percent this year, compared with 11 percent in 2006 and 15.5 percent in 2005.)Ivy Zelman, a managing director at Credit Suisse, is also wary of the sector, ''given the fact that the shares have moved up already.'' She said stock prices had risen in large part because of investor optimism about a seasonal pickup. ''A lot of the good news is already priced in for a spring recovery,'' she added.While a strong spring could improve builders' fortunes, housing analysts aren't exactly sanguine. ''I think the spring selling season will be more bad news for the home builders,'' Mr. Puryear said. Although he believes that the overall housing market may be nearing its trough, he said, ''I disagree with what seems to be the mind-set of Wall Street that we're going to hit bottom and bound right up.''''This is not going to be a V-shaped recovery,'' he said. ''This will be more of a U or an L.''Some analysts worry that a growing number of mortgage lenders -- which rolled out a raft of new products to make purchases more affordable as rates plunged and home prices skyrocketed -- are now tightening their credit standards. In the Fed's most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, released in January, about 15 percent of domestic banks said they had tightened standards on residential mortgage loans over the previous three months, the highest share since the early 1990s.These stricter standards, along with rising interest rates and existing-home prices that are still stubbornly high in some places, are affecting affordability, analysts say, and further hurting the new-home market. ''If you can't sell your existing home,'' Ms. Zelman said, ''you can't buy a new house.''Escalating construction costs have been another factor. ''Over the past three years,'' Mr. Puryear noted, ''we've had tremendous inflation in concrete, copper and any of the metal products that go into a home, and petroleum-based products like gypsum.''Analysts disagree about which home-building companies are best poised to recover quickly. Mr. Kim of Citigroup has a buy rating on all the home builders he tracks, but he is particularly bullish on Beazer Homes, which builds houses in different price ranges and which he says has generally underperformed the group. He and a few other analysts also like the Lennar Corporation, which has been lowering prices aggressively.Mr. Reichardt prefers the Ryland Group because of its geographic diversity and emphasis on entry-level homes, while Gregory E. Gieber, a vice president at A. G. Edwards, is more upbeat about D. R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder, and the Centex Corporation, for the same reasons.Noting that there is often higher demand for entry-level homes, Mr. Gieber says he is more cautious about Toll Brothers. ''I think it might be the last to rebound,'' he said.Toll Brothers, one of the largest builders of luxury homes, reported late last month that its first-quarter profit had declined 67 percent from the same period a year ago as a result of lower sales, write-downs and other costs. The report followed equally dismal results from other builders.But Kira McCarron, the chief marketing officer of Toll Brothers, said she was hopeful of a springtime sales pickup. ''We are seeing in certain regions decent foot traffic,'' she said, adding that the company was preparing promotions this month to commemorate its 40th year of business.For a time last month, Beazer offered a ''Dream Home Dollar Days'' promotion, allowing certain buyers to choose from an array of incentives, including $1 down payments (with closing costs covered by the company), $1 plasma televisions or $1 granite countertops.Among the myriad other builder incentives, which have included free tanks of gasoline, vacations and cars, is Lennar's ''Everything's Included'' program. All new homes, whether entry-level or more upscale, include basic luxuries like higher-end appliances and finished garage interiors.''Incentives are still king,'' said Ms. Zellman of Credit Suisse, adding that some builders are also reducing already-depressed prices by as much as $100,000.These measures will probably entice more people inside the doors of model homes, but Ms. Zellman remains indifferent, calling any resulting improvement in sales ''a head fake of a recovery.''SQUARE FEET: VENTURES</text></article><article id="1830509"><summary>Dow Jones industrial average drop of 416 po&#65533;</summary><text>Let's put this in perspective. Last Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 416 points. That seems like a lot. And, in fact, in the 110-year history of the Dow, it was the seventh-largest point drop.But now look at the percentages. The Dow's decline that day was 3.3 percent -- you could almost call that a blip when measured against the biggest plunges on record.Top billing in the percentage department goes to Oct. 19, 1987, ''Black Monday,'' when the Dow plummeted 22.6 percent (508 points).Next in this hall of famed falls is Oct. 28, 1929, the original Black Monday (which followed Black Thursday), when the Dow sank 12.8 percent. And investors got walloped again the very next day, when the average fell an additional 11.7 percent.That two-day drop amounted to almost 69 points -- a total that would cause barely a batted eyelash now. But back then it was life-altering.Add another big decline the following week and you have all the beginnings of a deep, deep Depression.PHYLLIS KORKKIOPENERS: THE COUNT</text></article><article id="1830510"><summary>LP Wheel owner Tony Lee has</summary><text>MODESTY is not considered a virtue in the vehicle-adornment industry: no one buys bejeweled wheel rims or a platinum steering wheel because he wants to keep a low profile.Instead, such consumers demand flash in order to one-up rivals and epitomize their own success. The more ostentatious a product, the stronger its appeal.The challenge for companies like the LP Wheel Group, then, is how to make each design glitzier than the last. Tony Lee, the owner of LP Wheel, is known among car enthusiasts for his line of Chevrolet and Ford emblems studded with multicolored Swarovski crystals, which are sold under the IcedOutEmz brand name.But in preparation for the annual Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show, held last November in Las Vegas, Mr. Lee decided to create something several degrees more elaborate, and around 1,250 times more expensive: a diamond-festooned, 18-karat white-gold shift knob, priced at $150,000.''I wanted people to feel luxury in the palm of their hand,'' said Mr. Lee, whose company is based in Las Vegas, a hotbed of America's high-end car culture. ''People wear jewelry in their car, so I came up with the idea that the car should wear jewelry, too.''Given the small number of consumers who can afford such opulence, Mr. Lee chose to design the shift knob for a commensurately pricey vehicle. ''For the past couple of years, the most popular car for the big dogs has been the Bentley Continental GT,'' he said, referring to a model with a suggested retail price of about $165,000.Mr. Lee ordered a spare knob from Bentley Motors, a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. The knob has a sandwich-like design, with a metal alloy strip flanked by leather grips. Mr. Lee removed the center strip and created a mold out of its vaguely curvy shape. He used that mold to cast an identically sized and contoured band in 10 ounces of gold.A professional jeweler was then enlisted to affix 30 carats of diamonds into the golden strip, using a setting technique similar to that used in wedding rings. Each diamond is 2.5 millimeters in diameter, a size that Mr. Lee insisted upon for maximum effect: larger stones would have created unsightly gaps around the knob's edges, he said, while smaller stones wouldn't appear dazzling enough to the eye.Mr. Lee estimated that the ultra-blingy shift knob took 100 hours of labor to complete. It was finished just in time for the trade show, where it was displayed in a glass museum case, watched over by a model in an audaciously short dress. ''Everybody's jaw was dropping at how expensive it was,'' Mr. Lee said.So expensive, in fact, that the LP Wheel Group wasn't able to sell the $150,000 knob; it's currently on display at the company's headquarters in Las Vegas.But Mr. Lee said he believed that the publicity generated by the product's mere existence has been worth the investment. Many high-rollers gawked at the glittery knob, he said, ''and a lot of publicists have been calling us about making custom knobs.''''We could easily do a custom for $5,000,'' he added, ''depending on the size and clarity of the stones and the size of the shift knob.''If someone wanted the original, however, Mr. Lee said he might now be reluctant to part with it. ''I would rather just make another piece with the same amount of carats,'' he said. ''But if the price is right, well, everything is negotiable.''OPENERS: THE GOODS</text></article><article id="1830511"><summary>Randall Stross Digi&#65533;</summary><text>WI-FI service is quickly becoming the air-conditioning of the Internet age, enticing customers into restaurants and other public spaces in the same way that cold ''advertising air'' deliberately blasted out the open doors of air-conditioned theaters in the early 20th century to help sell tickets.Today, hotspots are the new cold spots.Starbucks became the most visible Wi-Fi-equipped national chain when it began offering the service in 2002. Now, at more than 5,100 stores, Starbucks offers Internet access ''from the comfort of your favorite cozy chair.''Before you pop open your laptop, however, you need to pull out your credit card. Starbucks and its partner, T-Mobile, charge $6 an hour for the ''pay as you go'' plan. Day passes or monthly subscriptions are available but can be used only at Starbucks stores and other T-Mobile partners like Borders bookstores.McDonald's offers Wi-Fi in more than 8,000 of its 13,700 stores in the United States, giving it wider reach than even Starbucks, and it also charges for access. McDonald's doesn't charge as much: it asks $2.95 for two hours. You can't apply your T-Mobile subscription there, however, because McDonald's works with other partners.Metering and charging for a service, of course, is the prerogative of any business owner in a free market. One will always find entrepreneurs willing to try new ways to profit by erecting tollbooths in front of facilities that had been freely accessible.In the past, this took the form of coin-operated locks on bathroom stalls. (You may have first encountered these at a moment when you were least ready to praise the inventor's ingenuity.)Today, the outer frontier of pricing innovation can be found at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, where some electrical outlets are accompanied by a small sign: ''To Activate Pay $2 at Kiosk.'' This is an experimental service, ''Power Up My Portable,'' which provides chairs and outlets for laptops; $2 buys 20 minutes of juice.But what about the many other wall outlets scattered around the terminals and originally installed for vacuum cleaners? Zenola Campbell, the airport vice president who oversees concessions, demurred last week when asked whether travelers could always count on having free access to those outlets. ''I can't tell you where we're going to be in the future,'' she said.When Starbucks and McDonald's decided to exact a toll from their customers as they set up their in-store Wi-Fi networks, they created a confusion of conflicting signals: how welcome can one feel when staring at a meter that is running?The restaurants' predecessors, the movie theater owners of almost a century ago, understood that not every amenity, every service, every offering must have a separate price tag attached. The owners and the architects sought to give theatergoers an environment that was pleasing in all aspects. Marcus Loew, the head of a nationwide chain, once said, ''We sell tickets to theaters, not movies.''Panera Bread, which has more than 900 Wi-Fi-equipped sandwich and bakery stores, has set itself apart from its contemporaries by upholding the old-fashioned spirit of those bygone theater owners who never stinted in their efforts to make public space inviting.The grand movie palaces did not have to show the revenue-enhancing potential of an ornamental gold cornice or plaster pilaster. So, too, at Panera Bread, where its fireplaces do not have to demonstrate a monetary payback to justify their place in the stores.Neither does Wi-Fi. Neil Yanofsky, Panera's president, said that no cost accounting had been done on its service, which is free. The rationale relates to ambience: ''We want our customers to stay and linger.''A Panera cafe does half of its business at lunchtime -- there is little lingering then. But before and after the lunch rush, the restaurant addresses what it refers to internally as ''the chill-out business,'' which constitutes a not-insignificant 15 to 20 percent of its revenue.Panera has no interest in rushing these customers out -- the longer they stay, the greater the likelihood that resistance to the aroma of freshly baked muffins will crumble. Free, unmetered Wi-Fi is one way the restaurant sends an unambiguous signal: Stay as long as you like.Of course, Mr. Yanofsky is the first to point out that he is in a position to be much more welcoming than the competition across the street at Starbucks. The average Panera store has 120 seats and does about two and a half times as much business as the average Starbucks store.Mr. Yanofsky said he could not see why Starbucks, given its more limited seating, would drop access charges so that it could match Panera's Wi-Fi offering. ''Why make it free?'' he said. ''They're already full.''Each Panera cafe averages 220 connect hours a week; Starbucks and McDonald's declined to provide similar information about the use of their services.In the 1920s, when air-conditioning began to be installed in movie theaters, owners had to spend a sizable sum -- $50,000 (roughly equivalent to $570,000 today) -- to transform the property into a ''cold spot.'' But it was worth it. Before the ''refrigeratory process'' came along, theaters could not draw customers during the summer because of the unbearable heat in confined space. With air-conditioning, patronage increased so sharply that even the largest investments were quickly repaid.Wi-Fi does not address a similar problem of seasonal attendance. Nor will it produce a multifold increase in patronage. But, then again, it's not nearly as costly to introduce as the cooling plants of the 1920s.The access charges assessed at Starbucks and McDonald's suggest that behind the scenes, their service providers have had to make huge infrastructure investments and carry burdensome operational costs. But if the stores already have business-class broadband connections for their own operations, the addition of a Wi-Fi access point is trivial.Schlotzsky's Deli, which offers free Wi-Fi in 82 of its restaurants, uses Internet connections that were already in place, just as Panera Bread did. And Val King, Schlotzsky's director of information technology, said the technical demands of remotely overseeing a wireless network were minimal. ''It doesn't take rocket science to run these things,'' he said.Customers need feel no shame, however, if they need help configuring their laptops, and sandwich makers and baristas are not necessarily the ones who can solve their technical problems quickly.A Starbucks spokeswoman, Sonja Gould, explained that her company's Wi-Fi customers receive, in exchange for their access fees, ''excellent customer service help from T-Mobile.'' It should be added that businesses offering free Wi-Fi also contract with tech-support companies to help customers. One such company, HotPoint Wireless, says its network now handles five times as many sessions originating from businesses offering free access as those that charge fees.Getting connected is one thing, but keeping one's e-mail private is another. Wi-Fi signals, by their nature, are notoriously susceptible to electronic eavesdropping. Wi-Fi services you pay for are no better protected than free services. As T-Mobile informs customers on its support Web page, all wireless service is ''inherently insecure.''Its recommendation should be heeded by users of Wi-Fi hotspots everywhere: use a virtual private network, which provides secure industrial-strength encryption. If your employer does not provide a V.P.N. server, consider using a commercial service, like JiWire, which charges $30 a year for a V.P.N., personal firewall and other services, including a hotspot directory that can be used offline.STARBUCKS, which has rolled out a plenitude of stores, follows the same design concept that is behind the modern multiplex: for interior space, small is beautiful. It's unfortunate that the grand architecture of early movie theaters no longer exists to put today's microscale retail architecture to shame.Gail Cooper, a professor of history at Lehigh University who has written about the introduction of air-conditioning, said: ''In the movie palaces, one-third of the space was devoted to the lobby so people could come and 'promenade' -- today we would say 'hang out.' Welcome was built into the space, and air-conditioning was one part.''The movie palaces are long gone, and so, too, is the novelty of air-conditioning. We now step into public space less to be chilled than to chill. The palace's spiritual successor is the cafe that sends out a welcoming blast of free, unlimited Wi-Fi.DIGITAL DOMAIN Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University.

Besides his own fortune, he invested the money of his employer, King's College of Cambridge University. From 1928 to 1945, when British equities shrank 0.5 percent a year on average, Keynes earned the college an annualized return of 13.2 percent, wagering on stocks and bonds, but also currencies and commodities, using insight into global events.We are all Keynesians now.Sure, after the 1945 Bretton Woods agreement on a regulated international financial regime (of sorts), domestic stock investing predominated. Innovators like A. W. Jones picked equities both to rise (long) and to fall (short), hedging his bets -- hence his term ''hedge fund.''But when Bretton Woods broke down for good in 1971, currencies floated freely, and the era of foreign exchange and commodities ''speculators'' like George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr. ensued. During the three decades up to 1999, Mr. Soros's fund returned more than 30 percent a year on average. Clients who invested $100,000 with him in 1969 would have had $420 million by 2000.The tech crash in the spring of 2000 seemed to end the party, but like all financial carnage it just multiplied the vultures.What Keynes pioneered in so-called alternative investments has become an industry of some 12,000 diverse hedge funds, managing -- if that's the right word -- not just the private wealth of the rich, but also institutional endowments and public pension funds, along with a saturnalia of borrowed capital that draws in the global banking system.''Inside the House of Money'' by Steven Drobny (Wiley, $29.95) pulls back the curtain, slightly. This is less a book of sustained narration or explanation than a notebook of interviews developed from exclusive confabs sponsored by the author's consulting firm, Drobny Global Advisors. Still, the ruminations of supposedly hush-hush hedge fund operators are richly illuminating, and much less expensive than the fees they charge.Nowadays, ''hedge fund'' signifies a legal and performance compensation structure, not an investment strategy. Mr. Drobny focuses on the style of ''global macro,'' which he defines as investing in any asset class anywhere in the world. He dwells little on crucial differences in investment time horizons.But today, he says, all investments, even mutual funds, ''are subject to changes in the world economy, the U.S. dollar, global equities, global interest rates'' and other factors, not to mention wars. ''Global macro,'' Yra Harris, the Chicago-based trader, tells Mr. Drobny, ''used to be called 'geopolitics.' ''The author shows us human beings, not forces of darkness. Many of the 13 interviewees reveal getting a head start from friends of friends and fellow alumni. Some draw inspiration from ''Reminiscences of a Stock Operator'' by Edwin Lef&#232;vre (1923). Several acknowledge harvesting ideas from The Economist. Most now run their own funds, but few enjoy managing people or even portfolios. They love managing risk.A number of themes emerge. First, despite prodigious research, their brilliant ideas can go awry.''If I've gotten better at it,'' the industry legend Jim Rogers tells Mr. Drobny, echoing others, ''it's because I've made enough mistakes.''Another says that ''my favorite trades are when I'm wrong and I get out without losing too much money.''Second, trading and analysis entail different mojo. Mr. Drobny's business partner, the analyst Andres Drobny -- no relation -- says the crucial skill is not just reading a crystal ball on the world, but translating an insight into a trade.Third, incentives have become perverse. In a $10 billion hedge fund, one purist complains, the 2 percent management fee amounts to $200 million, whatever the performance, and as soon as the fund goes up 10 percent, that's another $200 million (20 percent of the $1 billion profit), meaning that the manager can ''close out positions and take the rest of the year off.'' So much for absolute return.Full-blooded characters enliven the text. Jim Leitner, a former graduate student in international finance and Russian studies who grew up in Germany and Turkey, bounced from one trainee position to another before landing at Bankers Trust in 1985. In 1997, he founded Falcon Management, behind a gas pump in Wyckoff, N.J., where he apparently amassed 10 percent of the international market in Turkish lira.In 1999, when an earthquake caused Turkey's stock market to collapse, Mr. Leitner bought shares in Turkish glass companies, anticipating replacement demand. He still follows megatrends and aggregated country data, but he also bores deeply into specific companies abroad. Good global macro has become global micro.Dwight Anderson, a commodities specialist and an alumnus of Princeton's history department (where this reviewer teaches), started as a manufacturing consultant, visiting factories. Then he was hired by Tiger Management, Julian Robertson's firm, to help run a commodities desk. After crunching the numbers on palladium, Mr. Anderson staked out mines in Arctic Siberia and subtropical South Africa, confirming what the data indicated -- a looming supply deficit. Tiger bet that prices would climb. Prices fell.''Julian would always ask, 'Are we right in this situation?' '' Mr. Anderson recalls. '' 'If so, we should be bigger. It doesn't matter that prices moved against us.' '' They doubled down. Eventually, the price of palladium exploded to more than $1,000 an ounce, from $120.Successes like that allow you to be wrong a lot and still trounce the Street. But, Mr. Anderson says, ''as Tiger got to be upwards of $25 billion, positions had to be massive to be meaningful.'' Size helps until it hurts.What is this select group's collective prognosis? Shakeout.Peter Thiel, whose Clarium Capital charges no annual fee but takes 25 percent of any profits, maintains that ''we are living in a world distorted by the biggest financial bubble ever seen,'' adding that ''there has to be a deleveraging of the world's financial system.''Scott Bessent, who ran Mr. Soros's London office when it ''broke'' the Bank of England, shorting the pound in 1992, suggests that what has changed is that now ''your biggest risk can be how your competitor is positioned.'' Welcome to game theory.Yra Harris concurs that ''global risk is way out of line right now'' and that ''there's not enough liquidity to absorb a blowup.'' But he also says that it can be costly anticipating that something ugly is bound to happen, because it may not happen for a while. ''If you're right at the wrong time,'' Mr. Harris says, ''you're wrong.'' So they're all in.Whatever may befall us, many hedge fund types will be O.K. After all, Keynes invented their profession during the Great Depression.''One of these days,'' concludes Sushil Wadhwani, a Keynes devotee and former Bank of England analyst, ''the chickens will come home to roost, and when they do, there'll be huge opportunity.''OFF THE SHELF</text></article><article id="1830523"><summary>Roundup of performance of world's stock markets last week; graphs (L)/</summary><text>Stock markets declined around the world last week after the Shanghai market dropped steeply on Tuesday.

Actually, Mr. Zaric, an owner of the West Village cocktailery Employees Only, has lots of theories. Some of them, on the subject of human mating rituals as they pertain to drinking, are collected in a recent book, ''You Didn't Hear It From Us,'' that Mr. Zaric wrote with his fellow Employees Only owner Jason Kosmas.But recently, Mr. Zaric divulged his latest theory to me at the bar, which is the best place to hear his or any other theories, particularly ones involving the metaphysics of cocktails. I had merely stopped in for a bit of bourbon, because Employees Only had just added a sublime version of the vintage bourbon-based Millionaire cocktail to its menu, but these things happen.''We did this experiment inspired by a Japanese photographer named Masaru Emoto,'' said Mr. Zaric, a native of Belgrade whose clean-shaven head, jangling hoop earrings and dramatic flair with a cocktail shaker lend him the air of an Old World magician.''By taking photos of frozen water molecules, Emoto found there was a difference in the crystal structures of water that had been blessed with prayer and water that hadn't,'' Mr. Zaric said. ''You can see it -- the crystals of the blessed water form these most beautiful shapes. That got me to thinking. What's the effect of my state of mind on all these molecules that I'm manipulating?''He waved a hand at the bottles arrayed behind the bar, an alcoholic periodic table. ''So we conducted this experiment. Five bartenders, all making the same drink. A daiquiri. Measured pours. The same ice. And the drinks were all different. We repeated the experiment many times, and always the same result.''''We cannot know why this is,'' Mr. Zaric said. ''We can only observe the consequences.'' But Mr. Zaric has a theory, of course. ''If the bartender is relaxed and confident the drink will taste one way,'' he said, pausing to shake a martini. ''If he's anxious, if his buttons are being pushed, the drink will taste another. The bartender doesn't want to make you a bad drink -- it just comes out that way.''Mr. Zaric and company christened their version of the Millionaire cocktail -- in which bourbon is shaken with a bitter dash of absinthe substitute and sweetened with house-made grenadine -- the Billionaire cocktail.How to account for the considerable difference of 999 million? Mr. Zaric would say it's all in the attitude. ''Why did my grandmother's food taste so good?'' he said. ''Because she wanted to please me.''BILLIONAIRE COCKTAIL  Adapted from Employees Only2 ounces Baker's 107-proof bourbon  1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice3/4 ounce simple syrup1/4 ounce Absente, Herbsaint or other absinthe substitute1/2 ounce homemade grenadine syrup *  Lemon wheel, for garnish.

The stage moves.Because there will come a moment in the course of this quiet, transfixing tale of grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war, when you will think: ''Wait a minute. Wasn't the sofa on the other side of the room?'' It was.Mr. Shinn's latest work, which opened last night at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center under the astute direction of James Macdonald, is propelled by sly and disorienting shifts of perspective. So it is fitting that this process be reflected physically with a platform stage that makes a gradual, complete rotation by the show's end. Not that this play needs it to make your head spin.Anyone who doubts that Mr. Shinn (''Four,'' ''Where Do We Live'') is among the most provocative and probing of American playwrights today need only experience the creepy, sophisticated welding of form and content that is ''Dying City,'' first produced at the Royal Court Theater in London last year.A three-character drama performed by a bracing cast of two, Rebecca Brooksher and Pablo Schreiber, this deceptively spare work turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. Not coincidentally the plot's catalyst is a charming actor who could give master classes in being passive aggressive.That's Peter (Mr. Schreiber), who shows up one July night -- as unbidden and unwelcome as a bad dream -- at the New York City apartment of Kelly (Ms. Brooksher), the widow of his brother, Craig, a Harvard graduate student who was killed a year earlier during military duty in Iraq. Craig and Peter were identical twins, and when Craig materializes in flashbacks, Mr. Schreiber plays him too.This kind of hokey structural gimmick can turn a promising play into a 3-D drawing board. And the Craig episodes are, on their own, the play's least convincing. But anyone who has followed the career of Mr. Shinn, who is in his early 30s, knows that he uses tidy dramatic formulas the better to frame the defiant messiness of human lives.He hooks you with tantalizing exposition -- and the lure of a wham-bang solution -- and then leaves you alone with your racing mind in a forest of ambiguities. On one level ''Dying City,'' which shades in the uneasy triangle of Kelly and the brothers, is as satisfyingly spooky, crisp and corny as an episode of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' But in answering the plot's whodunit-type questions, it spawns a wriggling host of other, deeper questions that stay with you into the night.These are not, finally, topical questions, though headline events like Abu Ghraib and the fall of the World Trade Center figure as backdrops. (The title's reference is to Baghdad, but it could just as well be New York.)Mr. Shinn is less interested in violence as an external force, which acts upon his characters, than as a means of illuminating what is already inside them. The academic, literary Craig, for example, turns out to be a man who was meant to be a soldier -- for the all the wrong reasons. The gay Peter, who is less assertively physical, clearly learned early that you don't need guns, knives or fists to wound and maim.A cat-footed 90 minutes, ''Dying City'' unfolds as the counterpoint of two nights in the apartment where Kelly, a recently licensed therapist, lives: one in July 2005, when Peter and Kelly meet for the first time since Craig's funeral, and the other in January of the previous year, on the eve of Craig's departure for military duty.Mr. Shinn sets up the play's array of mysteries with the come-on of a savvy window display. Why does the apartment look so bleak and uninhabited? (The artful, purposeful set design is by the protean Anthony Ward, whose credits also include, improbably, ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.'') Why didn't Kelly answer Peter's letter? How exactly did Craig die?Most intriguing, though, is the awkward, defensive self-consciousness of Kelly and Peter as they perform the false, shuffling dance of making nice and catching up. Few young dramatists are better than Mr. Shinn at writing clumsy naturalistic dialogue crippled by the weight of the unspoken.This subtext takes on extra dimensions when you consider the speakers' professions. The subjects include Peter's work as an actor -- in a recent film flop (an action movie in which he played an assassin) and a current stage production (''Long Day's Journey Into Night'') -- and Kelly's as a therapist.Also on the conversational agenda: war, of course, and Peter and Craig's childhood, growing up with an angry father who was a Vietnam veteran; but also television shows (''Law &amp; Order,'' ''The Daily Show''), Peter's changing cast of boyfriends, Kelly's rich parents and William Faulkner (Craig's thesis topic). There's not a word spoken that doesn't feed the idea of the struggle for power among people and how they try to categorize, and implicitly diminish, one another.Mr. Schreiber, a Tony nominee for the revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' last year, credibly summons both brothers without overdoing the differences or the similarities. But he is absolutely terrific as Peter, a human stealth bomber who disarms with friendliness, then hits his target before you can blink.Ms. Brooksher, a 2005 graduate of Juilliard, may well be the discovery of the season. A piquant, delicate beauty who brings to mind the aching openness of the pre-''Ally McBeal'' Calista Flockhart and the intensity of the young Shirley Knight, she expertly locates the obtuseness and vulnerability in her character's willful, careful intelligence. Kelly is a natural victim, though Mr. Shinn allows her the spark of hope of finally having realized this.It could be argued that ''Dying City'' would be even stronger if Mr. Shinn had limited his cast of onstage characters to Kelly and Peter and let Craig emerge by inference. Of the relationships within the triangle, Kelly and Craig's feels the sketchiest, more symbolic than fully lived.But unlike so many contemporary plays ''Dying City'' raises obvious, important issues in anything but obvious ways. And it knows too well that closure, that ghastly word, is a mass-delusional figment of the American imagination. Kelly talks about the satisfaction of watching ''Law &amp; Order,'' in which ''the mystery of a death is solved and therefore symbolically reversed.'' Mr. Shinn knows that nothing about a death -- or a life, for that matter -- is that easy.Dying CityBy Christopher Shinn; directed by James Macdonald; sets and costumes by Anthony Ward; lighting by Pat Collins; sound by Aural Fixation; stage manager, Roy Harris; general manager, Adam Siegel; production manager, Jeff Hamlin.

There isn't a soul in fashion who wouldn't like to see a designer fulfill that promise. We'd all like to know what shapes and proportions truly express a contemporary attitude. Mr. Andersson, however, reverted to looks that have been in fashion for a while, especially at Marni.By this, one means the loose shift drizzled with metallic bits and the intentionally awkward skirt worn with a top that makes a stylistic lunge at futurism (with a shiny or plastic-looking fabric). Mr. Andersson, who succeeds Phoebe Philo, managed to get the shapes right, even if the collection looked more springlike than wintry, but he needs to find Chlo&#233;'s French soul.Mr. Theyskens's Ricci not only looked fresh, but it was also independent of any other viewpoint in fashion. You could see a similarity to the style of Rick Owens in the oversize sweaters and to the skimmy dresses of John Galliano. But the overall impression, the cloudy palette, was entirely different.His real contribution was to suggest an attitude that looked undressed. That's modern. The feathered sweaters in a bias pattern looked as cool and unforced as the long organza dresses and the casual wool pantsuits. Indeed, it was great to see that mix on the runway: now a loose sweater with a long jersey skirt, now a pair of jeans with a blouson silk jacket. And the textures, the slightly cold colors, conveyed an urban sensibility. That puts Mr. Theyskens on a par with leaders like Nicolas Ghesquiere and Raf Simons.Despite the effort Alexander McQueen put into his show -- based on the Salem witch trials of the late 17th century, with a side trek to ancient Egypt -- he could not make the clothes look contemporary or reveal how his molded and three-dimensional shapes may influence fashion in the future.You can indulge a designer's fantastical wanderings if you think they will lead somewhere new, yet with this collection Mr. McQueen seemed to take five steps backward. The hard pointy shapes, the piled-on symbolism recalled the McQueen of his Givenchy days and not the lighter, transcendent McQueen who could capture the desperate energy and beauty of a Depression-era marathon dance.Does it matter that Mr. McQueen based the collection on his discovery that a relative was hanged at Salem in 1692, if only a few of the clothes (a deep green velvet gown with fiery bronze sequins) were wearable? And while it was probably not his intention to torture his models, still that is how they looked in their molded plastic and leather costumes. That was the disturbing thing about the show: the actual female body interested him less than a mold. And you don't think of Mr. McQueen as being that kind of designer.The Herm&#232;s show, held in the grand setting of the Th&#233;&#226;tre du Ch&#226;telet, was further proof that much money and labor could be thrown at little in the name of a luxury house. If there was technical virtuosity in Jean Paul Gaultier's leather jackets and crocodile coats, the motorcycle-gang theme and lackluster design effort obscured it.If the clothes had been more special, if the thinking behind them more curious, you might not have quarreled with the idea of a full-length coat in crocodile that cost as much as a car. Yet, here the effect is obscene.The pop-up invitation to John Galliano's show on Saturday night said, ''The family that eats together stays together.'' It added, ''Creatures with four feet are welcome.'' If Mr. Galliano isn't having the season of his career -- two great Dior shows in a row and a strong men's show in January -- he is certainly having the time of his life.And in ways that he has noted before, fashion is a kind of extended Addams family. Four weeks of shows, and you become acutely aware of the model Jessica Stam's swishing walk and Coco Rocha's great sour puss. Mr. Galliano told a somewhat different story, creating a village atmosphere with food-laden tables and a variety of animals, including dogs and cages of pigs and chickens, but all the human elements and relations were the same.The clothes exactly expressed the different characters within a large dysfunctional family: the sweet dresses with Empire waists and frothy layers; the chic evening skirts, one in draped navy charmeuse with a velvet-cuffed wool jacket; the romantic bias-cut dresses with eccentric stockings; the viperish black tulle frocks with sheer bodices and black garters. The show put you in an idiotically good mood, and you left with the sound of ''La Vie en Rose'' in your head and wondering what Coco and the girls would be up to tomorrow.FASHION REVIEW</text></article><article id="1830764"><summary>Photo of Buddish fire-walking ritual in Nagatoro, Japan</summary><text /></article><article id="1830770"><summary>Photo of man in Purim parade in Holon, Israel; Israeli Army closes off Gaza Strip and West Bank because of fears of attack during festival</summary><text /></article><article id="1830781"><summary>Letter from Linda R Cox of Bronx River Alliance says further improvements to Bronx River can help sustain beavers there (Feb 25 editorial)</summary><text>To the Editor:In ''History Swims in the Bronx'' (editorial, Feb. 25), you ask, ''How much biological diversity can the Bronx River sustain?''

A more freakish juxtaposition of images you could hardly invent. But in ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' his engaging theatrical seminar on the rise of Islamic terrorism, Lawrence Wright draws a connection between the fanciful symbol and the frightful man with persuasive simplicity.Mr. Wright, a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, is an acknowledged expert on Al Qaeda. ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' his compelling, deeply researched history of the development of Islamic fundamentalism, was a National Book Award finalist. So when Mr. Wright talks about Al Qaeda, as he will be doing at the Culture Project for the next few weeks, you're inclined to pay heed.The 75-minute show's personalized title, incongruously recalling a pr&#233;cis of a third grader's summer vacation, indicates that Mr. Wright is not giving an oral report on his own book. Although it has been directed with minimal fuss by Gregory Mosher, ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda'' does not resemble an audiotape performed live. Mr. Wright traces in the background of Mr. bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri (''the man behind bin Laden''), the central figures in the unseen saga that culminated in the horrific events of Sept. 11, 2001.The Islamist movement's roots in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and the galvanizing influence of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, are all touched upon concisely. But Mr. Wright sets aside the historian's objectivity for much of the evening to give us a personal journal of his experience in researching the book. More than a linear narrative about the formation of Al Qaeda, the show is an informal scrapbook of Middle Eastern politics and culture seen through a Westerner's sharp, informed and sometimes sorrowful eyes, complete with visual aids in the form of slides and video clips.Mr. Wright is not what you'd call a born performer. Handsome and personable, dressed informally and regularly consulting a binder of notes, he has the air of a visiting professor not yet at ease in front of the classroom. He speaks softly, in a mostly uninflected voice brushed with a Texas twang.When re-enacting a few of his more impassioned exchanges with sources -- who included acknowledged terrorists -- Mr. Wright occasionally raises his vocal temperature to add a little dramatic heat to the evening. The results are more awkward than convincing. But it hardly matters. His subject is so absorbing that presentation is almost incidental.For Mr. Wright the events of 9/11 hit home in an odd, personal way. He was a screenwriter for the 1998 movie ''The Siege,'' which imagined the fallout from an act of Islamic terrorism in the United States. As the grisly images played across the television screen on that unforgettable morning, Mr. Wright was not thinking, as many dazed Americans were, ''It's like a movie.'' He was thinking, ''It's like my movie.''Inspired to uncover the factual narrative behind the events that had so ghoulishly echoed his fictional one, he began research on the book almost immediately.His journey led him to Egypt, where Mr. Zawahiri rose to prominence during the turbulent years of rebellion against the government, and to Saudi Arabia, where Mr. bin Laden became a hero for his support of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion. In describing his encounters with sources from a wide range of political viewpoints Mr. Wright draws a dispiriting portrait of the ingrained pathologies of both Egyptian and Saudi societies, illuminating the cultural and economic factors that make them a continually rich source for strongly fermented hatreds.That hypnotized chicken is Mr. Wright's bizarre metaphor for Saudi Arabia itself. When he was a kid in Oklahoma, a cousin entertained him by getting dizzied chickens to stand like statues. ''Sometimes the existence in the modern world of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reminds me of that hypnotized chicken,'' he says with a wry smile. ''It's unlikely, it's improbable, it's unnatural -- but there it is.''He is referring to the economic polarities and the extreme repression. The latter is illustrated wrenchingly in anecdotes about a tragic fire at a girls' school (the students were not properly dressed, so they were allowed to burn alive) and how he watched helplessly as a woman reckless enough to expose her face in public was chased down the street by a member of the religious police. (Mr. Wright adds the macabre detail that many of these enforcers of Islam's strict moral codes are ex-convicts who memorized the Koran in prison.)Despite the lack of economic options for its people and a government that steals a hefty percentage of the national income from oil, rebellion has never come to call. Why? Fear of the alternative, Mr. Wright suggests. ''Change does not equal progress in the Middle East,'' he says.Encounters with frustrated young Saudis raise the disturbing notion that the Saudi rulers quietly support the jihad as a convenient way to occupy -- and destroy -- generations of dissatisfied young men itching for something to do. Recounting a conversation with a group of Bedouins, some of whom have been tempted to fight in Iraq, he says, ''They all agree there is a plot on the part of the clergy and their government to eliminate them, the unhappy, unemployed Saudi young men.''Mr. Wright makes no pretense of objectivity about the American reaction to the events of 9/11. He has immediate experience, to begin with, of the new rules on wiretapping: the F.B.I. showed up at his house while he was working on the book to inquire about a few suspicious calls to London.''My Trip to Al-Qaeda'' concludes with the mournful observation that the reaction to 9/11 in the United States has transformed the country in ways that have degraded the ideals it was founded to enshrine. Mr. Wright quotes an enraged Syrian filmmaker who cries, ''When I look at you now, I see us!''''My Trip to Al-Qaeda'' occasionally slips into repetitive generalities, and Mr. Wright can strike a stilted or stale note when he turns polemical. But the firsthand testimony he brings of the misery that is an endless resource for Al Qaeda will be hard to shake from the memory.''Perhaps Al Qaeda can best be understood as an engine that runs on the despair of the Muslim world, especially its young men, whose lives are so futile and unexpressed,'' he observes in one of the evening's more trenchant -- and chilling -- passages. ''Al Qaeda offers them a chance to make history. All they have to do is die.''My Trip to Al-QaedaBy Lawrence Wright, based on his book ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11''; directed by Gregory Mosher; production design by Garin Marschall; production stage manager, Geoffrey Lake; coordinating producer, Julianne Hoffenberg.

Alber Elbaz took to his bed. Editors asked to give their opinions to television cameras had to rev up like a small plane before diving off an Andean cliff. Such were the last brutal days of the fall 2007 collections.It used to be considered a privilege to close the Paris shows, but really how wonderful can it be when half your audience has suitcases of dirty clothes on its mind? Anyway, more than a clear and rested mind would have been necessary to make heads or tails of Miuccia Prada's Miu Miu show, the last of the Paris bunch.She had such a bright youthful collection last season, but this one felt leaden, another of her ugly-beautiful soliloquies on the structure of the feminine suit (full skirt, below the knees), which she rendered in a stiff camel-colored fabric, a pink quilted silk (or blend) and in sheer, iridescent materials.Underneath the transparent looks there were vivid layers, and this, at least, was effective in a lurid way. Accessories included knee socks and two-tone patent leather shoes with a pleated fan of patent up the ankle or across the top of the foot. But despite the vaporous quality of the layers (I am being kind, can you tell?), the suit silhouette was not appealing.Mr. Jacobs, who was a guest at Ms. Prada's show, came up with a serene collection for Louis Vuitton. In colors inspired by the paintings of Vermeer, and given the extra tactile gloss of lam&#233; wool, the clothes had weight and polish, with a standout jacket in deep pink velvet and the lam&#233; skirts in shades of sky blue and bronze-orange.Slim dresses and tops with piles of knitted passementerie on the shoulders were a dull exercise in shape. Far more relevant were the vaguely Japanese looks inspired by masculine dress, notably a black strapless wool top and slim skirt and another skirt that came in a two-tone combination of navy and black with a hint of men's trousers. It was shown with a plain white shirt.Mr. Jacobs's Dutch Masters berets, in alpaca, perforated wool or waxed fur, were adorable. A few had the cocky angle of a newsboy cap. Other accessories included monogrammed totes and bags outlined in wool fleece.The Lanvin show, on Sunday, was exceptional. Alber Elbaz might have left the impression with his extended shoulders and funnel-shape sleeves that he was continuing the futurism of last season. In fact, the style came from dresses that Jeanne Lanvin designed in the 1930s.Yet the collection hummed with a modern sense of vitality and sex appeal, particularly the slim sleeveless dresses or suits in black or navy with zip fronts or a neckline of glossy black fur. Dresses were finished in the back with a simple gathering of fabric from neck to hem, and the soft spill of ruffles on a fuchsia silk shift or an ivory blouse somehow worked with the confident, linear line of the clothes. Everything was shown with patent leather stiletto boots or sin-trap pumps.''I was doing a lot of thinking with this collection but I didn't want it to be intellectual,'' Mr. Elbaz said today by phone from his apartment. The collection was one of the most concrete examples of pure feeling and letting go to come down a runway this season.Azzedine Ala&#239;a, who will present his fall clothes to buyers on Tuesday, has been focused lately on pleating. His obsessions are fascinating; one new technique invariably leads to another. Black boiled wool skirts have squares or narrow channels of black lace that allow glinting flashes of a white cotton petticoat. The lace, by the way, is not an inset; it's knitted into the wool.Waists are small in the Ala&#239;a fashion, with a superwide belt in a leopard print. And last year's influential hourglass coat in crinkly black patent leather now has a cousin: a chic bomber jacket. There is also a steel-blue shearling jacket with a wide fleece collar, which looked great with one of his ventilated knit skating skirts.And today, he was still working on a frothy black dress made from about 200 yards of pleated black lace. While the lace may not have been wide, it was all concentrated in a skirt that barely reached the knee.FASHION REVIEW</text></article><article id="1830928"><summary>William Anderson, Navy Hero, Dies at 85</summary><text>William R. Anderson, who commanded the nuclear-powered submarine Nautilus on its historic cruise beneath the North Pole in August 1958 and who later served three terms in Congress, died Feb. 25 near his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 85.His wife, Patricia, confirmed the death to The Tennessean, a newspaper in Nashville.Commander Anderson and his 107-member crew were hailed as heroes after their Aug. 3, 1958, arrival below the pole, a voyage that fascinated millions who had considered Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'' a fantasy.At a time of rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union over who would first send humans into space, the accomplishment was greeted by banner headlines around the world. When the Nautilus made landfall in Portland, England, after 21 days and 8,146 nautical miles, much of the way under the polar ice, Commander Anderson received word that President Dwight D. Eisenhower had awarded him the Legion of Merit and that his crew members would receive the first Presidential Unit Citation in peacetime.Mr. Anderson made headlines again in 1971 when, as the congressman from a rural, conservative district about 65 miles west of Nashville, he stood on the House floor and rebuked J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for accusing two prominent opponents of the Vietnam War of plotting to kidnap a government official and blow up electrical systems in the Washington area. He termed Hoover's accusations the ''climax'' of ''an outrageous pattern of fear and repression.''Coming from a soft-spoken, moderate Democrat who had long supported the Vietnam War, Mr. Anderson's statement was especially surprising.William Robert Anderson was born on June 17, 1921, in Bakerville, Tenn., a crossroads town with two gas pumps in front of one general store. He was a son of David and Mary M. Anderson. His father sold lumber.Besides his wife, according to The Tennessean, Mr. Anderson is survived by a daughter, Jane Anderson, of Leesburg; and three sons, Thomas, of Leesburg; Michael, of Haymarket, Va., and William, of Orange County, Va. His first marriage, to Yvonne Etzel, ended in divorce.Mr. Anderson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1942 and was assigned to the Navy's submarine school in Groton, Conn.; he qualified for submarine duty within a year. On one of his missions during World War II, his submarine brought supplies to guerillas fighting the Japanese in the Philippines.In 1949, he was assigned to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University of Idaho. But two years later, he went back to sea and, in May 1953, became commanding officer of the Wahoo, a submarine that saw action off Korea.In July 1955, Commander Anderson was named head of the tactical department of the submarine school. He was later assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission's division of reactor development in Washington and became an aide to Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, known as the father of the nuclear Navy. On June 19, 1957, he took command of the Nautilus.Although the Nautilus was never in combat, it was valued as a research vessel. It could reach speeds in excess of 20 knots and, except for the need to restore the crew's food supply, could remain submerged indefinitely.For the Nautilus crew, life was actually smooth sailing. A Life magazine article on Sept. 1, 1958, pointed out that there was a jukebox and a Coca-Cola machine on board; that the temperature inside was 72, and that sunlamps were available to those who became claustrophobic.''It was like the New Jersey Turnpike once we got started,'' Commander Anderson said.Yet navigating under the ice, sometimes 400 feet below it, was unpredictable. Crew members plotted every hole in it, in case of emergency.As the Nautilus inched below the pole, the crew began crowding into its attack center, where Commander Anderson waited, microphone in hand. ''During the last minute,'' the Life article said, ''he made a countdown, concluding 'three two one mark.' Then he said, 'Sunday, 3 August 1958; 2315 Eastern Daylight Saving Time. For the U.S. and the U.S. Navy: the North Pole.' ''Commander Anderson then asked for a moment of silence.After retiring from the Navy in 1962, Mr. Anderson -- without an organization, money or campaign experience -- ran for governor of Tennessee as an independent and lost. But three years later he was elected to Congress as a Democrat.It was in December 1970 that Mr. Anderson criticized Hoover's pretrial attack on two Roman Catholic priests, Daniel J. and Philip F. Berrigan, who were later convicted of destroying draft board records. Mr. Anderson started to have doubts about the Vietnam War as death notices increased among his constituents; doubts rose further after he visited Vietnam in 1970.Mr. Anderson read an article in The Washington Post quoting Hoover as saying, in a closed Senate hearing, that the Berrigans planned to kidnap a government official and hold him hostage to demand an end to bombing in Vietnam and to disrupt government operations by blowing up electrical conduits.In his speech on the House floor, Mr. Anderson said, ''Mr. Hoover has resorted to tactics reminiscent of McCarthyism, using newspaper headlines and scare dynamics, rather than the due process of law.''</text></article><article id="1830929"><summary>Bob Hattoy, who drew w</summary><text>Bob Hattoy, who drew wide attention with a nationally televised speech about AIDS at the 1992 Democratic National Convention and then became a forceful advocate for gay and lesbian issues in the Clinton White House, died on Sunday in Sacramento. He was 56.The cause was complications of AIDS, said Adrianna Shea, special assistant at the California Fish and Game Commission, where Mr. Hattoy was the newly appointed president.''President Clinton learned a valuable lesson when he appointed Bob Hattoy to work in the White House: Never hire a dying man; he has nothing to lose,'' Richard L. Berke wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1993. Mr. Hattoy himself joked that he had gotten the job only because everyone thought he would die in no time.As it turned out, he outlived the Clinton presidency by more than six years.Mr. Hattoy had just learned he had AIDS when he took the stage at the Democratic convention at Mr. Clinton's behest. ''We are part of the American family,'' he said, addressing himself to the incumbent president, George H. Bush. ''And, Mr. President, your family has AIDS, and we are dying, and you are doing nothing about it.''''I don't want to die,'' he said. ''But I don't want to live in an America where the president sees me as the enemy. I can face dying because of a disease, but not because of politics.''His words riveted a nationwide audience. ''Bob Hattoy gave people with AIDS and gays in America hope with that speech,'' said Michael Petrelis, a writer and an activist.At the White House, Mr. Hattoy was an associate director of personnel. But he was a link to a constituency that had never had a vocal advocate in the West Wing. In his own words, he would go out to talk to his constituency, ''bring back the White House's thinking to them, and get beat up for being a sellout.'' Then he would turn around, ''report to the White House and get beat up for being the messenger.''When the new president said he would consider limiting the military deployments of gay and lesbian service members, Mr. Hattoy likened it to ''restricting gays and lesbians to jobs as florists and hairdressers'' in civilian life. He was wrist-slapped for speaking out, but he kept talking.''He was an agitator in the best sense of the word,'' said Richard Socarides, who was a special assistant to Mr. Clinton in charge of gay and lesbian policies. ''Bob often meant trouble, because Bob was never satisfied.''From 1994 to 1999, Mr. Hattoy was White House liaison to the Interior Department. Mr. Clinton also named him to the Presidential Commission on H.I.V./AIDS. He was appointed to the California Fish and Game Commission in 2002 and became its president last month.Robert Keith Hattoy was born on Nov. 1, 1950, in Providence, R.I, the son of a mechanical engineer and a school registrar. He is survived by a brother and a sister.Mr. Hattoy became politically active protesting the Vietnam War; he said he considered politics a form of lifesaving. He dropped in and out of college and worked at Disneyland and for a Los Angeles city councilman. At 28, he found his calling at the Sierra Club, where he worked for a decade on environmental justice and as a regional director for California and Nevada.He joined Mr. Clinton's campaign and became his leading environmental adviser. Then, in June 1992, he learned he had AIDS. A few weeks later, he told the world about it.</text></article><article id="1830937"><summary>Amygdaloids, blues and rock 'n' roll band, is made up of group of neuroscientists from New York University; photos (M)</summary><text>The house lights went up and the blue light from a projector went off as the Amygdaloids prepared to take the stage. They plugged in their instruments, fiddled with knobs and pedals and moved a drum set forward as the previous act, a lecturer on schizophrenia, took his seat.Charts and diagrams on atypical antipsychotics gave way to a blend of blues and rock 'n' roll, and chuckles spread through the crowd Sunday night in the cramped basement of the Cornelia Street Caf&#233; in the West Village for the monthly cabaret called Entertaining Science.''They're the only rock band that is made up of neuroscientists,'' said Roald Hoffman, the host and a Nobel laureate in chemistry. Before the show, he was concerned that the older, science-oriented audience would need cotton balls for their ears.Joseph E. LeDoux, 57, and Tyler Volk, 56, the guitarists and lead singers of the Amygdaloids, met three years ago while writing books on science for laypeople. Mr. LeDoux, a neuroscientist at New York University, specialized in fear in the brain, and Mr. Volk, a professor of biology at N.Y.U., was writing about death.They soon discovered that they shared interests beyond the brain. They both played the guitar.They performed at a neural science department Christmas party in 2005, where they discovered that Daniela Schiller, 34, a postdoctoral student in neuroscience, had been a drummer in a band in Israel. She soon introduced them to a graduate student, Nina Curley, 24, who played bass guitar, and the Amygdaloids were born. The name comes from Mr. LeDoux, a leading authority in neural science, who believes that fear is registered in the amygdala, an almond-shaped part of the brain.''Why, why do we feel so afraid?'' Mr. LeDoux sang on Sunday night. ''Don't have to look very hard, it's all in a nut, in your brain.''The son of a butcher in Louisiana, Mr. LeDoux, who has a doctorate from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, grew up around animal parts and was most interested in the cow's brain.He believes that understanding the brain is vital to understanding the way human beings experience emotions. He has written books for a nonscientific audience, and he hopes the group's music makes neuroscience even more accessible -- not to mention fun.''I considered doing both the lecture and the music, but that was a little too much,'' he said.The band did not seem at all afraid before the show Sunday night, even though there was a special guest in the audience. When asked what he thought of the music, the guest, John Nash, the mathematician who was the subject of the book and movie ''A Beautiful Mind,'' said, ''The music is, I don't know  psychoanalytic?''INK</text></article><article id="1830956"><summary>Dharmachakra Buddhist Center in Maplewood, NJ, is offering Meditation for Moms and Meditation for Kids classes; photo (M)</summary><text>Here is a question worthy of contemplation: Can several suburban mothers sit quietly for an hour and clear their minds of sippy-cup lids that do not fit sippy-cup cups, of toddlers who play drums in full cereal bowls, of soccer shorts gone missing?And let us ponder this, breathing in and out gently: Is it possible for six children, with an average age of 8, to center themselves for two hours on a Saturday morning without the use of a glowing screen, an athletic coach or a sedative?These and far deeper questions are explored weekly at the Dharmachakra Buddhist Center here in Meditation for Moms and Meditation for Kids classes. While they may not provide definitive answers, at least they offer a few hours respite from the business of raising, or being, a child.For the past six months, the center, an offshoot of the Chakrasambara Buddhist Center, which has branches in the five boroughs, has been running such classes in meditation and Buddhist practices, with a special family class available to avoid the need for child care.On Friday morning, Peter Kurczynski, the resident teacher, sat in the lotus position in the front of the center's meditation room, wearing a lapel microphone to amplify his very quiet voice. He guided the four women in attendance to ''contemplate something that brings us joy or appreciation, and abide with that for 10 minutes or so.''''Ten minutes? One thing?'' one woman asked.''Breathe in, and you're really breathing in inner peace, a form of clear light,'' Mr. Kurczynski said, as the rush of traffic could be heard outside. He guided the women step by step to relax faces, backs, shoulders, arms and feet, then suggested a list of causes for joy, like the ability to come together, to travel freely and to enjoy some quiet time.''Please relax your concentration,'' he said after awhile, invoking a verb and a noun often scarce for the average parent.He continued with a lesson in cherishing difficult people, and told a story of Atisha, an ancient Indian practitioner of Buddhism, whose cook was disrespectful and cantankerous. When others offered to trade cooks, Atisha said, ''I need this person; he is my object of patience.''Another guided meditation followed, with Mr. Kurczynski encouraging the women to try to cherish the people who may be stepping on their last nerves.After class, Kathleen Morrow Reilly, who has 9-year-old twins, said meditating had helped her parenting.''Usually I'm so busy doing it, I'm not really thinking, but this does give me a wider scope of the world,'' Ms. Reilly said. ''The way it takes me away from the immediacy of parenting and gives me a broader perspective is very helpful.''She pointed out a picture on the wall, which her son had made in class, using black string to outline a person meditating. He added a pirate's eye patch, for good measure.On Saturday, six ''objects of patience'' came to Danna Hunking's Meditation for Kids class, where she led them in a quiet reflection, taught a lesson, read stories, fed them strawberries and, after another stab at meditating, let them play in a nearby park.Phoenix Moy, 6, from Chatham, put visible effort into keeping her eyes closed, and pointed out Montana Riggs, 10, who took a beat or two longer to relax her concentration.''Good meditating,'' Ms. Hunking said to Montana. When a new student, Cedric Lim, 10, came in, Ms. Hunking explained the gist of the class to him.''It's about being kind and developing love and cherishing others,'' she said. ''Don't worry about it, it's easy. Actually, it sounds easy, but when you try cherishing others, it's harder.''Later, she urged the children to watch themselves when they get angry with family members. She guided the final meditation with slow, carefully chosen words about love for mothers: ''Imagine what that would be like, if we could take that big feeling we have for our mothers and spread it to everyone else in our lives.''Montana's mother, Tori Riggs, said she had come to the center after her daughter requested some spiritual teaching, feeling isolated as one of the few Buddhist children in Colts Neck, 50 minutes away.''She wakes up ready to go,'' Ms. Riggs said. ''She was scared of death, and scared of losing her mom, but now I guess she's a little more connected to everything.''Montana says she meditates about once a week at home, and has used what she learns here to break up a fight between two girls in school.''I said to one, 'Just ignore her if you don't really want to be her friend,' '' she said.</text></article><article id="1830960"><summary>Tom Wolfe, chief concierge at Fairmont San Francisco Hotel, in Frequent Flier column, on some of his flight experiences; photo (M)</summary><text>I spend more time on the road than the average hotel concierge. I founded the American chapter of Les Clefs d'Or, a professional association of concierges, which takes me to meetings all over the world. And when I'm off work, I travel, too. It's my hobby.Other travelers -- and especially business travelers -- take service for granted. But as a professional concierge, I'm obsessive about service.That's particularly true for bad service. Last year, I checked into a historic hotel in Washington for our society's convention. Now, when you have a group of concierges checking into your hotel, you would expect everyone to be on their toes.Not necessarily. As I walked through the front door, I noticed the doorman was chatting with the bellman. They were facing each other, oblivious to what was going on around them. People were arriving at the hotel and being ignored.That's embarrassing. When the service is second-rate, it reflects poorly on the concierge, who is a kind of ambassador for the hotel. I take it very personally.But just as bad service makes me cringe, good service makes me proud.When I started the first hotel concierge desk in the United States at the Fairmont San Francisco back in 1975, I traveled to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong to learn about service. Its concierge, Nino, showed me how it was done, from keeping a logbook to what to wear. When I mentioned that we didn't have any uniforms at our new concierge desk, Nino found a tailor in Kowloon who fitted me with a sharp-looking set of uniforms.''I'll take care of your ride to the airport,'' Nino said when I checked out. A few moments later, a Rolls Royce limousine pulled up to the front entrance. The new uniforms were waiting for me at the terminal.When it comes to service, hotels and the concierges that work for them have their ups and downs. But as a frequent traveler, I find that airlines are on a downward trajectory.I was flying from New York to London recently on -- well, never mind the airline, because it could have happened on any airline -- and I had the good fortune of being seated in business class. At least that's what I thought. For some reason, my seat assignment got mixed up, and I was sent to the back of the plane, to a middle seat surrounded by a family with screaming kids.When I politely asked the flight attendant if he could help me find a place to hang my jacket, he snapped, ''We don't have any room for your jacket.''A few moments later, another crew member came to the back of the plane wearing an apologetic expression. Seems they had discovered the error and were switching my seat -- to first class.The snippy flight attendant appeared next to me a moment later.''Mr. Wolfe,'' he said. ''May I take your jacket for you?''FREQUENT FLIER E-mail: elliott@nytimes.com.</text></article><article id="1830965"><summary>This Air</summary><text>ADVERTISING and eyeballs were two nouns linked in my mind well before Internet marketers started spouting them. I always associate them with the reference in ''The Great Gatsby'' to the dilapidated billboard with the all-seeing eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg -- an image that literature professors swoon over, but which I tend to ascribe to F. Scott Fitzgerald's probably sipping immoderately from a flask of whiskey while spotting an actual abandoned billboard on a drive to Long Island Sound.This, however, brings travel into the mix. Advertising, eyeballs and travel. Somebody has figured out that those three concepts are linked every time we get on an airplane. And now, perhaps inexorably, the spirit of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg's eyeballs peers up from the little billboard of an airline tray table.For a couple of years, tray tables in coach sections of US Airways have carried advertising. After US Airways merged with America West in late 2005, tray tables at coach seats in about 350 airplanes had ads.Initial worries that such advertising would annoy passengers have now been allayed, the airline and its advertising partner say. Research indicates a higher-than-expected number of passengers like and retain messages from tray table advertising, they say.Brand Connections, the New York marketing company that provides the laminated tray table ads for US Airways, plans to expand the ads to first-class seats, starting this spring.According to Travis Christ, the airline's marketing vice president, ads in first class will create ''540,000 new tray table opportunities per month,'' in addition to the 6 million now available each month in coach seats.Many airlines use advertising, but so far only US Airways does so on something as in-your-face as a tray table. Airlines, though, are increasingly placing advertising on napkins, ticket jacket folders, and even air-sickness bags. In Europe and Asia, some small airlines put ads on overhead bins, and a few even have big ads painted on exterior fuselages.Airlines in the United States have been watching the US Airways experiment carefully, said Brian Martin, the 34-year-old founder and chief executive of Brand Connections, which also does advertising and brand promotion in hotel rooms and at outdoor sports sites like ski resorts and golf driving ranges.Thirty-five percent of airline travelers have household incomes over $100,000 a year, nearly double the percentage of the population in general. And passengers on a domestic flight are a captive audience for an average of two and a half hours. Even hard-charging Type A business travelers eventually put aside the laptop or spreadsheets and ''chill,'' Mr. Martin said.''In the past, the only way to reach them was through the in-flight magazine,'' he said. But not many people actually look at the magazine. When they do, he said, they find ad clutter, not a focused message. In-flight entertainment screens sometimes carry ads, but ''there's always another one coming along in 60 seconds,'' Mr. Martin said. Besides, on most airlines, in-flight monitors are difficult to see and the bland, heavily edited movies they offer are easy to avoid.About six months ago, Brand Connections bought a small company, Sky Media, which, he said, had the exclusive North American patent for ''wrapping a tray table'' with a heavy laminated ad. Sky Media had the contract with US Airways.He said Brand Connections was talking with several other domestic airlines about the tray table ads.Both he and US Airways say the ads have generated overwhelmingly positive reaction, primarily because they are all creatively designed to convey information, often with lots of words rather than the heavily attention-seeking graphics associated with magazines. Clients have included Mercedes-Benz, Bose, Microsoft, Bank of America, Verizon and an array of national consumer products.As the ads migrate to the premium seats, many will probably be especially designed for first class, ''geared to reaching executives who can pull the trigger'' on corporate purchases, Mr. Martin said. He said he expected in-flight ads to be eventually integrated into larger campaigns reaching into hotel rooms and airports, sometimes linked to promotional offers and products.Advertisers are increasingly receptive, Mr. Christ said, adding: ''In the beginning, it was difficult to get advertisers to go along because it was nontraditional. The metrics didn't match up to the way they typically measure advertising.''I asked him how far this could go, meaning a captive audience is not just exposed to tray tables -- the whole airplane can be seen as a billboard. And subway cars have been festooned with overhead ads since Teddy Roosevelt was president.''We would draw the line at things like ads on overhead bins,'' Mr. Christ said.ON THE ROAD E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1830967"><summary>Photo of model carrying Luis Vuitton tote during Paris fashion show</summary><text /></article><article id="1830977"><summary>Robert Marsland of Madison, Wis, wins National Vocabulary Championship at New York Public Library; photo (M)</summary><text>Billy Dorminy was perspicuous, talking about poecilonyms on television, and there was nothing pusillanimous about the way he did it.Words, words, words. They were flying inside the main New York Public Library yesterday, where Billy, 16, of McDonough, Ga., was one of 50 finalists in the National Vocabulary Championship, which promised to reward high school students whose strength is verbal acuity with money for college tuition.This is a group that knows what is pulchritudinous and what is pulverulent. This is a group that knows who is ridiculous, who is nidicoulous and who is nidifugous. This is a group that knows what is Brobdingnagian and what is merely colossal.And this is a group that knows what to do when the television cameras are on. GSN, a cable network that carries game shows, turned the library's Celeste Bartos Forum into a television studio, the better to videotape the competition.The host, Dylan Lane, questioned the contestants the way game-show hosts do, making friendly chatter with jittery people who have buzzers in their hands. When Billy's turn came, he told Mr. Lane that he knew a synonym for synonym: poecilonym.He said he had discovered it on a list of words on a Web site. What he did not tell Mr. Lane was that he posted an entry on a different site that begins: ''Hello, my name is Billy Dorminy, and my favorite word is 'poecilonym.' 'Poecilonym' is just a synonym of 'synonym'!''Something else he did not tell Mr. Lane was that he came in fourth in the National Word Power Challenge (''out of the three million participants nationwide'') a couple of years ago.But yesterday, he was outbuzzed by faster competitors and was eliminated in the first round.The GSN crew led him upstairs at the library, where he watched a brief snow flurry through a big window while other contestants parsed and parried downstairs. He said he had a word for what he hoped would fall: graupel. ''A snow pellet that breaks apart when it hits the ground,'' he explained. Which was pretty much the dictionary definition. (It also refers to ''soft hail.'')Leah Libresco, 16, of Mineola, N.Y., advanced to the second round on a question that called for her to choose the word that did not belong among these three: catapult, disrupt and impede. ''I was like, I'm not missing catapult,'' she said. ''PBS did a special on trebuchets. It's a special kind of catapult.'' A stone-hurling medieval engine of war, also spelled ''trebucket.''There were grownups who showed off their vocabularies, or tried to. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, appearing before the taping began, used words not often heard at City Hall: ''coruscating'' (referring to the ''dazzling'' contestants), ''paresthesia'' (to say there was a ''tingling'' in the room), and ''sexagenarian'' (referring to himself).Rich Cronin, the president and chief executive of GSN, said he was not just thrilled to watch the competition, he was also euphoric. ''One person will be the 'American Idol' of vocabulary,'' he said. (In the end, after an afternoon with its share of technical difficulties and dashed hopes, the winner was Robert Marsland, 18, of Madison, Wis. He will receive $40,000 toward college tuition. The winners in the finals and in the earlier citywide competitions held nationwide divided more than $80,000 in tuition money. The Princeton Review, a tutoring and test preparation service, came up with the questions.)Off camera, it took Joel Chiodi, GSN's vice president for marketing, a moment to remember a word he had learned from listening to contestants around the country.''I'll get back to you,'' he said.A moment later, he did.''Penultimate,'' he said. ''It means second to the top, or second best.''But the judges would not have bought that definition. The dictionary says penultimate means next to last.The contestant who finished third was Daniel James Theobald Verdon Thorn of Teaneck, N.J., who said his parents had given him so many names because names were one of the few things they could give him that were free.After advancing to the second round, he said he was impressed by the competition. ''Other people seemed so much better than me,'' he said. ''I had been on a couple of other TV shows with buzzers, so I figured my buzzing skills were up to par.''Micah Jordan, from the Pablo Neruda Academy in the Bronx, had won a citywide competition that earned him his place at the finals. Last week, the school held a pep rally for him. But he was eliminated in the first round.Later, he looked disappointed but said he felt sagacious.''Sagacious comes from sage, which is a wise person,'' he said. ''I've been through it now. I know what to expect the next time.''Mr. Cronin of GSN said he had given Micah some advice. ''Remember Jennifer Hudson didn't win on 'American Idol,' '' he said. ''She did win an Academy Award.''Correction:  March 8, 2007, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about the National Vocabulary Championship for high school students misspelled a word described as one of several that the students would likely know. It is nidicolous, not nidicoulous. (For those of us not in the know, it means: remaining in the nest for some time after hatching, as some birds; or living in the nest of another species.)</text></article><article id="1831002"><summary>Photo of young boxer training at his new gym in Brooklyn; boxing club where he got his start was forced to close</summary><text /></article><article id="1831005"><summary>Defense Dept confirms deaths of five service members in Iraq (S)</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,163 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

Or maybe both, which might be most fitting, since one of Mr. Brisseau's subjects is the volatility of desire, the way the path of erotic curiosity can swerve from satisfaction into recrimination and confusion. A porno-philosopher in the venerable French tradition, he blends a frank appeal to the audience's nether regions with some teasing attention to its mind.''Exterminating Angels'' is seriously dirty -- the only film I can recall seeing at a critics' screening accompanied by the 2257 compliance certificate required of movies that contain unsimulated sex -- and also, in its own windy, Gallic way, perfectly serious.Inspired partly by some legal and personal troubles that followed the completion of an earlier film, ''Secret Things'' (2002), Mr. Brisseau tells the story of a director named Fran&#231;ois (Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Van Den Driessche), who decides to make a film about female eroticism.His ideas on the topic are expressed rather abstractly: a lot of chin-scratching talk about pleasure and transgression that puts you in mind of Freud's chestnut about female sexuality as a ''dark continent.'' But his methods are decidedly empirical. He recruits young women (''the girls,'' he eventually calls them) to participate in screen tests that initially involve masturbating on camera and then progress to hotel room activity &#224; deux and -- pourquoi pas? -- &#224; trois.Not that Fran&#231;ois himself takes part in the action. He's only the director, after all. He stands behind his tripod, looking more puzzled than aroused, as Julie (Lise Bellynck), then Julie and Charlotte (Maroussia Dubreuil), and finally Julie and Charlotte and St&#233;phanie (Marie Allan) wriggle and writhe. Throughout, he insists that his interest is entirely impersonal, and much of his dialogue consists of startled variations on a defensive question: ''Moi?''''I don't want this film to be about my fantasies,'' Fran&#231;ois insists. It seems likely, though, that somebody's fantasies are involved, Mr. Brisseau's, perhaps, or maybe Howard Stern's. In any case, the exertions of the actresses, and perhaps the orgasmic results of those exertions as well, are quite real, though they are also arranged at least as much for the visual pleasure of the viewer as for the physical pleasure of the women.And it is perhaps this disjunction that causes the film's tone to shift from blithe sexual comedy toward the dark melodrama foreshadowed by the title. ''Exterminating Angels'' evokes the name of a film by Luis Bu&#241;uel, and Fran&#231;ois's project is viewed through a scrim of surrealism. The ghost of his grandmother appears from time to time (fully dressed, I should note) to dispense cryptic warnings, and two other specters (Rapha&#235;le Godin and Margaret Zenou) meddle enough to create the impression that they, not Fran&#231;ois, are the agents of his fate.His wife (Sophie Bonnet) warns Fran&#231;ois that he is heading for trouble, and of course she's right. The lesson of ''Exterminating Angels'' -- perfectly sensible, in its way -- is that eroticism cannot be approached with the kind of detachment its protagonist intends. His folly, as he eventually learns at great cost, is to believe that what the women do for his camera has nothing to do with him, and to deny the sexual and therefore emotional connection that binds him to them.But of course this cautionary aspect of Mr. Brisseau's film is undermined, quite deliberately it seems to me, by the explicitness with which he repeats his alter ego's experiment. The women who bared all for the character's gaze also did so for the director's. And also, therefore, for any highbrow voyeur who prefers his skin flicks with subtitles and can judge the sins of the filmmaker without fear of being punished for them.

And it will leave you feeling as distraught as you might if you had missed an especially good sale.This play by Julian Sheppard, at the Flea Theater, has been directed by Adam Rapp, a 2006 Pulitzer finalist for his play ''Red Light Winter,'' but as ambitious as their goals are, they fail to mine any emotional resonance in the myth of the ruined beauty. Mr. Sheppard has centered the drama on a young woman of no apparent ambition (Katherine Waterston), whose show-business aspirant boyfriend, Cary, decides to relocate them from their quiet life in Seattle to the cauldron of Los Angeles in the hope that his head shots will take him further there.Mr. Rapp has staged the play as a series of expressionistic vignettes in which Ms. Waterston's Audrey, whose relationship with Cary is long over by the second scene, meanders with no moral bearing through a Los Angeles of cocaine, broken will and self-annihilating sex with various stereotypes ranging from the pompous screenwriter to the self-important marketing honcho to the emasculated husband of a powerful executive. Mr. Sheppard either has never read Joan Didion's ''Play It as It Lays,'' or has chosen to recycle its ideas insipidly.Had he envisioned the play merely as a piece of social commentary, a meditation on the destructiveness of place, then the results might not be so dispiriting. But Mr. Sheppard believes he has created a character rather than a clich&#233;.''At the heart of 'Los Angeles' is a woman trying to make sense of her life and to figure out how to survive,'' he explains in his program notes. ''This is what I love most about Audrey, despite everything she does and is done to her, despite every failure and failing and self-destruction, she never stops trying to survive.''Ms. Waterston wrings her hands and knocks her knees and does everything she can to try to invest us in Audrey's vulnerabilities, but Mr. Sheppard seems to have no idea what these vulnerabilities are and not a clue about what it is she is trying to survive at.GINIA BELLAFANTETHEATER IN REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831250"><summary>Jonathan Kalb reviews play Blindness, adapted by Joe Tantalo from book by Jose Saramago (M)</summary><text>59E59 Theaters  59 East 59th Street, Manhattan  (212) 279-4200  Through April 8Joe Tantalo, the artistic director of Godlight Theater Company, has a knack for dystopian allegory. His adaptations of ''A Clockwork Orange'' in 2003 and ''Fahrenheit 451'' in 2006 were surprisingly sharp-edged, breathing vivid theatrical life into sprawling material on tiny stages. Now he has turned his talents to ''Blindness,'' the best-selling 1998 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese writer, Jos&#233; Saramago, and the results are more mixed.In ''Blindness,'' an apocalyptic tale akin to ''The Plague'' by Camus, an unnamed city is struck with a mysterious epidemic of ''white blindness,'' in which everything goes milky white, not dark. As more and more people succumb, the government panics and confines the blind in a mental asylum surrounded by soldiers ordered to shoot would-be escapees.Left to themselves, the inmates are victimized by hoodlums who hoard scarce food, rape women and commit other outrages. A core group, led by a doctor's wife who has pretended blindness to stay with her husband, eventually gets out and finds its way through the devastated city.In Mr. Tantalo's adaptation, the audience, seated on two opposing banks, watches the action through the white scrim walls of a cell-like space about 25 feet long and 10 feet wide. The milky obscurity constantly recalls the onset of the disease. This gauzy eeriness, along with the claustrophobia of 17 cast members moving about in such confinement, lends immediacy to the vulnerability, fear and desperation in the asylum, though it also feeds a certain predictability after a while.Notwithstanding some rough timing at the preview performance I attended, the acting is generally strong, particularly that of Timothy Fannon as an ineffectually paternal doctor and David Bartlett as an accountant turned thug.The main problem with the piece is that Mr. Tantalo has streamlined the novel's narrative to the point of draining it of moral complexity. The philosophical reflectiveness that Mr. Saramago tucked lightly into his gripping storytelling is largely gone, as is most of the behavior that complicates a simplistic victim-perpetrator dynamic within the asylum. The consequence is a disappointingly ordinary horror-thriller that seems to aspire to more trenchant mystery than it holds.JONATHAN KALBTHEATER IN REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831251"><summary>Jason Zinoman reviews Robert Cucuzza play Confidence, Women!; Ella Bole stars; photo (M)</summary><text>Axis Theater  1 Sheridan Square, off Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village  (212) 807-9300  Through March 17According to the legendary swindler Black Pearl (Ella Bole), criminals have two effective options: the counterfeit game and the mayhem game. The first requires precision and subtlety, while the second, an often bloodier brand of scam, relies on manufacturing a certain kind of havoc. Or as she describes it: ''total vulnerability followed by utter discombobulation.''Like Black Pearl, Robert Cucuzza -- the writer and director of ''Confidence, Women!,'' a New York story about swindles, legends and other flim-flams -- has been known as a master of mayhem (albeit the downtown theater kind). Besides acting in plays by Richard Foreman, the king of controlled chaos, Mr. Cucuzza turned his last play, ''Speed Freaks,'' a nervy cartoon about an epidemic caused by cans of peas spiked with drugs, into a memorable exercise in delirious theatrical anarchy. So it's something of a surprise that this new period piece, set in a brothel at the turn of the 20th century, seems so sedate.Part of the explanation may be that Mr. Cucuzza, a hypnotic performer with a talent for slapstick, didn't write a role for himself, and there's no one in his cast who can really connect with the off-kilter comedy in his writing. It's a story about a group of desperate female con artists looking for a big score. There are several juicy parts, but none of the actors seem interested in taking a bite. As Gwen, Kelsey Bacon is an exception, playing a proper lady interested in investing in the brothel, which is, of course, only one of the play's many hustles.Mr. Cucuzza has his own splintered prose style that takes some getting used to. Depending on the line, his characters might sound like lowlifes from the old-time Bowery, borscht belt comedians or coarse teenagers from a sitcom. At times, the mix of voices creates an appealing, comic dissonance that plays into Mr. Cucuzza's endearingly silly side. He likes words like ''smackeroos,'' puns and pratfalls, which in this production come off as disappointingly formulaic, since each of them inevitably ends up on the same mattress in the corner of the set.Perhaps Mr. Cucuzza is trying to tell us something when he has Black Pearl tell the rest of the con artists: ''Mayhem's a fool's game. They're messy affairs that lend themselves to jacked-up jimmies with a need for speed.'' To which this theatergoer replies, What's wrong with that?JASON ZINOMANTHEATER IN REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831252"><summary>Jonathan Kalb reviews Looking Glass Theater production of Bertolt Brecht play Baal, directed by Charmian Creagle; Jadelynn Stahl stars (M)</summary><text>Looking Glass Theater  422 West 57th Street, Clinton  (212) 352-3101  Through March 25Any production of ''Baal,'' Bertolt Brecht's first play, is an act of courage. Written in 1918 before Brecht became ''Brecht'' -- the sometimes reluctant proxy of a party line -- it is a great play that has offended many people. Among the offended was the author, who, after his turn to Marxism years later, was disgusted by the work's supposedly irresponsible romanticism and rewrote it as a tedious allegory about asocial behavior.Today the risk of offense has more to do with feminism than communism. This is Brecht's most reckless and sweeping view of humanity. The title character, a poet and singer, is a monster of appetite who heedlessly uses, abuses and discards lovers of both sexes, as well as friends, patrons and total strangers.But it's one thing to read heady criticism explaining Baal as a childish demigod, a mythical agent of the death wish, or a symbol of romantic anti-respectability. It's quite another to sit and watch a beefy (and usually greasy and hirsute) actor grope and slap around young and pathetically servile women (his lovers are mostly women) in a detached manner for two and half hours without a hint of remorse or comeuppance.The director Charmian Creagle's interesting response to this challenge was to cast Baal as a woman. Jadelynn Stahl, a clean-cut actress of medium build, plays the role as a sort of archetypal cabaret singer in this Looking Glass Theater production. She wears a white suit and black shirt that she doesn't change (despite the play's various settings and circumstances), although she does strip them off for a few sex scenes. Gender flexibility aside, the main goal here seems to be to frame Baal's rapacity and gluttony as ideas for cool examination rather than as spectacles for mere emotional consumption.As Baal warns at one point, however: ''Don't overrate the head. You need a backside too, and all that goes with it.'' Unfortunately, Ms. Creagle's earnest production presumes that Brechtian ideas carry inherent theatrical force, regardless of felt connections between actors or melodic delivery of the author's gorgeous poetry. Ms. Stahl speaks and sings well but seems lost much of the time, and no discernible sparks fly between her and her intimate partners. The general air of aimlessness is exacerbated by a hodgepodge of musical settings (by the composer and band director Alan S. Hewitt).The nine other actors mug tritely, force accents and brandish silly props without seeming to know what they're holding. Movement about the tiny stage is cramped and inefficient, and the crowd scenes are dreary and indistinguishable. Even by small-budget standards, the design is unimaginative: empty picture frames serving no active purpose on black walls; dully arranged twigs to indicate a forest.Despite the courage, this production fails to convey either the theatrical power or the breadth of soul in this ticklish masterpiece.JONATHAN KALBTHEATER IN REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831253"><summary>Honor Moore reviews Volcano theater company production of Michael Redhill play Goodness; Gord Rand and Lili Francks star; photo (M)</summary><text>Performance Space 122  150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street  East Village  (212) 352-3101  Through Sunday''Goodness,'' Michael Redhill's gripping and important play about genocide, brings to mind Bertolt Brecht, who stripped away theatrical illusion so that the viewer could empathize with human suffering but also observe the cruelty of the historical and social forces that drive our interactions. Brecht's plays were often epic extravaganzas, but ''Goodness,'' with its bare stage and few props, has the intimacy and discordant reach of a late Beethoven string quartet.To begin this production by the Canadian company Volcano, a scruffily dressed actor (Gord Rand) appears, carrying a notebook. He charmingly announces that he is portraying ''Michael,'' the author of tonight's play. Escaping ''a little depression'' he had after his recent divorce, he travels to Poland to find out more about his great-grandparents and their five children, who were murdered in the Holocaust. In London, en route, he meets Althea (Lili Francks), a survivor of an unidentified late-20th-century genocide.''Why do good people rush to do evil?'' Michael wants to know. ''And what do they become?'' The second question is the most daunting for a play, but the clarity of Mr. Redhill's language, the economy of Ross Manson's direction and the excellent cast -- which presented ''Goodness'' last summer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival -- succeed in dramatizing its complexities. A haunting score that the actors sing without accompaniment, based on folk songs from ''as far north as the Ukraine and as far south as Zimbabwe,'' reminds us that genocide knows no nationality.''Rumors take on flesh,'' Althea tells us, ''and then, as if in a fairy tale, we see the torches coming down our street.'' Her storytelling frames the play, in which the cast members enact past events, as perpetrator (Victor Ertmanis), victim (Amy Rutherford), lawyer (J. D. Nicholsen) and Althea's younger self (Tara Hughes).As the story unfolds, Althea challenges Michael's innocence until, in a shocking moment, he understands that he too is capable of murder.But Althea's most important teaching and what gives ''Goodness'' its unusual power is perhaps more disconcerting to a 21st-century audience than any act of violence: only what seems inconceivable -- an act of forgiveness -- can end a cycle of slaughter.HONOR MOORETHEATER IN REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831322"><summary>Critical Shopper column on Roger Vivier, new footwear store for women in New York City; photos (M)</summary><text>SUPPOSEDLY it was Christian Dior, who while working in his atelier with the legendary cobbler Roger Vivier, was moved to coin the word ''footwear.'' ''Imagine discussing Marie Antoinette's shoes!'' Dior was said to have exclaimed. From then on, M. Vivier, when speaking of his creations, never used the s-word again. Or so the story goes.M. Vivier died in 1998, but in the newly opened New York branch of the haute accessories house that bears his name, the exquisitely made wares are displayed in backlit plexiglass niches, more like fine art, than  you know what.Spread over two floors in a landmark building, the store is designed to evoke the eclectic d&#233;cor that Vivier favored in his own homes: a mix of mid-20th-century furniture with silvered mirrors, bronze Buddhas and tribal masks. The result, if slightly masculine, is sophisticated and very French and unlike most of today's gleaming temples to luxury branding, almost cozy. On a day I visited, this hominess was enhanced by the smell of toast mysteriously permeating the second floor; perhaps a sales assistant was enjoying lunch somewhere behind the sable suede walls.When Bruno Frisoni took over as the label's creative director in 2004, he decided not to simply plunder the archives, but to reinterpret the Vivier aesthetic, giving it a contemporary edge while preserving the slightly anachronistic air of semicouture luxury. Vivier invented the stiletto heel and made the emerald-encrusted sandals that Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation, but his greatest success came with the square-toe, black patent pump with a chrome buckle he made for Yves Saint Laurent's 1965 Mondrian collection.Two years later, it was worn by Catherine Deneuve, playing a bourgeois housewife who escapes the boredom of her marriage by working as a prostitute in ''Belle de Jour.'' The shoe was an instant sensation. Mr. Frisoni has adopted its geometric buckle as the house's signature motif.When I first saw Mr. Frisoni's reworking of the iconic pump in the Vivier window, I was struck by its soign&#233;e, aerodynamic grace. Once inside, however, the same shoe is presented in a seemingly eternal array of colors, fabrics and textures (starting at $525). This may be perfect for the Jackie O-style completist shopper: ''I'll take one of everything!'' But it left me thinking, ''Enough buckled s-word, already!''It's in the accessory range that the buckle motif reaches its apogee. It took me a moment to recognize that the gold-plated and black plastic slave bracelets ($650 to $750) all slyly reiterated this shape. And the arms of the big bold sunglasses are molded to appear as if threaded through large gold buckles ($445). The frames, in lacquered black, red, white or tortoiseshell plastic, come in two sizes: D.W.I.-bust large and fleeing-rehab huge.Coordinating with the glasses is a selection of clutches, their hard, glossy casings, in the same cherry or arctic-white plastic, a tantalizing textural contrast to centers of white, black or red stingray ($1,350) or alligator ($2,150). With room for little more than a lipstick, they are expensive, impractical and unspeakably gorgeous.There are more capacious, and affordable, bags, although at Roger Vivier, affordable is not just a relative term, but also a philosophical one. If, like me, you have limited resources yet still consider a quality handbag to be a practical investment in your long-term well-being, you might even find the prices a pleasant surprise.My favorite purse, the Pillow Bag, in silver, gold, red and fawn ($990), was at first glance unprepossessing: a chubby crescent pouch with a short, thick strap. But as I looked in the mirror, its amorphous form nestled into my body like an orphan clinging to Angelina Jolie, its appeal no less plaintive: ''Take me home and love me.''At Roger Vivier much is made of the ''Belle de Jour'' connection. Every fourth style is called Belle-this or Belle-that. And as I made my way through the store, I was struck by how the journey of S&#233;verine, Ms. Deneuve's character, from repression to liberation to final abasement, reflected my own shopping experience.On the first floor, faced with ranks of chic but prosaic flat-buckled shoes, I shared her ennui with a bourgeois asexual existence. As I climbed the stairs, the flat pumps morphed into retro-erotic buckled stilettos with dangerously curved heels ($595 in patent, $695 in water snake). Like S&#233;verine, torn between Catholic guilt and desire, I was tortured by the idea that spending thousands of dollars on a shoe might indeed be a sin. When confronted with the vertiginous Rose Sandal ($1,495), in deepest midnight-blue satin and adorned with a single red vinyl rose, my eyes prickled with shame and longing. But unprepared to start turning afternoon tricks, objects of such obscure beauty must remain beyond my reach.When I crossed the threshold of the second-floor couture salon, I finally grasped, as in the Luis Bu&#241;uel film, the literal and metaphoric cost of unbridled indulgence. Here, V.I.P. clients come to commission custom-made shoes, like a green snakeskin stiletto sprouting raggedy, red voile roses so huge that, given the flexibility, their wearer could with a few high kicks, do the dusting before heading out ($7,900). And Kimono ($16,000), a dead-flat, pointy-toe boot in beaded aqua satin, its price commensurate with the amount of money I'd require to perform the unnatural act of wearing it.As I headed back downstairs, I saw a chic elderly woman wearing mink and a frozen expression being escorted up to the main gallery, exchanging air kisses with various staff members in her perfumed wake. Her voice carried down to me: ''It's so nice to finally be able to buy shoes in New York.''Roger Vivier  750 Madison Avenue (65th Street); (212) 861-5371ATMOSPHERE -- Like visiting the grand apartment of a wealthy but bohemian Parisian.

A sad-looking green tunic sweater from Alexander McQueen, worn over a shiny black body suit, reminded them of Kermit's lament, and that big yellow fox chubby at Emanuel Ungaro would have kept Big Bird from his usual complaints of the shivers.There were feathers dangling from the designs of Olivier Theyskens at Nina Ricci. There were feathers in the models' hair, too, and this after what looked like a few birds had landed on their heads at Jean Paul Gaultier a few days before.It will not be apparent for a season or so what animal rights activists will make of all this. A few of them turned up last week at the shows, where there was hardly a mink stole in sight. There were exceptions, of course, and certainly some rather extravagant use of fur and animal skins at Herm&#232;s, Celine and Christian Dior.But there were inklings of a change of thinking, with some designers tilting ever so slightly toward that of Stella McCartney, who is vocally opposed to animal cruelty. The only creatures to be found in her collection appeared in a pattern of polar bears on a sweater.At Chanel, a similar motif turned up on sweaters that showed penguins &#224; la ''Happy Feet,'' and during a preview of his show, the designer Karl Lagerfeld pointed out that his latest croc clutches were actually made of jersey sewn to look like reptile skin.''It's eco-friendly Chanel,'' he said, though you got the feeling of a wolf in sheep's clothing.Front Row</text></article><article id="1831327"><summary>Hugh Johnson, longtime skier and snowboarder, tests latest in high-tech sleds; photos (M)</summary><text>SLEDDING has gone high tech.

But sales of performance sleds have been brisk this season, said Peter Kearns, an assistant product manager at Eastern Mountain Sports in Peterborough, N.H.Mad River Rocket, a sled maker in Warren, Vt., has seen sales increase ''at least 25 percent a year'' since 2000, said Jesse Reneau, the vice president.Hugh Johnson, 40, a longtime skier and snowboarder who reports on snow conditions for Smugglers' Notch Resort in Vermont, tested five sleds on groomed trails as well as on fresh powder. The tests took place at the resort, one of about five that rents Airboards.YISHANE LEE</text></article><article id="1831329"><summary>Michelle slatalla Online Shopper column on what sites offer topiaries; drawing (M)</summary><text>THE best way I know to describe the biological urge to garden against all odds is to tell the story of my father and his tulips.Picture Chicago in late autumn. A bitter wind rolls off the lake. We rake leaves in gloves and knitted face masks with narrow eye slits. The first snowstorm may hit by Halloween.And yet at the edge of the yard kneels my father with his trowel, wearing pads to protect his knees as he digs holes for as many bulbs as he can get into the ground before it freezes solid.A few months later hundreds and hundreds of tall red tulips bloom spectacularly. It is a beautiful day. Birds sing. Cars stop at the curb, and their passengers snap Polaroids of the showiest spring garden in town.The next day an April snowstorm hits. The tulips drown in white, and that is the end of the show, until the next autumn. As a bitter wind rolls in from the lake, my father heads for the garden, carrying a large burlap sack of bulbs.Didn't he learn anything from last year?''Yes,'' he said. ''This time I'm planting some yellow ones, too.''I inherited my father's biological urge to garden. And so here I sit, huddled in a sweater in Northern California as a late winter rainstorm lashes the windows. And yet it's all I can do to keep myself from rushing out to visit local nurseries and violate all the rules about how early to start planting.Luckily, the rules have some loopholes. One is called topiaries. Now is actually a good time to get hold of a wire frame and to start coaxing ivy or other plants to grow over it to create a green living sculpture that can stay indoors until the weather warms up.''We're seeing them more and more,'' said Virginia Hayes, a divisional merchandise manager at Smith &amp; Hawken, which has begun selling topiaries online. ''If you take care of them, as they get older, they get better and better looking.''Topiaries have plenty of benefits. They are low maintenance and can endure both indoor and outdoor climates. Which explains why the sculptures have been popular with gardeners since Roman times, when shrubs were painstakingly pruned and clipped into obelisks and balls.Bunny shapes came later. So did such amusing possibilities as topiaries shaped like puppies or teddy bears ($89 each at Smithandhawken.com). While tulip is a tulip is a tulip is a tulip, topiary can be a wreath or a star or, in the case of one I bought last year, a bird cage in which sit two little birds made of moss.Last week on the Internet, at Sk703top.com I could even have bought a topiary shaped like a great Dane ($68 to $108, depending on whether I wanted the frame to arrive planted). And Etopiary.com had a large, flamingo-shape frame ($55), reminiscent of pink lawn ornaments.The only thing that stopped me from buying a topiary menagerie was my husband, who warned, ''Don't get carried away with the animal motif unless you want the house to look like some scary amusement park from the 50s.''For more classical tastes -- like his -- I saw topiaries shaped like cones and balls at Gardenwinds.com (although my husband might not go for the $249.99 triple ball shape, which reminds me of a Dr. Seuss drawing).It can be cheaper to start from scratch. I could assemble my own topiary after buying the frames at Yardiac.com (yes, I am drawn to the site's many rabbits, snails and frogs; I can't help myself) at $24.95 to $39.95, depending on size. A wide variety of plants to grow on the rabbits, snails and frogs is available at Marysplantfarm.com, which has a downloadable catalog offering more than 50 types of hedera helix (ivy) starting at $2.50 a pot. (Orders must be e-mailed, faxed or phoned.)At Marysplantfarm.com, I looked over the list, which included Pixie, Silver Queen, Thorndale, Lemon Swirl and Itsy Bitsy. Who knew there were so many ivies? And when it comes to choosing one to use in a topiary, are they all created equal?''Absolutely not,'' said Suzanne Pierot, the president of the American Ivy Society, reached by phone at home in upstate New York. ''Most people have little topiaries, so they need little vines to put on them. If you hang on, I have a list here.''In fact she wrote the list. Ms. Pierot created an eight-category system for classifying about 500 types of ivy by their leaf shape. (The full list of categories, with accompanying photographs, can be found at the society's Web site, Ivy.org).''I never realized that ivy leaves came in so many different shapes,'' I said.''The ones that work best on small topiaries are miniature ivies like Spetchley and Duck Foot and Midget,'' Ms. Pierot said. ''If you have a bigger topiary, like what you put outside the front door, you can mix more than one kind of ivy, and you can use Bird's Foot ivies, like Needlepoint, Ritterkreuz or Shamrock.''Shamrock is the society's ivy of the year, honored both for its appearance -- for what the description on Ivy.org calls ''leaves of mostly three rounded lobes of near equal size'' -- and for its personality. (''This well-behaved ivy is equally suited as a houseplant, where it does well as a pot plant or topiary, or as an outdoor ivy.'')Ivy isn't the only plant you can use to create a topiary. Boxwood, rosemary and even creeping fig will work well, too.''But ivies, they are a vining plant that is very forgiving,'' Ms. Pierot said. ''Move them into any position you like on the frame, and they will behave. And if you really want instant gratification, which so many of us like these days, find a larger plant in a pot and start with that.''She made it sound so easy that I was tempted to buy a topiary for my father. But these days he doesn't need anything extra to clip and trim during winter. He now lives in Arizona, where it's all he can do to keep plants like the monster bougainvillea and the rosemary-gone-berserk from taking over the place.Has he learned anything from this?''I miss tulips,'' he said.Online Shopper E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1831330"><summary>Nike is introducing new basketball uniform that has taut, body-fitting jerseys that tuck seamlessly into baggy shorts; photo (M)</summary><text>WHEN Syracuse took the floor yesterday at Madison Square Garden for a Big East tournament game against Connecticut, the Orangemen were suddenly fashion plates. They were wearing a new design in basketball uniforms: taut body-fitting jerseys seamlessly tucked into baggy shorts.The players looked buff. You could see their pecs.Today, the Arizona Wildcats will follow suit, literally and figuratively, and tomorrow the Ohio State Buckeyes will also be wearing the new Nike System of Dress during tournament games.More than 20 years after Michael Jordan first adopted longer shorts and over a dozen since Chris Webber, playing as part of Michigan's Fab Five, made baggy pants the fashion in basketball, Nike is hoping that basketball teams are ready to take up a new look: haute techno-athletic on top, hip on the bottom.Nike, which has persuaded four teams to try out the uniforms -- the Florida Gators wore them once, on Feb. 27, and lost to Tennessee, 86-76 -- said it was merely picking up on existing trends.''Basketball works in lockstep with the music and entertainment culture, specifically hip-hop,'' said Hans George, Nike's general manager of global basketball apparel. ''Hip-hop is growing up. It's becoming more businesslike.''Patricia Mears, deputy director of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, said Nike's look may be more old-school than futuristic.''It's probably true that the pants take their cue from the hip-hop look,'' she said, ''but the overall silhouette also reminds me of men's casual sportswear from the mid-century. Often, American men donned sleek tops and tucked them into pleated full-cut trousers.''But beyond style, the new outfits are supposed to be more functional. Mr. George and some of the athletes say that because the jersey is body-fitting and made of two synthetics, Sphere and Dri-FIT, it will better wick out moisture. And by eliminating 10 inches of fabric from the waist, where it bunches up, players have a cleaner look, said David Egelhoff, the director of men's basketball operations at the Ohio State University.Yet, Daryl Gross, the athletic director at Syracuse, said its greater impact may be on the game. ''You can't grab the jersey,'' he said.The pants, though, are still long, loose and lightweight. And that is the way the players like them, Mr. Egelhoff said. ''When Michael Jordan entered the N.B.A. in the 1980s, he got away from the 6-inch-long shorts, and that's what the guys still like,'' he said.Kevin Willis, who played in the N.B.A. from 1984 to 2005, and is also a fashion designer in Atlanta, said Nike's new design might work for college players, but not for the N.B.A.''The guys in the league are a little older,'' he said, ''and everybody doesn't have that sexy build. They're not going to highlight every little part of their body. But in college, they want to set the tone.''Nike has started selling the form-fitting jerseys ($75) and shorts ($60) at the campus stores of the four colleges where players have pioneered them. The company will roll out the new court fashions at Niketown stores and other sporting goods shops this week.The Gators, last year's college basketball champions, have not worn the uniform since they lost to Tennessee last week.Fred Demarest, the sports information director at Florida, said he did not think the new attire hurt the team's performance.''I don't think it's the uniforms that affected their playing,'' he said. ''The other team did.''</text></article><article id="1831336"><summary>Room to Improve column on where to find sophisticated, convertible children's furniture; photo (M)</summary><text>Q. I once saw a crib that converted to a bed with a desk, but can't find it. Can you help?A. Also known as harlequin, metamorphic and meubles &#224; surprises, convertible furniture has been with us for longer than you might imagine. Eighteenth-century military men crossing uncharted lands traveled with amazingly versatile furnishings known as campaign furniture, which could be broken down and reassembled with relative ease, and often had multiple uses. Some homeowners in the 18th and 19th centuries even rejoiced in presto-chango oddities like a sofa that folded out of the front of an artificial player piano.Sophisticated convertible children's furniture, however, seems a more recent development, and the crib-to-desk model you describe is an even rarer (but welcome) instance of the genre.Perhaps you are remembering the Studio crib by TRUCK Product Architecture. The Studio crib, above, was created as part of a four-piece line of children's furniture introduced this year by Nurseryworks, which offers furniture that even a grown-up could covet. Made of pale but handsomely striped zebrawood, offset with colorful lacquer (the rails and storage drawer are enameled in citrus, cotton candy, lime, navy, slumber yellow or snow) the Studio crib has an adjustable changing tray at one end that flips down.As a child gets older the changing pad can be removed and the tray used as a desk; the hidden storage cabinet can be packed with coloring books and crayons. Remove the side rail and crib base and the piece can be a toddler bed. It can be converted into a daybed as well, which extends its life span.All this innovation doesn't come cheaply, though. The Studio crib is $1,780; the daybed converter kit is $250 extra. A list of stores that carry the crib and other nursery furniture is at nurseryworks.net or (888) 508-9540.Q. Where can I find a mirror to hang over a corner sink?A. Several manufacturers have tackled this problem, most of them from a modern viewpoint.The wall-mounted Novella corner mirror by Porcher is 11 3/4 inches wide by 38 1/8 inches high by 11 3/4 inches deep and opens to reveal a medicine chest with frosted-glass shelves. The mirror and shelves are mounted within a pale cherry wood body that has a rounded open shelf at the bottom. It is available online for about $830. Store locations are at porcher-us.com.One of my favorites is the Corner mirror designed by Ludovica and Roberto Palomba for the Work in Progress collection of Ceramica Flaminia, an Italian firm noted for its minimalist bath products. Incredibly sleek (sort of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''), the mirror has an integral rectangular light at the top. It is 31 1/2 inches tall by 161/3 inches wide by 11 5/8 inches deep and costs $1,113. It can be ordered from Lacava at (312) 666-4873 or lacava.com.Much less costly is a stylish corner medicine chest from Renovator's Supply (model 13520). It comes in brushed or polished stainless steel. The measurements are 23 5/8 inches tall by 11 7/8 inches wide by 6 7/8 inches deep, and it costs $199. Information is available from Renovator's Supply at (800) 659-2211 or rensup.com.Traditionalists might prefer the Neptune corner mirror by Herbeau (model 1205), which is designed to hang in a corner and does not open or have shelves. The country-French-meets-rococo china frame is painted with rustic floral motifs. Depending on the finish, it costs $1,072 to $1,180, although some online sources offer it for less. It measures 18 7/8 inches tall by 12 1/4 inches wide by 2 inches deep. Information is available from Herbeau at (239) 417-5368 or herbeau.com.</text></article><article id="1831337"><summary>Andree Putman, interior designer, is overhauling Boca Raton Resort and Club in Boca Raton, Fla; photos (S)</summary><text>Sunny makeovers have been part of the mood magic of Boca Raton, Fla., since the self-taught architect Addison Mizner whipped the resort out of bare beach sand in the '20s.

Tiny irises and hydrangeas and hyacinths, Johnny-jump-ups and fragrant roses, too, all cavorting simultaneously -- a feat not remotely possible in nature, but the Philadelphia Flower Show has always been more dreamscape than landscape. Case in point: the blooms are joined for the 2007 show by dinosaurs with a Hollywood pedigree, some towering fake trees and leprechauns.Going to the flower show -- that venerable, endearing extravaganza, the biggest, most elaborate flower show in the country -- is something like going to the circus. It's a beloved civic tradition, a provincial delight, predictable and unpredictable, and just what is needed at the precise moment of its arrival. You go because you need a lift in a dreary season, because you have had it with winter and are drumming your fingers in anticipation of spring, impatient to get into your garden if you're a gardener, and even if you're not, glad for the diversion of the annual sensorama.As with the circus, you can count on seeing many of the acts you have seen before, presented by the local commercial nurseries. The themes are loose, chosen, it seems, mostly just for the heck of it. For this show it's ''Legends of Ireland.'' Hence the leprechauns.Each time you go, you marvel and wonder, ''How did they do that?'' And perhaps, ''Why on earth would anyone spend that much time and energy to create such an elaborate fantasia that comes and goes in the space of a week and a day?''My children grew up with the circus; I grew up with the flower show. My mother, a serious gardener who lives outside Philadelphia, would spend the months leading up to it plotting tableaus with her garden club cronies and prepping her windowsill begonias for the horticulture contests. Eventually she became a volunteer official (the event, put on since 1829 by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, is in large part a volunteer effort), but she passed the baton on that duty a while back.She missed it, and both of us sorely needed a dose of spring, so she joined me for an early walk-through. The show, which opened March 4 and runs through the weekend at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, was mostly in place by then, but there were still piles of fragrant mulch and rolls of sod to be spread in anticipation of the 250,000-some visitors who jockey for prime spots by the miniatures, bend down to breathe in the hyacinths and look for ideas to apply in their own backyards.My mother's proclivity is for the more scholarly exhibitions, including those put on by societies dedicated to specific plants -- African violets, ivy, cactus, wildflowers and ferns. I was more in the mood for the showstoppers, so we began at the J. Franklin Styer Nurseries exhibit near the entrance, with its wild, spiky plants, dinosaur models once used in a touring promotion for the movie ''Jurassic Park'' and a primordial bog covered with an eerie mist.We lingered longer by the ancient forest floor, the creation of the show's guest designer, Christopher Woods, the director of the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver. Two sections of the forest flanked the entrance, marvels of scale. I was completely won over when my eye fell upon a tiny faerie house fashioned from a bit of decaying log, with four-inch-high milk bottles outside a little painted wooden door. Look closely: a whole colony of faerie houses are scattered about.My mother, meanwhile, was taken with the leaf litter. Fallen brown oak leaves had been layered lovingly about. She pointed to the Queen Anne's lace. ''It's been getting a bad rap lately,'' she said. ''It's not native, and it grows anywhere.'' We agreed that, scourge or not, it was still pretty. Elsewhere, a dandelion, of all things, had been painstakingly planted to look as if it had sprouted on a path.More manly fantasies awaited. The enterprising Men's Garden Club of Philadelphia has constructed a whole landscaped village street, with the requisite Irish pub. Burke Brothers Landscape Contractors created an idyllic putting green, antique-wheeled bag and clubs at the ready. I leaned in to examine the thoughtfully labeled cranberry cotoneaster and heard what sounded like a long, loud burp. The intent, apparently, was to replicate the swish of a golf swing and the sound of a disturbed frog.Some elements are gaudy in the extreme, including a huge knot garden made with glittery colored glass shards, topped by an outsize harp. There is a pot of gold, several rainbows, the aforementioned leprechauns, live music and dancing by a troupe called Ragus and plenty of overgrown ruins.The American Ivy Society hewed closely to the theme, exhibiting only hederas that come from Ireland or have an Irish name. The ivy was less showy than it might have been had they gone farther afield, the society member standing by the display informed us, somewhat apologetically. Irish ivy is mostly (surprise) green. A nice poet's corner nearby offers nature-inspired verse by poets including Seamus Heaney and Yeats.Other exhibitors threw the whole Irish thing overboard. One such tableau worth seeking out is ''Gauguin's Bedroom,'' an entry in the container-displays category by the Chester County Art Association, a South Seas-ish scheme in which languid exotic plants fill every space not occupied by a small four-poster.The Horticultural Society takes its teaching mission seriously, and there's plenty to learn if you make it past the dinosaurs and pots of gold. Handy tips are sprinkled throughout, like one that says: ''Plants that bloom in the spring should be divided in the fall. Those that bloom in the fall should be divided in the spring.'' Old news to hard-core gardeners, but a good take-away for the legions of novices the society hopes to inspire.The Philadelphia Flower Show runs through Sunday at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets. Thursday and Friday 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Saturday 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $24 weekdays; $26 weekends.

I want to use trumpet vine leaves for pressed flower designs, but hesitate to grow a plant I know is invasive. Is there a way to restrain it and if not, is there something else with similar leaves?A. The native trumpet vine, Campsis radicans, does not flower well until quite large, so it is not considered a good candidate for container growing.But for you, a potted trumpet vine could be a winner. It would provide plenty of leaves; roots could not spread; and if flowers did form, they could be removed before making potentially troublesome seeds.That said, there are also many alternatives, assuming that by ''similar leaves'' you mean the featherlike wands of stemmed leaflets known as compound pinnate leaves.Choices include elderberry, sumac, walnut, ash and locust. Or you might stretch out a bit with cup-and-saucer vine, Cobaea scandens, a tropical perennial grown as an annual in most of the United States.This vine is almost obscenely vigorous, growing 15 or more feet in a season. Its compound leaves, strung with oval leaflets, end in graceful tendrils that should look beautiful pressed.And the long-stemmed flowers are spectacular: wide white trumpets that age to deep purple (the cups), sitting on a broad green calyx (the saucer).C. scandens takes about four months to flower from seed, so plan accordingly if you want blooms. Seeds and plants are sold by Select Seeds, (800) 684-0395 or selectseeds.com. Seeds for both purple and white forms are sold by Comstock, Ferre &amp; Company, comstockferre.com or (860) 571-6590.Grass a Mass? Give It Some AirQ. Our landscaper is offering spring lawn aeration. Should we go for it?A. When lawns are compacted through heavy use, or are being strangled by thatch, aeration will improve grass root health by opening the soil to air and water.To assess need, look at the grass roots. If they are less than two inches long, aeration is wise. But you can also just say yes; even if it does little good, aeration will not harm an established lawn.This applies only to core aeration, which removes and spreads small plugs of soil. Spike aeration, which simply punches holes, seldom does anything but increase compaction.</text></article><article id="1831364"><summary>Paul Secon, who helped found Pottery Barn chain, dies at age 91; photo (M)</summary><text>Paul Secon, who in 1949 loaded the family station wagon with discontinued and slightly damaged ceramics from an upstate New York factory, drove to Manhattan and opened the first Pottery Barn store, died Feb. 24 at his home in Rochester. He was 91.The death was confirmed by his brother, Morris, who helped load the car and start the chain.Although the Secon brothers eventually opened seven Pottery Barns, including three in Manhattan, they never quite made a fortune from their enterprise.''When I left the business, we called it the Poverty Barn,'' Morris Secon said in a telephone interview Tuesday. He managed the chain for several years after his brother left the business in 1966. ''We were two kids playing store; we made a living,'' he said.In 1968, Morris Secon sold his share to two partners whom he had brought into the business. They, in turn, sold the company to Gap, which in 1986 sold it for $6 million to Williams-Sonoma. There are now 197 Pottery Barn stores in the United States and Canada, selling furniture, bedding, rugs, lighting products and decorative accessories.When the 12-foot-wide, 110-foot-long original store opened on 10th Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets, the product line was more limited: platters, plates, pitchers, cups and saucers that were nicked or slightly misshapen.Morris Secon had seen the opportunity when his wife returned from a yard sale in Rochester with a dozen pieces of stoneware produced by Glidden Parker, a noted designer, at his factory in Alfred, N.Y. She had paid less than a dollar for each piece. Morris Secon spoke with Mr. Parker and found out that there were three barns filled with products that could no longer be sold to upscale stores.For $2,500, the Secon brothers bought 2,500 pieces of stoneware. For $35 a month, they rented the store.Paul Secon was born in Philadelphia on July 13, 1916. Besides his brother, he is survived by a son, Lucas, of London. Mr. Secon was a magazine writer in Manhattan when his brother proposed that they open the store. In 1952, an article in The New Yorker mentioned that people could buy good-quality, if slightly flawed, ceramics at the Pottery Barn; it started a rush.In 1954, a second Pottery Barn opened on the ground floor of a large space on 10th Avenue, near 24th Street. The 1955 Christmas season was so successful ''that customers had to wait upstairs until their numbers were called so the crush on the first floor would not turn into a stampede,'' a 1963 New York Times article said.By the mid-1960s, Mr. Secon was touring factories around the country and in Europe to find products that met his specifications.''You can't sell people anything you don't like yourself,'' he said.</text></article><article id="1831392"><summary>Defense Dept confirms deaths of six service members in Iraq (S)</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,171 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

But he has yet to travel this year to early voting states, build an extensive political organization or begin raising money to the degree other candidates have.Mr. Hagel, whose second term in the Senate ends next year, could also announce his intention to seek re-election or to leave politics. His spokesman, Mike Buttry, declined to elaborate on the announcement, which is scheduled for Monday morning at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.If Mr. Hagel seeks the presidency, his candidacy would inject into the Republican contest the strongest conservative voice of criticism over the Iraq war. Whether such views would win support in a Republican primary remains an open question.Through a spokesman, Mr. Hagel declined to comment on Wednesday. But in an interview last month, he said he believed there was room in the Republican race for someone with his views on foreign policy, immigration and other issues.''You've got a very unhappy country here,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''It isn't just the war; it's a lot of things. There will be a lot of twists, turns and bends in this process before either party becomes close to deciding who they want to represent them as their presidential candidate.''Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, has been on the opposing side of the Iraq debate. Yet Mr. McCain said Wednesday that he and Mr. Hagel remained close friends.''Chuck is an American hero and a person who I love dearly, and I'll look forward to being with him out on the campaign trail,'' Mr. McCain said in an interview.Asked to assess the dynamics that Mr. Hagel and his views on Iraq would add to the presidential race, Mr. McCain said: ''I don't know what effect it has, to be honest with you. I wish I did.''</text></article><article id="1831437"><summary>People of Northern Ireland express desire to move beyond its scarred, fighting past as they go to polls to elect new assembly; photo (M)</summary><text>Every new development is a historic turning point in the politics of Northern Ireland, except when it isn't. Deadlines come and go. Progress creeps along, stalls, then sputters back to life.So voters who went to the polls here on Wednesday in an effort to resurrect the deadlocked political process had no illusions that they had reached the final chapter in their long and complicated story. They just believed, many said in interviews, that the time had come, finally, for Northern Ireland to move beyond its scarred, fighting past.''We've just got to get things up and running again so we can address the things that really matter to people -- schools, employment,'' said Linda Baker, a 48-year-old sales clerk at a linen store on the Shankill Road, the city's Protestant stronghold. ''The majority of people on this road would have the same view. It has to move on if it's going to get any better.''Wednesday's election is meant to decide what Northern Ireland's 108-member assembly will look like: how many members will be from unionist parties (Protestants who favor closer ties with Britain) and how many from nationalist parties (Catholics who favor a united Ireland).But the assembly has not held a session for five years, since it was suspended during a great cloud of sectarian squabbling. Wednesday's vote is one in a series of intricate steps meant to restore the assembly and with it Northern Ireland's ability to govern itself.But for that to happen, the unionist and nationalist parties, traditional enemies, have to agree to share power in a governing executive. Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party, says it has shown its good will by accepting the destruction of weapons belonging to the Irish Republican Army and by endorsing a plan for a reconstituted police force.But Sinn Fein's moves have alienated some members of its own party, who argue that it has already given up too much. And it remains to be seen whether the concessions are enough to satisfy the unionists, especially the Rev. Ian Paisley, the fierce leader of the Democratic Unionists, the largest Protestant party.The British and Irish governments, which have been prodding Belfast's politicians to make up and move on, have set a deadline of March 26. If no government has been formed by then, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has warned, the assembly will be disbandedBrian Feeney, chairman of the history department at St. Mary's University College here, said he believed that Mr. Paisley would agree to share power with the republicans, despite opposition from Protestant fundamentalists within his party.''The two governments are putting enormous pressure on the Democratic Unionists because Tony Blair wants this up and running as a legacy for his 10 years in power,'' Mr. Feeney said in an interview. ''He will not let Ian Paisley stand in his way.''In another potential stumbling block, Mr. Paisley's party says it will not agree to enter the new government unless Britain accedes to a series of financial demands for Northern Ireland, including a substantial cut in the corporate tax rate. ''We are making this a deal breaker,'' said Jeffrey Donaldson, a senior Democratic Unionist Party negotiator.Pushing a shopping cart in the Kennedy Center mall in Upper Falls, the center of republican Belfast, Julie-Anne Bailey, 43, said the issues dividing the parties had become almost beside the point. ''In the 1970s and 1980s, people here were categorized by how republican they were,'' she said. ''You were either at the rallies or out on the road banging your bin lids together, or you weren't. But people are not so aggressive any more. The talk is not all fighting talk. And now it's O.K. to say, 'We don't want to be fighting all the time.' ''In many ways, Belfast has moved on so much that it is almost unrecognizable. The notorious Andersonstown police barracks in Upper Falls has been demolished, the space now an empty lot. The walls are decorated by a republican mural and a campaign poster referring to perhaps the biggest issue in Wednesday's election: London's threat to make people in Northern Ireland pay water bills.The city center, once virtually an armed fortress, is now a thriving place of fancy hotels, nightclubs and museums. ''Politics used to be really important to people, but now they have had a taste of what peace is like,'' said Roy McDonnell, a 39-year-old businessman who was shopping with his wife, Paula, on Lisburn Road, booming with fancy new stores. Mr. McDonnell comes from a republican family -- his uncle was an I.R.A. member who served 12 years of a life sentence in prison -- but says his own 15-year-old daughter could not care less about politics.His wife agreed. ''We will never move on till both sides move on together,'' she said. ''There's a lot of hurt on both sides, but people are getting fed up with having an assembly that fails all the time. We don't want any more stumbling blocks. If it breaks down this time, God help us.''</text></article><article id="1831444"><summary>John R Ryan will resign as chancellor of State University of New York in May to lead small nonprofit organization (M)</summary><text>John R. Ryan, chancellor of the State University of New York, announced yesterday that he would step down at the end of May to lead a small nonprofit organization.His resignation was unexpected, even though Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said he will rethink the public higher education system in New York and is expected to reshape SUNY.''I really was surprised,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, president of SUNY's Stony Brook campus on Long Island. ''Nothing had created expectations of his stepping down this year.''Reached by e-mail yesterday evening, Chancellor Ryan said his decision ''was not easy'' because he loved SUNY's mission and people. He said he wanted to spend more time with his wife after being away from home at least 15 days each month for the last three years. ''I am not complaining,'' he said, ''but it is also not something I wanted to sustain for another three or four years.''Governor Spitzer said in January that he planned to appoint a commission on public higher education. Christine Anderson, the governor's press secretary, called Chancellor Ryan a ''person of integrity'' who helped the university system through a difficult time'' and had not been pushed to resign.The resignation gives the governor an opportunity to put his mark on SUNY, the largest public university system in the country with more than 400,000 students, though he does not yet control its board. The governor names 15 of SUNY's 16 trustees and designates one as chairman, but there are no vacancies now. (The 16th trustee is a student.)Ms. Anderson said the deputy secretary for education, Manuel Rivera, would work with SUNY's trustees to select a new chancellor.A former vice admiral in the Navy who came to SUNY in 2002 to lead its Maritime College, Chancellor Ryan is credited with raising morale at the university and fighting for its interests, after the contentious tenure of Robert L. King. Mr. King, a close ally and former budget director of Gov. George E. Pataki, was sometimes accused by faculty members and administrators of putting the governor's interests ahead of SUNY's.After he leaves SUNY, Chancellor Ryan, 61, will become president and chief executive of the Center for Creative Leadership, a research and education group in Greensboro, N.C.</text></article><article id="1831445"><summary>NASA fires Capt Lisa M Nowak, astronaut acccused of attacking romantic rival for affections of fellow astronaut; she will return to Navy (S)</summary><text>Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, accused last month of attacking a romantic rival for the affections of a fellow astronaut, was fired from NASA on Wednesday, agency officials said.According to a NASA statement. Captain Nowak was dismissed because the agency ''lacks the administrative means to deal appropriately with the criminal charges'' against her.Were she a civil servant, NASA would have had the choice of placing Captain Nowak on administrative leave without pay or indefinite suspension until the charges are resolved, a NASA spokesman said. But because she was an officer, those options were not available.Instead, Captain Nowak will return to the Navy.James Hartsfield, a NASA spokesman, said the termination of Captain Nowak, who has been charged with attempted kidnapping, ''does not reflect any position by NASA'' on the criminal case against her.Mr. Hartsfield added that he believed it was the first time NASA had asked the military to take back an astronaut. It is also the first time an active-duty astronaut stands accused of committing a felony.Captain Nowak, a Navy veteran who flew aboard the space shuttle last year, drove more than 900 miles on Feb. 5 wearing a diaper to avoid having to stop to use the bathroom and confronted Capt. Colleen Shipman of the Air Force in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport, attacking her with pepper spray, officials say.On her cross-country trip, she carried a compressed-air pistol, rubber tubing, a knife and a steel mallet. Captain Nowak had learned that Captain Shipman was romantically involved with Cmdr. William A. Oefelein, a shuttle pilot with whom Captain Nowak also had a relationship.A Navy spokeswoman, Cmdr. Lydia Robertson, said Wednesday that Captain Nowak had orders to report on March 21 to work as a staff member for the chief of naval air training in Corpus Christi, Tex.Captain Nowak is currently on leave from the Navy and living in Houston. She has been released from jail pending trial, though she must wear an electronic monitoring device.NASA's dismissal of her came as no surprise to her or her lawyer, Donald Lykkebak, said a spokeswoman for Mr. Lykkebak.The Navy has decided to reserve judgment against Captain Nowak pending the outcome of her case.</text></article><article id="1831457"><summary>Correction of Feb 9 article describing subway rerouting made necessary by cracked rail of N, R and W lines in Manhattan</summary><text>An article on Feb. 9 about subway delays caused by a cracked rail on the N, R and W lines in Manhattan carried incorrect information from transit officials about the location at which they began diverting Queens-bound R trains around the problem.

Kennedy by Kenneth P. O'Donnell and David F. Powers, who wrote that President Kennedy saw some political risk in hiring Mr. Schlesinger, an ardent liberal, as an adviser. It was published in 1972, not 1970.The obituary last Thursday also misstated the name of a federal agency that Mr. Schlesinger worked for during World War II. It was the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency; it was not the Office of Strategic Planning. It also misspelled the middle name of a former governor of New York who, with Mr. Schlesinger, was part of a powerful circle surrounding the journalist Joseph Alsop. He was W.

Bathed in the pale lunar glow, the heaving black Pacific washed onto a light, sandy beach. To the north, a curve of coastline was backed by imposing mountains, massive dark hulks in the dim light. Rolling ranchland, dotted with oaks just visible against the night sky, spread out to the east and south.This was the California coast, where a night in a hotel in the fabled beach towns between San Francisco and San Diego might run hundreds of dollars, and a week in even a modest beach house would cost $1,500 to $4,000. But I had found oceanside accommodations for $18.At Jalama Beach County Park, operated by Santa Barbara County, $18 bought a night in the park campground, the only publicly accessible spot on this wild stretch of coast for 40 miles. In summer, staying there -- or at any of the other public beach campgrounds in California -- would be almost impossible. Hordes of vacationers snap up the campsites the moment reservations for the weeks from Memorial Day and Labor Day become available. Those who do get spots find themselves packed in with other campers. But we -- my wife, Quinn, and I and our 18-month-old daughter, Lucy -- traveled at the end of January. For the most part, we found it was possible simply to drive up to the gate a few hours before sunset and rent a choice site.Sure, this was winter camping, but we toured the southernmost campgrounds and experienced sunny days with highs in the 60s, 70s, even 80s, great for wetsuit surfing, beachcombing and side trips into beach towns like Malibu and Laguna Beach. At night, when temperatures dropped into the 40s, we could bundle up to walk on the moonlit sand or stay snug in one of the most economical forms of camping accommodation available -- a reconditioned 1973 Volkswagen camper van.We had rented our van from Bill Staggs, an Orange County surfer whose company, Vintage Surfari Wagons, owns a small fleet of these retro relics, fully outfitted, roadworthy and refurbished. The price was $89 a day, and driving this funky motor home seemed an ideal way to meander along the Pacific Coast Highway.We started between San Diego and Los Angeles and worked north, finding a succession of well-equipped campgrounds, all with hot showers, inviting fire pits and separate sections for huge R.V.'s and small campers or tents. Everywhere, the beaches were beautiful and serene.San OnofreNestled between the sprawling Camp Pendleton Marine base and the charming surf-centered town of San Clemente, the San Onofre State Beach park runs roughly four miles from Cotton's Point, the site of the Western White House of President Richard M. Nixon, southward through a series of famed surfing breaks known as the Trestles before reaching the mile-long, palm-lined, thatched-hut paradise at the San Onofre Surfing Beach. Its wild strand is interrupted only by the ominous domes of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station before continuing south through a long stretch of untamed but easily accessible beaches known as the Trails.We reached the surfing beach in midafternoon on a Sunday. The crowd was sparse and the sky sunny. I threw on my wetsuit and paddled out in 60-degree water. I dropped into my first wave, and a dolphin rocketed through the water alongside me. A couple of hours later, Quinn and I were toasting the setting sun with chardonnay.The San Mateo campground, one of two at this park, is tucked into an unspoiled, oak-lined river valley. Though little more than a mile from the beach, and separated from it by Interstate 5, it seems a world away. On a peaceful Sunday night, the distant hum of traffic was drowned out by guitar strumming from a neighboring campsite and regular howls from a distant pack of coyotes.I crept out of the van before sunrise the next morning, eager to surf in front of the former Nixon estate. I shared the mile-and-a-half-long chaparral-lined trail to the beach (it crosses under the freeway along the banks of San Mateo Creek) with scores of rabbits, an owl and a coyote. After an hour of flawless waves, I hiked back, spotting a bobcat and a covey of startled quail.San Onofre is California's fifth-most-popular state park, but a proposed six-lane toll road would cross near the campground. If it is approved, opponents say, the landscape will be irrevocably altered. We were glad to have seen it before that happens.Leo CarrilloAbout 100 miles up the Pacific Coast Highway from San Onofre, Leo Carrillo State Park sits at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains along the oak and sycamore-shaded Arroyo Sequit, which is usually a dry creek bed but can become a torrent after winter storms. The arroyo meets the Pacific at a mile-long, mountain-shadowed crescent of beach with an often crowded surfing break and vast, anemone-filled tide pools, whose denizens positively fascinated Lucy.We were completely alone on the beach and nearly so in the campground, which is hidden among trees at the base of a long, verdant canyon.We parked and set up near the streambed. After a dinner cooked over the camper's propane stove, we settled in for sleep -- the camper has a double bed that folds out of the back seat and a bunk in the pop top. Owls and coyotes serenaded us to sleep.The next morning, we roamed the densely forested banks of the arroyo. The trees were filled with bluebirds and a shrieking flock of wild green parrots, which were regarded with some disdain by a large red-tailed hawk.(The park, by the way, was named for a California conservationist and actor, who is perhaps best known for his role as Pancho in the 1950s TV series ''The Cisco Kid.'')CarpinteriaThe shore at Carpinteria State Beach has been called the place where asphalt meets the sea -- not because of some modern roadway, but in honor of an eons-old tar pit that nature has placed right in front of one of the town's better surf spots. Chumash Indians once used the tar to seal their canoes. Close to the water, Lucy dug in soft sand, picked daisies, chased scores of gulls and gawked at a great blue heron stalking the dunes.In Carpinteria itself, a quirky but sophisticated little beach town about 13 miles south of Santa Barbara, we strolled along Linden Avenue, admiring the quaint shops, Craftsman homes and century-old palm trees all set against the 4,000-foot Santa Ynez Mountains. At the Rincon Designs surf shop, Lucy tried on about 10 pairs of toddler-size flip-flops.At the campground, we found another couple, Libba and Laurie Padgett, staying in a VW camper -- a 1989 Westfalia with an odometer reading of 385,000 kilometers (239,228 miles). The Padgetts had used it for a decade to make trips from their home in Powell River, British Columbia, to the desert Southwest. In 1975, in an earlier VW microbus, they drove with their four children across Mexico. ''They were all blond, and we got a lot of attention,'' Mr. Padgett said. ''There was love everywhere we went.''Of the campgrounds they'd visited, Mr. Padgett judged Carpinteria to be perhaps his favorite. ''It's beautiful here, and everything is so convenient to town,'' he said. ''And this town hasn't changed much through the years, but the rest of California is so different.''Jalama BeachThe lonely, winding 14-mile road off the Pacific Coast Highway leading to Jalama Beach County Park was spooky but majestic for after-dark arrival. To the north of this park is the mountainous Vandenburg Air Force Base; to the south are the gates of the 25,000-acre Bixby Ranch -- a place of sweeping foothills, happy cows and long surf breaks -- which was recently sold to an investment group for a reported $140 million.The roar of the ocean boomed through the van's open top early the next morning. In the soft sand outside were the pawprints of at least three raccoons that had been sniffing around for a leftover. Daylight offered a clearer picture of the rocky, windswept shore. This tiny 22-acre park has to be one of the prettiest campgrounds in all the West.Out on the chilly beach, a bundled-up group of campers oohed and aahed at the huge westerly swell. Nearby, some high-school-age surfers from Los Angeles huddled around a huge pan of sizzling bacon and prepared to do some surfing. Charlie Piechowski, 17, said he had followed the news of the ranch sale and hoped that it would mean more public access to well-known, difficult-to-reach breaks like Cojo and Government Points.Nancy Aardweg, the manager of the park's tiny general store, which also has a fine restaurant, said that some local people were concerned that the sale of the ranch might usher in a big development, changing the nature of this wild place.The restaurant's walls double as a museum, with shelves holding the history of Jalama in fossils, photographs and words. There, the September 1923 Honda Point Disaster, the Navy's worst navigational accident, is immortalized in pages from The Lompoc Record: ''The ships were going at such terrific speed when they hit that they bounded on top of the low reefs and tore great holes in their bottoms.'' (Twenty-three sailors died and seven nearly new destroyers were lost in the dense fog near the Santa Barbara Channel.)The air was chilly, and I took a walk alone along the beach toward the Tarantulas, an ominously named reef-bottomed surf break two miles south. Along the way, shells, driftwood, river stones and washed-up kelp lay below questionably stable sandstone cliffs. Throngs of tittering little shorebirds dug for food in the sand.Offshore, dolphins rode and dived, and I imagined a shipwrecked sailor struggling ashore. I like to surf, but I wanted no part of these enormous, frigid waves. The grandeur of the scenery was enough.ENDLESS WINTERFor Shorebirds and SnowbirdsRESERVATIONS for California state campgrounds, including those at San Onofre, Leo Carrillo and Carpinteria, can be made through Reserve America (www.reserveamerica.com) or by calling (800) 444-7275 or (916) 638-5883.

But instead of pounding pavement, millions now sprint into the woods, where the growing sport of trail running is bringing exercisers back to nature. About 6.7 million Americans now run on dirt or grass trails once a week or more, according to a 2006 report from the Outdoor Industry Foundation in Boulder, Colo.And where the recreational masses go, competition is quick to follow. This spring, dozens of trail-running races around the country are expected to draw crowds of enthusiastic contestants and spectators.''Many longtime road runners have gravitated to the new and different challenge of trail,'' said Michael Benge, editor of Trail Runner magazine, which has about 24,000 subscribers. ''You can get away from exhaust and noise and just run and enjoy the scenery.''Trail races range from 5-kilometer sprints through city parks to 100-mile epics in the mountains. All the facets of a regular competitive foot race -- from aid stations to sequestered spectator areas -- may accompany trail races. However, numbers are usually limited to a couple of hundred competitors or less. A marathon-size mass could irreparably alter a wilderness setting.At the Germantown 7- and 14-Mile Trail Runs, which take place March 31 in a park 50 miles north of Cincinnati, about 150 runners are expected to show up for some friendly local competition. The race, one in a series of 12 trail events organized this year by the Ohio River Road Runners Club, features a course of twisting trails through an old-growth woodland preserve where wild turkeys roost and orchids bloom with the warming days of spring.Dodge the Deer 5k and Mile Fun Run, held in Schodack Island State Park near Albany on April 15, attracts a crowd of serious sprinters as well as families with children as young as 5. Last year's winner, Jamie Rodriguez, a 25-year-old from Albany, blazed the 5-kilometer course in 16 minutes 53 seconds. An 8-year-old won the Mile Fun Run, beating out a costumed adult -- ''Bully the Bear'' -- by just two seconds.In Vancouver, British Columbia, where mossy and green mountains rise from the sea, the 25-kilometer Iron Knee race on May 27 attracts runners like Scott McMillan, a 32-year-old Web site developer who started running road marathons five years ago and then switched to trail. ''The wilderness is just so beautiful up here,'' he said. ''And I get stronger running in the woods.''Lifelong runners like Kurt Decker of Minneapolis, a 35-year-old manager at a running gear store, choose competitive ultra-distance trail races like the Ice Age Trail 50, held May 12 near La Grange, Wis. ''It's a visually stimulating course,'' Mr. Decker said of the 50-mile-long race trail, which rolls through deep woods and past the strange glacier-affected geology of the area, including kettles, kames, erratics and drumlins.A 50-kilometer version of the Ice Age Trail 50 is run simultaneously with the 50-mile version. Solo runners and relay teams make up a field of a couple of hundred competitors each year.The grandfather of all trail-running races is the Western States Endurance Run, a 100-mile course that begins at Squaw Valley, Calif., and follows trails used by gold and silver miners in the 1850s. This year's race begins at 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 23, and runners must reach the finish 100 miles down the line no later than 11 a.m. the following day.''I felt just floored at the starting line, thinking of the task ahead,'' said Greg Soderlund, 59, from Sacramento, Calif., who has competed in the Western States Endurance Run three times, finishing the course once, in 1992. Mr. Soderlund now serves as the race director.More than 1,000 people apply to race the Western States Endurance each year. A lottery system is used to whittle the field to 375, the final number of competitors allowed on the course. Sterling silver and bronze belt buckles serve as trophies for the finishers.''The experience was not physically pleasurable,'' Mr. Soderlund said of the precipitous mountain course, which gains and loses more than 40,000 feet of elevation. ''But it was very satisfying to finish.''DETAILSOHIO -- Germantown MetroPark.  What: Germantown Trail Runs, 7 and 14 miles; (937) 696-2378; www.orrrc.org.

The stunning beauty of the place can be elusive unless you're willing to move as gently and languidly as the River of Grass itself.Not quite the brackish swamp that many imagine it to be, the Everglades (first named Pa-hay-okee, for ''grassy water,'' by the Calusa Indians) is actually a wide, shallow river flowing through Florida's 80 southernmost miles of mainland and in many places blending into the shores of the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico. It flows like molasses, at the rate of just a quarter-mile a day.Living within those million-plus acres of wetlands are 200 types of fish, 350 species of birds, 120 different kinds of trees and more than 1,000 kinds of plants, just for starters, all only an hour south of Miami.''When people go to national parks, they expect to be blown away by the scenery, to be entertained by a canyon or a mountain,'' said Brian Ettling, an Everglades National Park ranger. ''We don't have that here. But we have biodiversity. And that makes this a beautiful place all on its own.''Of course, to see the iridescent-winged purple gallinule, breaching bottlenose dolphins and unmoving alligators soaking in the sun, you have to be willing to stop and venture into the saw-grass prairies and mangrove-lined waterways. But never fear: getting below the surface of this tangled landscape doesn't mean you have to be an expert hiker or kayaker. All you need are a few days to dip into the various sections of the national park -- accessible through three spread-out entrances -- and the adjoining Big Cypress National Preserve. You'll find plenty of organized ranger programs and self-guided tour maps to get you on your way.Approach via the Tamiami Trail -- a straight and scenic byway that connects the east and west coasts of southern Florida -- and you'll easily find all the points worth stopping for.The park's Gulf Coast Visitor Center, in the small fishing village of Everglades City, sits at the precipice of glistening Chokoloskee Bay and the Ten Thousand Islands area. This pristine region of mangroves and saltwater marshes and sandy keys is mostly reachable only by boat on the 99-mile Wilderness Waterway canoe and kayak trail.Experienced paddlers can plunge right into a days-long journey, camping on raised ''chickee'' platforms or sand spits. Beginners are best off joining the short, organized trips on more navigable creeks, led by park naturalists like Mr. Ettling, 38.''I never get tired of this area,'' he said one day this winter as he led canoeists paddling single file beneath a cathedral of arching mangrove branches. He excitedly pointed out blue herons, jumping mullet fish and skittish tree crabs.''One acre of mangroves drops three and a half tons of leaves each year,'' he said, gesturing to a flurry of green in golden sunlight. ''It's snowing mangrove leaves! When the leaves hit the water, that's when the food chain here begins.''He gave lessons on the hunting habits of swooping turkey vultures, which have a sense of smell that's five times stronger than that of bloodhounds, and on the hip attributes of screechy red-shouldered hawks: ''They're like the local punk rockers. They eat lizards and scream.''To the disappointment of some, Mr. Ettling explained that there were no alligators or crocodiles in this area. That doesn't go for the whole park -- the Everglades is the only place in the world where alligators, which live in fresh water, and saltwater crocodiles live side by side.The Everglades sustained decades of draining, damming, diverting and polluting before being recognized as a vital ecosystem. In 1947 the national park was established in the southern portion, and today a million and a half people visit every year. The Big Cypress National Preserve is just to the north on a tract that narrowly escaped being developed as Miami's international airport in the 70s. It's in Big Cypress that visitors can take thrill rides on high-speed airboats -- skiffs propelled by earsplitting, powerful fans. Airboats are banned in the park because they are so damaging to native flora.A Big Cypress driving tour, north of the Gulf Coast canoe launch on the gravel Turner River Road, offers various close-up encounters with alligators; one day in January, a lineup of five floated lazily along a narrow creek, with nothing but steely eyes and snouts above water.''When it's windy, they like to hang out in there,'' explained Ann Wilson, a volunteer who stood at the side of the road near her white Chevy pickup, binoculars in hand, excitedly waving down any passers-by so she could share her discovery of a mother osprey guarding chicks in a sky-high nest. Technically Mrs. Wilson, 68, was on alligator patrol -- ''people patrol, actually,'' she whispered. Sometimes visitors get a bit too friendly, and alligators quickly learn to expect handouts of bread.Farther east from Turner River Road is a novel opportunity for folks who prefer to explore on foot: ranger-led swamp hikes that set off from the Oasis Visitor Center in Big Cypress. ''From the highway, all you see is brown and green,'' noted Corinne Fenner, 27, a ranger who was coaxing a group of five people into the thigh-deep waters of a cypress-tree stand. ''It's nice to get out into the prairie and notice all the colors.''The hues were certainly magical: the butter yellow of the Everglades' daisy, bright violet of nettle-leaf velvetberry flowers, electric lime of freshwater sponges and deep scarlet of a red-bellied woodpecker. And the water itself -- which collects in a sandy peat and limestone basin, helping silvery bald cypress trees thrive -- looked shockingly clear. It also felt deliciously cool soaking through jeans and sneakers. Creatures from tiny apple snails to grand, prehistoric wood storks kept the group company, but there were no mosquitoes; the buggy ''wet season'' is from June till October.''It's like this idyllic little enchanted world,'' said Beth Graybill, 48, the manager of a nonprofit Mennonite-history center in Lancaster, Pa., who had joined the hike along with her husband and their delighted 8-year-old son.''This is unique on the planet,'' added her husband, Paul Brubaker, 53, a high-school photography teacher. ''And most people miss it unless they do stuff like this, where you have to slow down and really get in there.''That doesn't always mean getting your feet wet. An intricate system of wilderness trails in the national park runs from the central and southeast entrances. To find them, continue east on the Tamiami -- but not before stopping into the Big Cypress Gallery, where the large-format, black and white landscape photography of Clyde Butcher perfectly captures the romantic essence of this swampland. Past there, you'll come to the park's Shark Valley entrance, where a paved loop is traversable by foot, bicycle or guided tram ride, and is often host to sleepy crocs or gators.''THE thing that made that trail worthwhile was seeing baby alligators,'' said Lucy Chou, 41, a knitwear contractor from New York City who biked with her husband through strong winds to glimpse the Shark Valley wildlife.To hang with more creatures than you can count, head farther southeast, through the sweeping farmlands and exotic fruit orchards of Homestead and Florida City and back into the park through the main Ernest F. Coe entrance.Raised boardwalk trails wind through this region -- particularly the Anhinga Trail, named for the majestic water bird that stands with wings stretched wide to dry its black and white feathers in the sun. A recent stroll found several, plus green and tri-colored herons, red-bellied turtles, a shy purple gallinule, endless double-crested cormorants and nearly a dozen alligators. Hardcore birders stood frozen behind cameras on tripods, waiting for their favorites to appear. Clutches of tourists pointed in wonder, chatting in Spanish or German. And an unwieldy young school group quieted down quickly after spotting its first fat gator in the grass below the boardwalk.Deeper into this segment of the park lies the striking Pa-hay-okee Overlook, a short and steep boardwalk that juts out over a dreamily endless field of billowing, wheat-colored saw grass. It's an exquisite example of what the conservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas described lovingly in her 1947 classic ''The Everglades: River of Grass.''''The spears prick upward, tender green, glass green, bright green, darker green, to spread the blossoms and the fine seeds like brown lace,'' she wrote. ''The grass stays. The fresh river flows.''IF YOU GOFinding a Path Through the Great SwampEVERGLADES National Park (www.nps.gov/ever/) has three entrances: the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center (305-242-7700) near Homestead; the Shark Valley Visitor Center (305-221-8776) on the Tamiami Trail; and the Gulf Coast Visitor Center (239-695-3311) in Everglades City. In Big Cypress (www.nps.gov/bicy), the Oasis Visitor Center (239-695-1201) is on the Tamiami Trail. All ranger-led activities are free.Clyde Butcher's Big Cypress Gallery (239-695-2428) is just east of the Oasis Visitor Center on the Tamiami Trail.The closest accommodations to the west side of the park are in Everglades City. The Everglades Spa and Lodge (201 West Broadway, 239-695-3151; www.evergladeslodge.com), in a former bank, has cozy rooms for $110 to $135 a night. At the taxidermy-filled Rod and Gun Club (239-695-2101), rooms are $125 a night. At the Ivey House (239-695-3299; www.iveyhouse.com), in-season rooms cost $140. The Ivey House also runs kayak tours through its North American Canoe Tours outfitting company (www.evergladesadventures.com).For dining, the Rod and Gun Club is the most upscale option in Everglades City. The funky Big House Coffee (238 Mamie Street, Chokoloskee Island; 239-695-3633) is a cool spot for great java, sandwiches and baked goods.Another option while on the Gulf Coast is to stay in Naples, just 40 minutes away from the park.Near the park's eastern entrance, chain motels are clustered in Homestead and Florida City. You can also stay in Miami and make day trips. The many dining options include Casita Tejas (27 North Krome Avenue, Homestead; 305-248-8224) for Mexican food and Robert Is Here (19200 Southwest 344th Street, Homestead; 305-246-1592), a bustling market known for its thick, fresh-fruit milkshakes (try the key lime) and exotic produce.American Journeys | Everglades National Park</text></article><article id="1831556"><summary>Ginia Bellafante reviews Stephen Bergman and Janet Surrey play Bill W and Dr Bob; Robert Krakovski and Patrick Husted star; photo (M)</summary><text>In the spring of 1935 Bill Wilson, a self-proclaimed rum hound from New York, found himself on a business trip in Akron, Ohio, trying to annihilate his craving for a drink. He had bottomed out in a hospital some months earlier. While he was there, he was awakened by a flash of light and experienced a spiritual conversion. It impelled him to forsake the compulsion that had taken the inevitable toll on his marriage and effectively ended his career on Wall Street.But in the lobby of that Akron hotel, he wanted what he wanted. Though he might have pursued any number of distractions -- a game of solitaire, rereading William James -- he chose to make a phone call instead. What followed forms the basis of ''Bill W. and Dr. Bob,'' a new play about the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous that in its own subtle, and perhaps even unintentional, way, releases Wilson from the trap of hagiography that the culture has kept him in.Aldous Huxley once called Wilson ''the greatest social architect'' of the 20th century. But the playwrights, Stephen Bergman, a doctor and novelist, and his wife, Janet Surrey, a clinical psychologist, are less committed to the idea of Wilson as a revolutionary thinker than to the notion that the recovery movement's central catechism essentially came about as a series of accidents.This view allows them to achieve drama from the familiar story of A.A.'s origins. In Akron it occurred to Wilson (Robert Krakovski), as it might occur to someone to pick up a quart of milk, that he might feel better if he talked to another drunk, so he called a minister who led him eventually to a surgeon named Bob Smith (Patrick Husted).If Smith could match Wilson's capacity for self-destruction, he was no equal in grandiosity. Smith was a recessive man who had some involvement with the Oxford Group, a Christian organization popular in the 1930s that preached self-improvement through divine guidance and accountability. He was deeply uncomfortable with the idea of religious surrender, and Mr. Husted delivers the play's sense of his exasperation with a cynic's bitter humor.About Henrietta Seiberling, leader of the Oxford Group in Akron, Bob, speaking like an addled 15-year-old, proclaims: ''It's like having the D.T.'s. Every time I turn around, Henrietta Seiberling. When she says 'the Divinity,' I wanna puke.''Still, Wilson and Smith borrowed the Oxford Group's principles, as they borrowed from transcendentalism, because these philosophies seemed applicable to fighting addiction. Together the two men looked for alcoholics to convert.At the bedside of one young man, hospitalized for his problem, their evangelism seems to be working until the patient says he could never entirely give up drinking. Wilson blurts out that he might think about giving it up just for that day, and thus one of A.A.'s most celebrated tenets is born.It was once said about Wilson that he could talk a dog off a meat wagon, but Mr. Krakovski never transcends the salesman to access the solemnity for which Wilson was also known. In ''The Big Book,'' the A.A. bible, Wilson wrote: ''I was never an atheist. Few people actually are, for that means blind faith in the proposition that this universe originated in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere.''The Wilson that Mr. Krakovski portrays seems incapable of any elegant contemplation. He wears a slick look on his face and moves about as if a fly were buzzing around in his jacket. He is all showman all the time -- a very unlikely savior. But that, perhaps, is the point.''Bill W. and Dr. Bob'' is in an open-ended run at New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831560"><summary>Manohla Dargis reviews film The Host, directed by Bong Joon-ho; Bae Doo-na, Song Kang-ho and Byun Hee-bong star; photos (M)</summary><text>The plug-ugly monster that jumps out of a city river in ''The Host'' to scoop up and chomp down on those unlucky enough to cross its path -- men, women, a whip-smart 13-year-old girl named Hyun-seo -- looks like something you might find lurking at the bottom of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or trolling the depths of a murky restaurant aquarium in the middle of a toxic dump. Blink and it looks like something that slimed out of the sea in a creationist nightmare.It would have to be an awfully big aquarium, as it happens, because this fishy creature, this mystery from the deep with the gulping petaled mouth and prehensile tail is the size of a school bus and restless to boot. It rushes underwater and races over ground, its sturdy little legs churning turf. Every so often it spirals into a back flip as gracefully as a prepubescent Romanian gymnast or drops into the water like a knife, scoring a perfect-10 dive. It's as ugly as sin, this thing, but it has style to burn. As does this film, a loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid from the South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, about the demons that haunt us from without and within.By turns a carnival of horrors and a family melodrama (variations on the same theme), ''The Host'' is also a rethink of those 1950s cine-quickies in which mondo ants, locusts, wasps, crabs and snails and one seriously ticked off amphibious reptile go on the rampage, visiting punishment on a hapless, guilty humanity. Like Godzilla (Gojira in the original Japanese), some of these mutants were born under a mushroom cloud; others were hatched in the B-movie hothouse of box-office opportunism. The creature running amok in ''The Host,'' meanwhile, was spawned by a 37-year-old South Korean who has spent his entire life in the shadow of the American military presence. No wonder the bad guys look like character actors on leave from Hollywood. They are.As if in preparation for the carnage to come, the once-upon-a-time story opens in a modern autopsy room with two men, an American and a Korean, dressed in scrubs. Bathed in an eerie, silvery blue light, the American boss (Scott Wilson) orders the Korean (Kim Hak-sun) to dump bottle upon bottle of formaldehyde down the drain, on the pretext that the containers have become too dusty.Stunned, the Korean objects, noting that the chemical will flow from the drain into the Han River, the fat ribbon of water that cuts through Seoul and empties into the Yellow Sea. The American grimaces, capping his request with a barely veiled threat (''That's an order'') that betrays him as an emissary of American military might.Fast-forward to a day like any other and the Park family running its snack stand on the banks of the Han. Calculatingly, goofily dysfunctional, with enough issues to populate a couple of 12-step groups, the Parks don't seem all that different from the brood in ''Little Miss Sunshine.'' There's gramps, Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong), his three adult children -- including an unemployed salaryman, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), and his archery-champ sister, the lovely Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) -- and only grandchild, the aforementioned Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung). Mostly, though, there is the family's oldest son, Gang-du (the wonderful Song Kang-ho), an overgrown baby with a shock of badly bleached blond hair and a moon face that waxes and wanes depending on his proximity to his beloved daughter, Hyun-seo.Bong Joon-ho's previous features include a smart-aleck exercise in gratuitous nonsense called ''Barking Dogs Never Bite'' (they just comically kick the bucket) and the shiver-inducing thriller ''Memories of Murder.'' As he did in ''Memories,'' about the hunt for a serial killer, Mr. Bong relies on a familiar bag of movie tricks in ''The Host.'' But, much like Steven Spielberg (an unmistakable influence), he makes all those old tricks feel new. That's especially true during the monster's first attack, when Mr. Bong instills an initial sense of calm and then of rapidly escalating panic through his masterful orchestration of the various tempos created by the actors (walking, then running), the monster (swimming, then galloping), the camera (tracking, then racing) and the edits (slow, slow, fast!).The opening attack is sensationally well directed, and if the rest of the film never quickens the pulse in the same accelerated fashion, it does give the story both its principal excuse (the monster grabs the granddaughter) and something just as satisfying if unexpected: a portrait of parents, children and the ties that bind, sometimes to the point of near-strangulation. ''The Host'' may be born out of sociopolitical tensions, scares about SARS and the avian flu, or Mr. Bong's imagination, but it's also a snapshot of a modern South Korea bordering on social anarchy, one in which a fatalistically obedient old-timer and his three preternaturally immature adult children face down a rampaging beast along with clueless doctors, Keystone Kops, faithless friends and even hordes of paparazzi.Besieged by humans and monster alike, the family has nowhere to go but deep inside itself. This us-against-them strategy works deviously well because it ensures that the Parks are the star attraction, not the monster. Not that the creature doesn't have its share of show-stopping moments, as when it's caught by surprise in midgulp, a pair of legs dangling from its mouth. Or when it regurgitates a corpse into its lair with a slimy splat, an act it seals with a tender lick of its long tongue. It's in this lair that Hyun-seo, her face and schoolgirl's uniform flecked with muck, proves her mettle, retrieving the cellphone that becomes the lifeline to her family and playing protector to another child who adds a touching dimension to the mix.Although some of Mr. Bong's action scenes here are the match of those in ''Jaws,'' he seems made of sterner stuff than Mr. Spielberg. He can seem just as cruel, readily putting children in mortal danger, but he doesn't share the American master's compulsive need for tidy endings.''The Host'' is a loose, almost borderline messy film, one that sometimes feels like a mash-up of contrasting, at times warring movies, methods and moods. Mr. Bong would as soon have us shriek with laughter as with fright. But it's precisely that looseness, that willingness to depart from the narrative straight and narrow, that makes the film feel closer to a new chapter than a retread.Likewise it is Mr. Bong's willingness not just to contemplate but also to deliver a worst-case scenario that separates ''The Host'' from run-of-the-mill horror and may have helped make it a runaway hit in Korea. Closer to home the film reminds me less of the usual splatter entertainments that clutter American movie theaters and more of another recent horror film, the one in which a newly thawed alien with a giant brain delivers apocalyptic warnings to humanity about its imminent future. I'm talking of course about the documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth.''Much like that Al Gore big-screen lecture, ''The Host'' is a cautionary environmental tale about the domination of nature and the costs of human folly, and it may send chills up your spine. But only one will tickle your fancy and make you cry encore, not just uncle.''The Host'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains monster violence galore.The Host  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Bong Joon-ho; written (in Korean, with English subtitles) by Mr. Bong, Hah Joon-won and Baek Chul-hyun, based on a story by Mr. Bong; director of photography, Kim Hyung-goo; edited by Kim Sun-min; music by Byeongwoo Lee; production designer, Ryu Seong-hee; produced by Choi Yong-bae; released by Magnolia Pictures.

Tall white pines frame the winding streets, and a car unexpectedly parked by the side of the road prompts a friendly offer of assistance.The West River weaves through town, recalling bygone days when it was crucial to the lumber industry. Today, forested hillsides are cut with powdered ski runs that signal the region's new economy.''We love the location,'' said Peter Sternbach, 70, a retired international business consultant from Westport, Conn. ''It's very rural, with lots to do.''He and his wife, Anna Marie, 69, bought a three-bedroom chalet in 1973 for $36,000. They have since made significant improvements to the house, including the addition of a screened porch, an upstairs bathroom and a modern kitchen.The couple cross-country ski and snowshoe on trails along the river or in Landgrove, a hamlet near Londonderry. In summer, they hike, swim in Hapgood Pond and often attend performances at the Weston Playhouse six miles north on Route 100 -- ''The King and I'' and ''Hairspray'' are promised for the summer -- or at the Southern Vermont Arts Center about 15 miles southwest in Manchester.Compared with properties on Stratton Mountain, where the average price of a single-family home is just over $1 million and three-bedroom town houses are $800,000 to $1.2 million, properties in Londonderry are a steal. The average selling price of a house last year was $379,000.''Initially, we thought we couldn't afford the area,'' said Pamela Erickson, 51, a real estate broker from Bordentown, N.J., who spent summers in Vermont as a child at her parents' log cabin near Bennington, about 40 miles southwest.In looking to buy their own property in Vermont, she and her husband, John McDonald, 50, a telecommunications engineer, were ''open to a wide range of styles and prices,'' she said. They looked at seven places before they bought their four-bedroom, cedar-sided house for $254,500 two months ago.''I loved that it was on a cul-de-sac'' off Route 100, Ms. Erickson said, where ''we're close to the ski hills, yet it feels private.''The SceneBy late Friday afternoon, the parking lot of the Mountain Marketplace, a strip of stores at the junction of Routes 11 and 100, teems with station wagons and pickups bearing ski racks or snowmobile trailers, as weekenders get food and other provisions at Clark's Quality Foods, the town's supermarket. From May through October, the parking lot of Mill Tavern on Route 11 is host to a farmers' market.Still dressed in their Nordic ski sweaters, families with young children dine at the dimly lighted, antique-filled Mill Tavern, whose owner, Ed Brown, greets guests by name.Other weekenders head across town to the Three Clock Inn, a restaurant with white table linens and votive candles that has attracted the attention of food magazines over the years with dishes like its Maine lobster pot pie and roast rack of Colorado lamb.One recent Saturday morning at the Village Pantry, a gourmet coffee-food-wine shop in South Londonderry, two contractors in paint-speckled sweatshirts stood in line for egg sandwiches beside a female snowboarder in white, rhinestone-studded snow pants and another woman clutching a Chlo&#233; handbag. But by 8 a.m., many weekenders are already on the mountain.''Best runs are the first runs,'' said Chris Lautenslager, 49, who works for a commodities exchange in Manhattan. Last fall, he and Bernadette Grey, 43, an editor of children's books, bought a six-bedroom, three-bathroom chalet-style house on six acres for $330,000.Between them, they have five children who range in age from 8 to 14, all of whom are skiers or boarders. In summer, they also bike, canoe and swim in the quarry near Manchester.On Saturday night ''we hang,'' Mr. Lautenslager said, echoing the sentiment of many families who snuggle into their homes after a day on the slopes.ProsBeing near the ski hills is a huge draw for most seasonal homeowners, said Andy Reed, an agent with Stratton Buyer Brokerage in Londonderry. With three resorts within a few miles of town -- Stratton, Bromley and Magic Mountains -- and Okemo about 20 miles north, Londonderry is the center of the mountains, he said.''You don't have to drive 20 minutes to a grocery store,'' said Mr. Lautenslager, who enjoys the basics the town offers: a grocery store, a hardware store, a pharmacy, a health food store and a bank.''People are very friendly,'' said Mr. Sternbach, who has befriended a number of second- and third-generation Vermont families in the region.ConsCellphone reception is unreliable, and high-speed Internet access is not available in some areas -- but some people might see that as a plus. For those who live in Connecticut, Londonderry is a manageable three-to-four-hour drive, but for homeowners who live south or west of Manhattan, the weekend trip can be difficult.''We'd love it if it were closer to New Jersey,'' said Ms. Erickson, who generally makes it to Londonderry in five and a half hours.Taxes have jumped for some property owners, Mr. Sternbach said. In the 34 years that he and his wife have lived in Londonderry, he has seen bed-and-breakfasts and stores close, he said, because their owners ''couldn't afford the taxes.''The Real Estate MarketProperties with views of Stratton or Bromley are very sought after, Mr. Reed said, with many seasonal homeowners looking for land on which to build hiking or horse trails. Prospective buyers ask about an apartment, garage or other rental property, though most never rent it, he said. ''People are buying houses they feel they can comfortably manage,'' he added.Rather than build new homes, weekenders are renovating existing homes, with saltboxes and capes predominant. Most available properties in Londonderry list for $400,000 to $600,000, though a 1970s ski chalet can be found for less than $300,000. A 10-acre lot might be priced anywhere from $200,000 to $700,000. Homes are staying on the market for more than six months, Mr. Reed said. ''People aren't that anxious to buy.''Many of the younger baby boomers are acquiring property with an eye toward retirement. ''Our goal is to eventually transition here,'' said Mr. Lautenslager. He and his family try to spend three weekends each month in Londonderry.''Remember when we were kids and we'd go out in the yard to play?'' he said. ''And it wasn't scheduled, and it wasn't a play date? That's what it's like here.''LAY OF THE LANDPOPULATION -- 1,709, according to the town clerk.SIZE -- 32.6 square miles.WHO'S BUYING -- Skiers and outdoor enthusiasts in their 40s and 50s who have school-aged children.

Adapted from a graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, it offers up a bombastic spectacle of honor and betrayal, rendered in images that might have been airbrushed onto a customized van sometime in the late 1970s. The basic story is a good deal older. It's all about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, which unfolded at a narrow pass on the coast of Greece whose name translates as Hot Gates.Hot Gates, indeed! Devotees of the pectoral, deltoid and other fine muscle groups will find much to savor as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 prime Spartan porterhouses into battle against Persian forces commanded by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), a decadent self-proclaimed deity who wants, as all good movie villains do, to rule the world.The Persians, pioneers in the art of facial piercing, have vastly greater numbers -- including ninjas, dervishes, elephants, a charging rhino and an angry bald giant -- but the Spartans clearly have superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities. They also hew to a warrior ethic of valor and freedom that makes them, despite their gleeful appetite for killing, the good guys in this tale. (It may be worth pointing out that unlike their mostly black and brown foes, the Spartans and their fellow Greeks are white.)But not all the Spartans back in Sparta support their king on his mission. A gaggle of sickly, corrupt priests, bought off by the Persians, consult an oracular exotic dancer whose topless gyrations lead to a warning against going to war. And the local council is full of appeasers and traitors, chief among them a sardonic, shifty-eyed smoothy named Theron (Dominic West, known to fans of ''The Wire'' as the irrepressible McNulty).Too cowardly to challenge Leonidas man to man, he fixes his attention on Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), a loyal wife and Spartan patriot who fights the good fight on the home front. Gorgo understands her husband's noble purpose, the higher cause for which he is willing to sacrifice his life. ''Come home with your shield or on it,'' she tells him as he heads off into battle after a night of somber marital whoopee. Later she observes that ''freedom is not free.''Another movie -- Matt Stone and Trey Parker's ''Team America,'' whose wooden puppets were more compelling actors than most of the cast of ''300'' -- calculated the cost at $1.05. I would happily pay a nickel less, in quarters or arcade tokens, for a vigorous 10-minute session with the video game that ''300'' aspires to become. Its digitally tricked-up color scheme, while impressive at times, is hard to tolerate for nearly two hours (true masochists can seek out the Imax version), and the hectic battle scenes would be much more exciting in the first person. I want to chop up some Persians too!There are a few combat sequences that achieve a grim, brutal grandeur, notably an early engagement in which the Spartans, hunkered behind their shields, push back against a Persian line, forcing enemy soldiers off a cliff into the water. The big idea, spelled out over and over in voice-over and dialogue in case the action is too subtle, is that the free, manly men of Sparta fight harder and more valiantly than the enslaved masses under Xerxes' command. Allegory hunters will find some gristly morsels of topicality tossed in their direction, but you can find many of the same themes, conveyed with more nuance and irony, in a Pok&#233;mon cartoon.Zack Snyder's first film, a remake of George Romero's ''Dawn of the Dead,'' showed wit as well as technical dexterity. While some of that filmmaking acumen is evident here, the script for ''300,'' which he wrote with Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon, is weighed down by the lumbering portentousness of the original book, whose arresting images are themselves undermined by the kind of pomposity that frequently mistakes itself for genius.In time, ''300'' may find its cultural niche as an object of camp derision, like the sword-and-sandals epics of an earlier, pre-computer-generated-imagery age. At present, though, its muscle-bound, grunting self-seriousness is more tiresome than entertaining. Go tell the Spartans, whoever they are, to stay home and watch wrestling.''300'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Sajbel's ''Ultimate Gift'' is a hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox's new faith-based label, Fox Faith. If the goal is to attract Christian dollars to the multiplex, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of their owners is not the best way to go.The focus of our learning and growing is Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller), a trust-fund baby who shows up at the funeral of his billionaire grandfather, Red (James Garner), sporting morning-after shades, day-old stubble and a dangling cigarette: the badges, if not the wages, of sin. Before he can get his hands on granddaddy's money, however, Jason must complete a series of tasks assigned by Red via a videotaped will and designed to teach the value of friendship, love and all the other things we like to believe rich people are lacking. Should Jason's spirit quail, there's an adorable, leukemia-stricken child (Abigail Breslin) waiting in the wings with a bottomless supply of homilies. And you thought her performance in ''Little Miss Sunshine'' was saccharine.As Jason braves drug runners in Ecuador, and a stint on a Texas ranch laying fence and listening to Patsy Cline (''So this is hell,'' he moans), the movie's messages -- pro-poverty, anti-abortion -- are methodically hammered home. And while it's always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, ''The Ultimate Gift'' is a cinematic sermon that even reprises its bullet points during the end credits. In case anyone is wondering, I totally aced the test afterward.''The Ultimate Gift'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

The wrenching ''Hotel Rwanda'' (2004) was a contemporary African ''Schindler's List'' in which a man of conscience risked everything to protect more than a thousand Tutsi refugees from slaughter by bloodthirsty Hutu thugs. The heroism of the real-life Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), the hotel manager who turned the elegant H&#244;tel des Mille Collines in the capital city, Kigali, into a refuge, left you hanging on a thread of hope. You could console yourself with the notion that after all is said and done, goodness and decency still flicker like candles in a distant window.''Beyond the Gates,'' which revisits many of the same events, was filmed on location using many survivors of the genocide as cast and crew. Though less reassuring and not as dramatically coherent as ''Hotel Rwanda,'' it still packs a hard punch. Instead of a luxury hotel, the refuge sought by 2,500 desperate Tutsis is the &#201;cole Technique Officielle, a secondary school in Kigali that also served as a headquarters for United Nations peacekeeping forces. When those troops eventually leave the country, the 2,500 refugees are left behind to fend for themselves.The movie addresses two unrelated questions. The first -- why the West sat back as the catastrophe unfolded -- isn't satisfactorily answered, although a peripheral character, a BBC newswoman (Nicola Walker) who instructs a TV crew to videotape the butchery, suggests an answer. When she was in Bosnia, she recalls, she cried every day at the atrocities. Here, she observes, it's ''just dead Africans.''The movie goes further than its forerunner in dramatizing the stony attitude of the United Nations, embodied by Captain Delon (Dominique Horwitz), the implacably hard-nosed French leader of the peacekeeping forces who refuses to disobey orders and get involved, even after Hutus kill 10 Belgian soldiers. Their instructions are to shoot only when fired upon, he repeatedly emphasizes.The United Nations forces, however, are allowed to shoot dogs sniffing hacked-up corpses outside the school's gates, because the animals are thought to pose a health threat. When ''Beyond the Gates'' was released overseas, it had a different title: ''Shooting Dogs.''The second and deeper issue addressed by the film is the question of religious and spiritual faith in the face of genocide. What is true faith, and how much horror does it take to erode it? Can a reasonable person still believe in God amid the slaughter of 800,000 people? Does reason have anything to do with it?These questions are channeled through the consciences of two Britons, one religious, the other not. Father Christopher (John Hurt), a world-weary Catholic priest who has worked in Africa for 30 years and preaches in a church at the school, is the man of faith. The other, Joe Connor (Hugh Dancy), is a young teacher, political idealist and do-gooder spending a year at the school. Between the two, there is no contest when it comes to courage and strength of character. Faith trumps mere altruism.In the midst of carnage Father Christopher performs baptisms and preaches about God's love. ''God does not always like what we do, but he loves all of us,'' he replies when confronted with the horrors around him. This initially infuriating character gains moral stature as the depth of his faith and his willingness to risk his life are revealed. Mr. Hurt, exuding equal measures of fortitude and sorrowful fatalism, has never been better.Joe, outraged by the carnage and the refusal of anyone in authority to try to stop it, eventually meets the ultimate challenge: When all the whites in Kigali are evacuated by the French, he must decide whether to leave or remain to face probable death.Joe appears to be the fictional alter ego of David Belton, a producer of the film, who collaborated on the story. Mr. Belton was a BBC correspondent posted in Rwanda in 1994. In the production notes he is quoted voicing his guilt at leaving the country when he did: ''In a sense the whole Rwandan genocide was about failure, and I wanted to focus on that,'' he says. ''I felt I had failed as a journalist.'' The movie, directed by Michael Caton-Jones, might be taken as a belated act of contrition.Unlike the more squeamish ''Hotel Rwanda,'' ''Beyond the Gates'' confronts the physical reality of mass slaughter in shots of city streets littered with hacked-up bodies. The scenes of Hutu militias tooting whistles and dancing in an orgy of butchery are some of the most chilling depictions of vengeful mob madness ever filmed. Yet ''Beyond the Gates'' knows just how far to go without turning into a Mel Gibson bloodbath. Most of the actual killings take place out of the camera's sight.In the movie's saddest moment a Tutsi tribesman pleads with Captain Delon to shoot them so they won't be crudely butchered. He bluntly refuses.''Beyond the Gates'' falls short in many areas. It barely sketches the history of Hutu-Tutsi strife, ignores the role of Belgian colonists in stimulating simmering tribal hatred and leaves us to assume that the Hutus are fiends and the slaughtered Tutsis martyred saints. Good and evil are never as clear-cut as that.Beyond the Gates  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Michael Caton-Jones; written by David Wolstencroft, based on a story by Richard Alwyn and David Belton; director of photography, Ivan Strasburg; edited by Christian Lonk; music by Dario Marianelli; production designer, Bertram Strauss; produced by Mr. Belton, Pippa Cross and Jens Meurer; released by IFC Films.

Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now.''The Namesake,'' adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, conveys a palpable sense of people as living, breathing creatures who are far more complex than their words might indicate. The story of upwardly mobile immigrants torn between tradition and modernity as they are absorbed into the American melting pot has been told in countless movies.This variation is gentle and compassionate. The longing for roots of these displaced middle-class Indians lends a soulful undertow to a film conspicuously lacking in melodrama.Ms. Nair has a sympathetic collaborator in Sooni Taraporevala, the Indian screenwriter who also wrote her first two features, ''Salaam Bombay!'' (1988) and ''Mississippi Masala'' (1991). Its steady, unhurried pace, its fascination with the rituals of daily life and its deep respect for characters who are continually evolving lift ''The Namesake'' above high-end soap opera. It may lack epic grandeur, but by the end you feel you know these people well enough to keep in step with their internal rhythms.The film has a crackling star performance by Kal Penn (from the clever trash comedy ''Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle''), who brings an offhanded charisma to the role of Gogol, the first-born child of Ashima (Tabu), a classically trained singer, and Ashoke Ganguli (Irrfan Khan), an aspiring engineer, who move to America in 1977 after their arranged marriage in Calcutta.Alone together in a foreign land in the middle of winter, the shy, polite newlyweds are virtual strangers, and the movie captures their delicate process of mutual accommodation. Ashima's initiation into American culture has gentle, humorous moments. She is astonished to discover gas stoves that work 24 hours a day and learns the hard way that wool sweaters should not be dumped into a washing machine.A prologue looks back to a turning point in Ashoke's life. During a train trip in 1974 to visit his grandfather, a friendly stranger advises him to leave India and see the world. Ashoke is reading ''The Overcoat,'' the famous story by the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, who spent much of his life outside his homeland. When the train crashes later in the trip, Ashoke miraculously survives, and the Gogol story becomes a totem in his life, a symbolic tie to his homeland and an omen of good luck.Years later when his son is born, Ashoke is told that the baby cannot leave the hospital without a name. In India several years might pass before a child is given a formal name, chosen by the maternal grandmother. Ashoke impulsively calls his son Gogol. As the boy grows up, his ambivalence about his temporary name, which he embraces, then rejects (his formal name is Nikhil), becomes a metaphor for his divided cultural identity.In high school Gogol rebels from his family and behaves like a typical pot-smoking, rock-'n'-roll-loving American teenager. On a visit to Calcutta he sneers at Indian ways. After studying architecture at Yale, he falls in love with Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), a stereotypical blonde WASP princess from Long Island. Cultural tensions flare when he brings her home to meet his family, and the couple are expected to withhold any expressions of physical affection, according to Indian tradition.Gogol eventually falls in love with Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson), a beautiful Bengali woman who lived a freewheeling life in Paris before coming to the United States. His female counterpart, she is as culturally confused as he is, and the relationship runs into trouble.Despite all the tensions in the Ganguli household, ''The Namesake'' expresses a reassuring faith in family solidarity. Avoiding the clich&#233; of pitting disobedient immigrant children in pitched battles against tradition-bound parents from the old country, the film assumes that blood ties are the strongest bonds holding together the social order.In the second half of the movie the Ganguli parents step into the background as the focus shifts to Gogol. But instead of disappearing, Ashoke and Ashima loom as dignified, stabilizing pillars of tolerance and devotion whom their son and his younger sister, Sonia (Sahira Nair), cherish, even as they reject the old ways.''The Namesake'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations.The Namesake  Opens today in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto.Directed by Mira Nair; written by Sooni Taraporevala, based on the novel by Jhumpa Lahiri; director of photography, Frederick Elmes; edited by Allyson C.

That observation from Billie Holiday's ''God Bless the Child'' sums up the cynical view of ''Maxed Out,'' James D. Scurlock's documentary investigation of debt in America. This scattershot expos&#233; of usurious banking practices examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: It's obscenely profitable.Although ''Maxed Out'' would like to be this year's ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' it doesn't measure up. ''Enron'' was a stronger film because its focus was specific, the personalities under its microscope were outsize, and its story had a beginning, middle and end. ''Maxed Out,'' which has no narrator, gathers facts, opinions and impressions and tosses them into a blender. And its story is still unfinished.Because no spokesman for the lending industry would be interviewed on camera, the closest the film comes to spearing financial sharks is in its bland clips of testimony from a short-lived 2005 Congressional inquiry into banking practices. The glib, well-heeled apologists for legal corporate loan sharking exude the same air of sanctimonious concern bankers have always cultivated.The most carnivorous fish in the movie's net are the young hotshots at a collection agency who gleefully describe pressuring debtors to pay up by threatening to alert their neighbors and relatives and to publish their names in the newspaper.''Maxed Out'' opens with scenes of a Las Vegas real estate agent showing off new mansions and describing the innovative ways in which they are financed. People purchasing these houses in upscale enclaves with pretentious Italian names, she says, expect to have their gated communities patrolled by guards.The scene vividly establishes the notion that consumer debt in America is being driven by a grandiose national sense of material entitlement. Robin Leach muses unhelpfully that people would rather dream about lifestyles of the rich and famous than the poor and unknown. As the film drifts from one topic to the next, it throws in images of post-Katrina New Orleans, a televangelist soliciting donations and a yuppie pawnshop operator showing off his stash of Rolexes. Excerpts from an educational film in which a na&#239;ve couple are lectured on prudent borrowing by a solemn blowhard named Mr. Money adds a strain of deadpan humor.The movie is hostile to President Bush, who is shown urging Americans in the wake of Sept. 11 to do their patriotic duty and spend. Later it is suggested that a law signed by Mr. Bush in 2005 making it more difficult for Americans to apply for bankruptcy was written by MBNA, one of the largest credit companies in the country and a major Bush campaign contributor. Similarly provocative tidbits are scattered throughout the movie, but they remain disconnected.For emotion the movie leans too heavily on the histories of despairing debtors, some facing foreclosure on their homes, others driven to suicide. We hear the story of one woman who drove her car into a river. The mothers of two students who killed themselves describe their thwarted campaign to keep credit card companies from preying on college freshmen.For all its disorganization ''Maxed Out'' still has an impact. The facts speak for themselves. Consumer debt in the United States amounts to more than $2.4 trillion; the debt carried by the median American household is $9,000. When people go into bankruptcy, about two-thirds of what they owe is in interest and penalties, not principal. In its most provocative historical analogy the movie compares the lending industry's predatory practices with sharecropping in the South after the Civil War.There is little in ''Maxed Out'' that hasn't been explored in greater depth and acuity on programs like ''60 Minutes'' and ''Now.'' Yet its gloomy message still resonates. It is as old as the republic whose Constitution enshrines the pursuit of happiness as an inalienable right: In a nation of financial snake oil salesmen, where the almighty dollar rules, greed usually trumps ethics.Maxed Out  Opens today in New York; Austin, Tex.; Dallas; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Seattle; and Washington.Written, produced and directed by James D.

Two signs hung over two doors. ''Bar'' and ''Animal Hair Manufacturing Company.'' I opted for the first and entered.The room was dim and a dozen pale faces were turned my way. A projector hummed in the rear, its beam cutting the gloom like a locomotive headlight. Tinny classical music played. A screen hung next to the door and the Martha Graham Dance Company was doing ''Appalachian Spring'' -- a classic of modern dance, but not what you'd expect to find in what looked like a waterfront joint in the Budd Schulberg mode.As I sat at the bar, Martha Graham was followed by an abstract Stan Brakhage short involving leaves and moth wings, and then by silent cityscapes of 1970s New York made by the projectionist when, as he explained, he was living with a girl who had a peyote habit. O.K. I sipped a boilermaker, taking it all in -- the films, the maritime farrago that cluttered the shelves and walls and the bar owner who resembled Tony Bennett if Tony Bennett had sworn off barbers since 1957.After the movies ended, a spindly, hollow-eyed man announced he was going to sing a song he'd written while living in a Texas basement. The refrain was, ''She's not a vixen, she voted for Richard Nixon.'' What a line! I immediately memorized it and the moment. I did not quite know what to make of this place, but I knew I'd be back.Soon, I was a weekly regular (the bar was open only on Fridays). Sometimes between drinks I crossed the street and dove into the nighttime harbor, a bobbing corpuscle in the city's bloodstream.In time, as the customers multiplied and another hand was needed, I migrated to the other side of the bar. Though I had never meant to tend bar -- books were my ambition -- here I was, serving boilermakers alongside hirsute Tony Bennett. Still, I never mistook this for a job. No, what drew me back after that first night is what has kept me there for 12 years -- people can be just so damn interesting.In Joseph Mitchell's much-read bar-ography of McSorley's saloon, a barkeep said of his former customers back home in Ireland: ''They were like actors in a play, only the play was real. There were Falstaffs among them  and there were Ancient Pistols among them. There were good old souls among those men and there were leeches among them.''I am reminded of that description nearly every Friday. I do not mean that I am constantly eavesdropping on Mametian dialogue and bad behavior. Rather, it is that there is no theater more absorbing to me than the procession of ordinary and extraordinary people who pass through the bar in a night. Some behave badly, some madly, few dully.In my first year, a newly widowed World War II veteran named Frankie Brown often came by early, nursing his hurt and a can of beer he brought with him. When I went out to eat with him one night, the waiter insisted on bringing him a cappuccino -- a drink he had never heard of -- instead of his customary Sanka, and he irritably said, ''Listen, I use small words and few of 'em.'' This was a typical Frankie Brown declaration. Nelson Algren would have followed him around for weeks.For years I have been serving a Bellevue nurse who lost half a finger to an industrial fan while mining its lint for dolls she makes. She likes to dress up the stump on special occasions, say, as a pirate or, during Derby week, as a jockey. Lately, she married a man who, when it suits him, arrives wearing a hat made from a deceased Canada goose that he found along an Ohio road and had taxidermied. The hat's wingspan is wider than the bar door; he enters sideways.Some customers establish their identity over months and years. Some need only a single visit.A goonish union official, bristling with hostility, revealed his true affiliation to me one evening when I mistakenly gave him soda, not water, with his Scotch. ''Get the order right, Spidey,'' he spat. ''This isn't Appalachia.'' Spidey? The rest of the night he called out ''Spidey'' whenever I came near -- a reference, I later figured out, to the hapless waiter taunted and gunned down by a cranky Tommy DeVito in ''Goodfellas.''Wiseguy, cinephile or both, I never challenged him. Scotch does not discourage the violently inclined. Nor the libidinally.Four Octobers ago, a dark-haired woman swung open the door with such theatricality that everyone turned her way. She surveyed the room, and parting the crowd with, well, her looks, she walked straight toward me. Her lips a finger's width from my face, she said: ''I want you to make me a drink and I want you to dance with me. Now.''Tommy Dorsey was on the radio. As we stood in the center of the room, she clung to me so closely she might as well have been behind me. After telling me her name was Nora and that she was here from New Orleans, she never said another word. Talking to her was like talking to the moon; silence was my only answer.When the song ended, I returned to the bar and she lingered for several more drinks before leaving as abruptly as she had arrived, like a fast-moving weather system churning back toward the Gulf.Not all customers who have left their mark are eccentric, eloquent or particularly talkative. Some never said a word. A longtime regular named Diesel, thought to be the largest dog ever to enter a bar, passed away this winter, and though he never caused a stir unless we were out of pretzels, I know he will be remembered for a long time.And for months an all-white cat with chewed-up ears who goes by Icarus has been showing up and walking the length of the bar in search of his owner, Sinjin. Assured that Sinjin is doing nothing more worrisome than drinking warm beer, Icarus will wait for him the entire night perched outside on a car hood, a nine-pound feline sentinel as loyal as Gunga Din.When I was a 10-year-old amateur astronomer I was obsessed with the idea that white dwarf stars were so dense that a handful of white-dwarf-star matter would weigh the equivalent of, say, the Queen Mary. Some nights, after everyone has left and I have cleaned the bar and turned the lights off and the room is silent, I have a similar sense of awe -- of the uncountable lives that have intersected in this small space. Thousands of stevedores, teachers, musicians, crooks, painters, waitresses have stared at these same old murals or at their reflections in the bar-back mirror.I know that some of these people have died or have moved away or have stopped drinking. Many have forgotten their nights here, their petitions, their pronouncements, their come-ons, their rejections, their revelations, but little of it is forgotten by me.The neighborhood is not the same it was in winter 1994. The lupine dogs that once patrolled the grassy lots have disappeared, the waterfront is largely fenced off and developers with an underdeveloped capacity for appreciating Red Hook's small-town feel are now busily leveling the last remaining single-story houses.It is easy to feel elegiac watching this happen, but for me there is still one place where on Friday nights a sense of open-ended possibility persists. A place where anything may happen, where anyone may walk through that door.RITUALS</text></article><article id="1831582"><summary>Memorial service for Vincent Sardi Jr, is scheduled (S)</summary><text>A memorial service for Vincent Sardi Jr., the restaurateur known as the unofficial mayor of Broadway, will be held at noon Tuesday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street in Manhattan.Among the artists who are scheduled to perform or offer reminiscences are the actresses Elaine Stritch and Bebe Neuwirth, the director-producer Harold Prince and the pianist Etsko Tazaki, who is Mr. Sardi's daughter.

Wessell, who as president of Tufts University from 1953 to 1966 guided its transformation from a small college to a respected university, died Sunday near his home in Naples, Fla. He was 92.The death was confirmed by his son, Nils H. Wessell.Dr. Wessell oversaw the conversion of what for 101 years had been Tufts College, in Medford, Mass. On the day he was installed as president, Dec. 9, 1953, he called for Tufts to become a university ''in name as well as in fact.'' In 1955, the Massachusetts Board of Corporations changed Tufts's status.''It was more than a name change,'' Tufts's current president, Lawrence S. Bacow, said in an interview Wednesday. ''It was a commitment to becoming a true research university. That meant developing graduate programs in the colleges of arts, sciences, engineering.''During Dr. Wessell's presidency, biology and chemistry laboratories, an engineering building, new dormitories and the Wessell Library were built, and the Lincoln Filene Center for Public Service and the Experimental College were opened.Previously, Tufts had been a liberal arts college with schools of medicine, dentistry and law. It had 3,500 students when Dr. Wessell became its eighth president, at the age of 39. It now has about 9,000 students.Nils Yngve Wessell was born in Warren, Pa., on April 14, 1914, the son of Nils Johan Wessell, a Congregationalist minister, and Esther Walquist Wessell, a nurse. In addition to his son, of Mystic, Conn., Dr. Wessell is survived by a daughter, Roberta McCuskey of Los Angeles; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His wife of 59 years, the former Marian Sigler, died in 1997.After graduating from Lafayette College in 1934, Dr. Wessell earned a master's in psychology from Brown University in 1935 and a Ph.D. from the University of Rochester in 1938. From 1939 to 1947, he taught psychology at Tufts. Before becoming president, he was the college's dean of liberal arts and its vice president. While serving as president of Tufts, Dr. Wessell led a panel that reviewed the state's prison system.From 1968 to 1979, Dr. Wessell was president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The foundation, established by a former president of General Motors, supports higher education and science research.In 1976, Gov. Hugh L.

She was 64.The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Marta.Mrs. Amaya escaped government soldiers on the morning of Dec. 11, 1981, as they killed all the men, women and children in her village, El Mozote. There and in the surrounding area, the Catholic Office of Human Rights in El Salvador said, 809 victims have now been identified, many found in mass graves.After Rufina Amaya returned to El Salvador from a Honduran refugee camp in 1990, moving to a nearby village, she worked as a lay pastor for the local Roman Catholic church and led what she called ''reflection groups.'' She received a ceaseless stream of visitors from around the world.Again and again, she told of seeing her husband being beheaded and hearing her daughter's mortal scream, after she miraculously found a hiding place.''God saved me because he needed someone to tell the story of what happened,'' she said in 1996 in an interview with The New York Times.Her most significant influence came less than a month after the massacre. Both the Salvadoran and American governments were denying the atrocity, despite protests from church groups and others.After The Times and The Washington Post reported the killings on Jan. 27, 1982, both extensively quoting Mrs. Amaya as well as citing their own observations of human remains, the debate grew sharper. The United States and Salvadoran governments insisted that any dead were probably armed rebels.In 1992 the exhumation of bodies, first those of many children, began. The atrocity could no longer be denied.From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, leftist rebels battled the American-supported Salvadoran government. The Atlacatl Battalion of the Salvadoran Army had been trained by United States military advisers and was fighting guerrillas in northeastern El Salvador.Accounts vary on leftist activity in El Mozote, a village of 20 houses facing a square. Mrs. Amaya recalled that unarmed guerrillas in ragged civilian clothes had once tried to get townspeople to assemble in a church, but few went.''I remember people saying: 'Don't get involved. Let's just live and work and not get involved,' '' she said in 1993 in an interview with The New Yorker.But on Dec. 10, 1981, soldiers arrived in El Mozote, demanding that residents turn over their weapons. When they said they had none, the soldiers killed some people.Mass murder began the next morning. People were pulled from their beds before sunrise and divided into three groups. Men were beheaded; some women were raped. The first child killed was tossed in the air and bayoneted.Mrs. Amaya said at the time in an interview with The Times that she heard her son scream: ''Mama, they're killing me. They've killed my sister. They're going to kill me.''She escaped when she realized nobody was directly watching her. She quickly huddled among pine and crabapple trees behind her house.Her husband, Domingo Claros, a 29-year-old woodcutter, was killed; so were her son Cristino, 9, and her daughters Mar&#237;a Dolores, 5; Mar&#237;a Lilian, 3, and Mar&#237;a Isabel, 8 months.In 1990, Pedro Chicas Romero of La Joya, a nearby hamlet, who had hidden in a cave as soldiers killed his relatives and neighbors, filed a criminal complaint against the Atlacatl Battalion, demanding that its members be punished. Mrs. Amaya was the first to testify.In January 1992, a pact ending the 12-year civil war explicitly exempted the army from human rights prosecutions. Mrs. Amaya complained bitterly about this.''They have never even come to ask our pardon,'' she said in 1996 in an interview with The Times.She married Jos&#233; Natividad in 1985 while living in a refugee camp in Honduras. They were divorced two years later.Besides their daughter Marta, she is survived by another daughter, Fidelia M&#225;rquez, who was not in El Mozote at the time of the massacre, and by her adopted son, Walter Amaya.Jorge &#193;valos, a Salvadoran journalist, remembered visiting El Mozote with Mrs. Amaya in 1992. Amid the ruins and roaming deer, she indicated where bodies would be found.''Here, next to this tree, the young girls were gathered,'' she said.She did not cry. She said she long ago had cried herself dry.Correction:  March 10, 2007, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Rufina Amaya, witness to a massacre in the village of El Mozote in El Salvador, referred incorrectly to the Salvadoran Army's exemption from human rights prosecutions. The possibility of prosecutions ended in 1993 when El Salvador passed a general amnesty law covering anyone implicated in a United Nations investigation, which stemmed from a peace accord in 1992. Impunity was not mandated in that 1992 accord, which ended the country's 12-year civil war.</text></article><article id="1831659"><summary>John J McCabe, newspaper executive, including The New York Times, dies at age 78;</summary><text>John J.

He chased''Moby-Dick'' through much of the 1950s. After writing and starring in ''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed'' in 1955, he made his own film version of that Melville classic for British television before starring in John Huston's. But Welles still wasn't finished, returning to the novel at the end of his life, filming scenes of himself reading it in one of his many unfinished works. (There are remarkable excerpts on YouTube.)Welles may never have caught the big fish in the same way that he captured, say, William Randolph Hearst in ''Citizen Kane,'' but this gripping revival of ''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed,'' presented by Twenty Feet Productions with a Shakespearean sweep, proves that this was a perfect marriage of man and material.It's easy to forget that Welles was first a man of the theater, and this ferocious drama, a poetic examination of one man's obsession, is, among other things, a celebration of the stage. It begins almost offhandedly with a group of actors filing into the theater where they are to perform ''King Lear.''In a light, almost documentary style, Welles satirizes backstage small talk: the complaints about critics, pay and academics. When one performer talks about the need for theater, another corrects him: ''Nobody ever needed the theater -- except us. Have you ever heard of an unemployed audience?''When the vain star (Seth Duerr) enters, he informs the ensemble that they will be performing ''Moby-Dick'' instead of ''Lear,'' and that he will play Ahab. This framing device provides a justification for the bare-bones adaptation (everyone wears casual clothes and mimes the props), but the director, Marc Silberschatz, is smart to avoid hammering home the theatrical themes, since the play-within-a-play conceit has become a clich&#233;.Instead, he concentrates on suspending our disbelief, relying on a direct, simple staging that tells the story with gusto and clarity. The cramped theater, a black box with bad sightlines, actually helps give a sense of being trapped on a rickety ship.Welles, who ruthlessly edited Melville's novel down to two hours, would no doubt have approved of Dana Sterling's moody lighting design. But this play rises and falls on the strength of Ahab, and Mr. Duerr is happily up to the challenge. With sunken eyes that betray a touch of madness, he looks like a man losing a battle but refusing to give up.He doesn't perform off his fellow actors so much as recite his lines to the heavens, which makes perfect sense, since he's playing a dictatorial actor playing a dictatorial captain. At his best, Mr. Duerr's booming baritone even brings to mind Welles himself. Call me impressed.''Moby Dick -- Rehearsed'' continues through March 25 at the Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1831758"><summary>Natalie Bodanya, American soprano who sang at Metr</summary><text>Natalie Bodanya, an American soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1930s and early '40s and who later became a voice teacher, died on Sunday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 98.Her death was announced by her son, Paul Gorman.Natalie Bodanskaya -- she later shortened her name to avoid confusion with the conductor Artur Bodanzky -- was born in Manhattan on Aug. 23, 1908, and grew up in a tenement on the Upper East Side. Her singing attracted the attention of neighbors and an employee of the neighborhood music school, the Union Settlement, who arranged an audition for her with the legendary soprano Marcella Sembrich. Ms. Sembrich was impressed enough to take her under her wing as a student and helped to steer her to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.After graduating from Curtis and seeking a job in New York, Ms. Bodanya had a successful Metropolitan Opera audition with Edward Johnson and landed the role of Micaela in ''Carmen,'' making her debut in the spring season of 1936. She sang with the house for the next five years, sometimes as Micaela or Musetta in Puccini's ''Boh&#232;me,'' but also in smaller roles like Yniold in Debussy's ''Pell&#233;as et M&#233;lisande'' or a page in Wagner's ''Parsifal.'' In 1938 she canceled engagements in Venice and Milan to protest the Italian government's anti-Semitic measures.In 1938 she married William Gorman, a philosophy professor who later collaborated with Mortimer J. Adler. She took a hiatus from performing to have a son, Paul. In addition to her son, she is survived by a granddaughter.In 1944 she returned to the stage with the New York City Opera, where she reprised Musetta and other roles. She made nightclub and radio appearances and recorded a few duets with Mario Lanza.She subsequently retired from singing and worked for many years as a voice teacher based in California; she also visited many colleges to teach scholarship students.Her most notorious moment at the Met came during the company's first performance of ''Il Matrimonio Segreto'' by Cimarosa, in 1937, when she lost her pantaloons onstage during the show and won an ovation for continuing with her aria while kicking them off the stage.</text></article><article id="1831761"><summary>Harry Hurt III Executive Pursuits on learning ballet dancing from Charles Askegard of New York City Ballet; photo (L)a</summary><text>CHARLES ASKEGARD and I crossed Lincoln Center plaza bundled in navy overcoats with tote bags slung over our shoulders like a couple of accountants on a lunch hour exercise break. It was a frigid mid-February afternoon. The winter wind cut through to my already aching middle-age bones. Even Charles, my ultra-fit 38-year-old buddy, a 6-foot-4, 185-pound principal dancer at the New York City Ballet, felt the pain.''This is bad weather for ballet dancers,'' Charles said as we circumnavigated the fountains. ''Back when we had the warm spell around Christmas, things were great. But since it's turned cold, I've gotten tendonitis in my Achilles' tendons.''''I must have tendonitis in my prefrontal lobes,'' I replied, shivering.I reckon only a form of brain damage could have inspired me to embark on the preposterous executive pursuit of trying to learn ballet dancing -- after surviving a stint as quarterback with the New York Jets. And now it was getting serious. Having spent the morning learning some basics, I was going to attempt a specially choreographed 15-second routine with the ballerina who was scheduled to dance on stage that night with Charles.Charles and I ducked into a dressing room on the eighth floor of the Rose Building to change into our ballet clothes. I remembered that George Balanchine, the legendary Russian &#233;migr&#233; choreographer who was a co-founder of the New York City Ballet, had a passionate pas de deux policy: ''In my ballets, woman is first. Men are consorts. God made men to sing the praises of women. They are not equal to men. They are better.''To my chagrin, Charles offered a slightly more male-oriented perspective based on his own dancing experience. ''Ballet is like ballroom dancing: someone has to take the lead,'' he told me. ''When you're partnering, the man is really in the driver's seat. You need to be strong. You have to assert yourself in a very distinct way to give her the support she needs. But you also have to let her shine. I like to give my partners some freedom, so something unexpected can happen.''As if on cue, something unexpected happened within seconds. On our way down a staircase, I saw my dancing partner for the first time. Her name was Jenifer Ringer, and she was curled up on a couch in an alcove off one of the landings with a white down jacket pulled over her like a blanket. As we passed, she blinked open her eyes, groaning.''Rehearsal's at 2:30, right?'' she asked.''Yep,'' Charles replied. ''You're fine. Go back to sleep.''My watch showed 2:02 p.m. civilian time, but as Charles noted, it was almost midnight company time. The New York City Ballet's winter season ran from Nov. 21 to Feb. 25. During that period, the dancers worked out and rehearsed six days a week in precisely timed intervals. The principals performed on stage no less than three days a week, and twice a day on matinee weekends -- all this for top salaries in the $80,000 to $120,000 range.''Everybody's burned out this time of year,'' Charles confided. ''You have to grab a nap whenever you can.''We entered a seventh-floor rehearsal room with a padded gray floor and mirrored walls lined with ballet barres. Charles told me that Jenifer and I would be performing a segment from Act 2 of ''Swan Lake.'' He obligingly refreshed my memory of the storyline.I was Prince Siegfried, and Jenifer was Odette, a beautiful girl who changed into a white swan every night under the spell of the evil magician Von Rothbart. The only way Odette could be freed from the spell was if I swore my love for her. But Von Rothbart was going to trick me into swearing my love for a black swan named Odile, whose part was typically danced by the same ballerina who danced the part of Odette.I thanked the ballet gods that Charles and I were alone as we blocked my moves. It had been embarrassing enough to participate in the company's morning workout class wearing a golf shirt with my black tights. Now I was wearing a baby blue form-fitting performance top Charles had picked out at Capezio Dance Theatre Shop. My reflection in the mirror looked more like a blue-bellied whale than a handsome prince in love with a swan.My anxiety level soared to balletic heights when Jenifer entered the room in a black leotard, and plopped down on the floor to put on her toeshoes. Raised in South Carolina, she had danced with New York City Ballet for over 16 years, touring the world with Charles and the other members of the company. She had a rose-bud mouth, brunette ringlets, and bruised feet bulging with bunions. The first thing she did was wrap her toes with tape. ''It's because of the friction,'' she explained. ''Sometimes you get blisters.''''Charles says I'm in love with you, and I'm filled with longing,'' I informed her.''And I'm a little scared of you,'' Jenifer replied in character.I didn't blame her. Our routine was fraught with potential pitfalls. She was to begin lying on the floor bent forward from the waist like a sleeping swan. I was to walk over, take her by the wrists with my thumbs and middle fingers, and raise her onto the tips of her toeshoes so that she was balanced en pointe. She would lower her left arm, and pirouette to the right. I would grasp her waist as she tilted forward and to the left in an arabesque pench&#233;.Then Jenifer would walk away three steps to the right. I would catch up, grasp her waist, guide her through another arabesque tilting forward and to the right, and promenade her around in a circle. She would walk away three steps to the left. I would grasp her by the waist once again, and lift her off the floor in a loving climax.But as I discovered in our prerehearsals, simply walking across the floor in time with a tape recording of Tchaikovsky's score was problematic. I was accustomed to walking heel-toe. Ballet dancers walk toe-heel, which is roughly like trying to tiptoe on egg shells. I could hear myself gasping and wheezing with every step.Jenifer's lithe leg strength made it relatively easy for me to raise her en pointe. Keeping her there was another matter. Time and again, I tipped her off balance by pulling her too far back toward me.''I'm afraid that I'm going to push you down on your nose,'' I apologized.''You won't,'' Jenifer assured. ''But if you do, that's O.K. Then I won't have to dance tonight.''My efforts at executing the lift were even more laughable. As Charles explained, the trick was to gain the power and momentum to raise Jenifer up by first doing a pli&#233;, the ballet equivalent of a deep knee bend. Jenifer barely weighed 100 pounds. But in the wake of the morning workout class, my knees were about as flexible as a two-by-four and my arms felt about as muscular as wet bathroom tissue.Somehow, we managed two formal run-throughs of our routine before Jenifer had to rush off to a 3 p.m. rehearsal with a real ballet dancer. I experienced several nanoseconds of sheer joy and exhilaration when I was able to keep her en pointe: it was, in ''Swan Lake'' terms, like flying alongside the most graceful bird under the sun. In the end, I was relieved that neither of us broke a wing or a leg.That evening, I watched Charles and Jenifer perform ''Intermezzo No. 1'' by Eliot Feld at the New York State Theater. For the first time, I could truly appreciate the artistry and athleticism demanded by their magnificent pli&#233;s, pirouettes, leaps and lifts. I went backstage, and gave Jenifer a congratulatory hug. Then Charles and I slung our tote bags over our shoulders like a couple of accountants who'd just completed a routine audit, and went out for a couple of beers.PERSONAL BUSINESS: EXECUTIVE PURSUITS</text></article><article id="1831772"><summary>Excerpts from interview with American Eagle Outfitters' chief executive James V O'Donnell on future of retailer; photo (M)0</summary><text>When the greeter calls ''Have a Great Day!'' as you leave -- his smile glinting with silver braces -- you know you're in yet another chain catering to the under-30 crowd.But there is a difference between this store and the other mall shops full of rumpled khakis and pique knits: American Eagle Outfitters has been getting it right for years and despite a bit of a slowdown after the Christmas holiday season, ''the superb execution continues; raising estimates and price target,'' Goldman Sachs said in a report issued on Thursday.The stock rose to just over $34 in mid-January from a bit over $18 in March 2006. It ticked down to a little under $29 earlier this week, more because of the winter blahs than recent market upheavals, but then was back to $30.26 at the close yesterday.James V. O'Donnell, 66, American Eagle's chief executive for the last three and a half years, was asked the big question: Where is the company, with $2.8 billion in sales in 2006, heading now? The interview took place in his New York office on Monday. On Thursday, American Eagle transferred from the Nasdaq exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, and Mr. O'Donnell rang the opening bell. Following are excerpts:Q. As I understand it, American Eagle's biggest challenge now is with its knit tops.A. For 2007, the question is what are we going to do with knits. We're targeting two major categories. We're going after new fabrications -- when they grab that knit top they've got to feel softness and be in a really cool color. We'll keep our prices at $15.50, $17.50 and $19.50, although we'll experiment with some at $24.50.Q. Some analysts think some of your prices are already too high.A. The $24.50 is only because we're experimenting with some new fabrics. We are not and will never be in the $59.50, $69.50 category.Q. And the other major category you're revamping?A. Accessories. That's the next major frontier. We've gone in and out of accessories and I will take the criticism for that. We've never had a sole accessories designer -- when the sweater season was over, we borrowed the sweater designer, that kind of thing. Now we have one.Q. What do you mean by accessories? Bags?A. Yes, the young ladies tell us they like our bags, which were mostly fabric. Now we're going to be dealing with leather and leather trim. We're also getting into hair accessories.Q. You can't make a lot of money from barrettes, though, can you?A. Well, it rounds out the selection; it could be a big draw. It also keeps your value equation in line.Q. So that's the American Eagle chain. What about your two stores: Aerie, which is a lingerie chain, and Martin &amp; Osa, designed for more mature men and women. Aerie is going well, but haven't there been problems, a rocky start, to Martin &amp; Osa. Are you satisfied with M.&amp; O.?A. Yes and no. We sent research teams in November and December: men and women, all of the targeted age. They liked the ease of shopping; that the associates were friendly -- we have oversize dressing rooms, you know. But they concluded that while the men's were on trend, the women's selections were too outdoorsy and inconsistent. So we've made more changes: the silhouettes are more flattering. They also thought the price points were too high. We've looked at the pricing, and I've moved some down. I wanted to see some things at $40 that last fall would've been at $70. Our bottoms business also was not to my liking.Q. How will you get the style right?A. We took the top person in charge of technical specifications out of American Eagle, that is to say, fit. She's heading up all the new size blocks for M.&amp; O. The old size blocks were too boxy, and the fits were not consistent: some were great, some weren't. It was a little embarrassing.Q. You mentioned a third concept for a store. Is it about children?A. Well, there is an opportunity there. I don't know if we'll go after it. But if we did it -- and I'm not saying we will -- it certainly wouldn't be a shrunken American Eagle.An extended version of this interview is at nytimes.com/business.SATURDAY INTERVIEW</text></article><article id="1831803"><summary>Photo shows Francis J Harvey, who was forced to resign as secretary of Army, at farewell ceremony at Fort Myer, Va</summary><text /></article><article id="1831812"><summary>Maian R Stuart letter holds that money to treat our wounded should come from Defense Dept budget (Paul D Eaton March 6 Op-Ed)</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Casualties of the Budget Wars,'' by Paul D.

Stuart  Morristown, N.J., March 6, 2007</text></article><article id="1831820"><summary>Revisiting Ov</summary><text>It was the last Monday in February, and another Utah legislative session was coming to a close. A group of lobbyists, legislators and state officials were meeting to hash out the merits of a controversial bill. Among those in the room was our old friend Patrick M. Byrne, the chief executive of Overstock.com, the struggling Internet retailer based in Salt Lake City.Yes, dear reader, we are returning to Utah this week. You will perhaps recall that we last visited that great state in early summer. Our interest had been piqued by another piece of legislation, passed during a brief special session, that took aim at the practice of ''naked short selling.'' You will perhaps also recall that Mr. Byrne has been crusading for several years about the evils of naked short sellers, seeing something in the practice that few others see: a conspiracy to destroy upstanding companies like his own, and rob unsuspecting investors.Shares of Overstock, for instance, have dropped from $76 to the mid-teens in a little more than two years. (Overstock closed yesterday at $17.51.) Could this be because the company has never come close to making money? (Last year, it lost $96.9 million.) Nah. Must be those rotten naked short sellers.Never mind that most people on Wall Street, or most regulators, for that matter, don't believe that there is much naked short selling going on. (A typical short seller, who is betting that a stock is going to decline, borrows shares at a high price and then buys them when the price drops, pocketing the difference. A naked short seller, on the other hand, doesn't bother to borrow the shares within the allotted settlement period.)And never mind that the means by which Utah was going to stomp out naked short selling was highly technical -- revolving around something called ''failure to deliver''-- and that it was even questionable whether a large number of ''failures to deliver'' meant that naked short selling was the cause. The bill would have allowed Utah companies to discover who was failing to deliver their shares -- and then sue them for damages. That, of course, had Mr. Byrne licking his chops. Indeed, he was the driving force behind the original legislation.After the law was signed, the Securities Industry Association vowed to file suit on the ground that Utah was trying to do something that was the purview of the federal government. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors failures to deliver, let it be known that it would side with the industry association.But Utah remained unbowed. ''If we create a model here, it will raise the profile of this issue, and perhaps get others talking about it, and even doing something about it,'' Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. told me at the time. State Senator Curtis S. Bramble, who sponsored the legislation, called naked short selling a form of ''market manipulation.''Well, that was then. The new bill, which was introduced just days before the February meeting was also sponsored by Senator Bramble. But it would repeal his own earlier legislation. In the intervening months, the industry association (which had since been renamed the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) had filed suit as promised, and once the state's lawyers took a close look at the merits of the case, they saw they had a losing hand.In addition, Mr. Byrne was said to have told the political powers-that-be that other companies would come in behind Overstock to support the new law. It never happened. (In an e-mail exchange I had with him -- soon to be posted on the Overstock Web site, I'm told -- Mr. Byrne denied promising anything of the sort, while also asserting that other companies did support the bill. ''Whoever is providing this version to you is lying on two fronts,'' he wrote.)Senator Bramble was clearly furious. He told The Associated Press that he now believed that Overstock's motives were ''highly suspect.'' He added: ''There are those who believe Overstock has been using the Legislature as a distraction against its own problems. It raises serious questions.''Mr. Byrne, in turn, publicly called Senator Bramble ''a squish'' and a ''yellow belly.''So, back to the meeting. As it became clear that Mr. Byrne had no support, and the law was going to be repealed, he first offered to finance the state's defense himself. No, he was told, the state had to bear the cost for its own litigation. Then, he became increasingly agitated, accusing Senator Bramble of betraying him. As his tone became more belligerent, and he began cursing, most of the others in the room, their jaws agape, simply listened to him rant. Several of them later told me they had never heard anything like it.After the meeting, a confrontation broke out between Mr. Byrne and a securities industry lobbyist. (Mr. Byrne denies that he used foul language, or that things got too out of hand.)Needless to say, Utah no longer has a law to stop naked short selling. Though no one will say so publicly, the word is that Utah officials now feel they were snookered by the Overstock C.E.O. And that his behavior at that meeting further damaged his credibility. And that, even though he is one of the state's largest political donors, he is going to have a hard time ever getting the Legislature to take him seriously again. As Gary Weiss, the author of ''Wall Street Versus America'' and one of Mr. Byrne's most vocal critics, put it to me recently, ''We are watching, in real time, a guy in the midst of a meltdown.''I think his whole crusade is in meltdown. True, the S.E.C. has proposed a few new rules about ''failures to deliver,'' but those rules were in the works well before the Utah legislation was passed. And the agency doesn't even really believe that the failures to deliver and naked short selling are particularly connected. Mr. Byrne's Internet ramblings have lost much of their ''oh my goodness'' factor, so they don't get the attention they once did. A Web site, antisocialmedia.net, which attacked critics of Mr. Byrne and Overstock, was exposed by an Internet sleuth as being run by an Overstock official. Recently, Overstock filed a ridiculous $3.5 billion suit against 10 big Wall Street firms, asserting that they were aiding and abetting the naked short sellers. He is becoming harder and harder to take seriously. I can't help thinking that there are a lot of people who must feel like Senator Bramble -- they once believed Patrick Byrne and now they're wondering why.Which is not to say that I don't still think he's dangerous. It has always seemed to me that Mr. Byrne's primary mission had less to do with the supposed evils of naked short sellers, and more to do with making life miserable for anyone who dared to criticize his company.Consider, for instance, his lawsuit against Gradient Analytics, the small independent research outfit that was early and prescient in its criticism of Overstock, and David Rocker, a short seller who was equally critical. Thanks to the noise generated by Mr. Byrne and his allies the S.E.C. spent over a year investigating Gradient and Mr. Rocker, looking into the accusations that they were manipulating Overstock's stock. A few weeks ago, the agency sent Gradient a letter saying that it would not pursue an action against the firm.Yet Gradient and Mr. Rocker, who recently retired, still have to defend themselves against a lawsuit from Overstock itself, which could run for years. (Gradient and Mr. Rocker tried to get it tossed out as a frivolous lawsuit. A judge declined to dismiss the suit, a decision that is currently being appealed.) And Gradient is being sued as well by another small company, Biovail, which also accuses it of being involved in a stock manipulation scheme. To its credit, Gradient has continued to publish tough-minded reports on companies, but the litigation hardly fosters an environment that encourages truly independent research -- or vocal short sellers.Indeed, most shorts have gone underground because they don't want to be sued. That's terrible for the market, which needs to hear contrary views. It's also terrible for the regulators, who get many of their best leads, as opposed to the ones Overstock throws its way, from short sellers.And then there's the Internet, where Mr. Byrne and his chief ally, a man who uses the pseudonym Bob O'Brien, go after anyone who disagrees with them. (To get a flavor of Mr. O'Brien's belligerent style, and his response to questions, check out his Web site, thesanitycheck.com, where he has posted a Q.&amp; A. with me that took place this week.)Mr. O'Brien is as fanatical about naked short selling as Mr. Byrne, but he also spends time on other message boards. For years, one of his favorite stocks has been NovaStar, the subprime lender that recently collapsed, which Mr. O'Brien has touted endlessly, while attacking anyone who disagreed. He once even went so far as to publish a thinly veiled threat aimed at the family of Marc Cohodes, who was at the time Mr. Rocker's partner. There are clearly people who stuck with NovaStar because of Mr. O'Brien -- and have lost a lot of money. Wouldn't they have been better off if they had been able to hear the bear view of NovaStar?There is one other important person who appears to have lost faith in Mr. Byrne lately. That's a man named John A. Fisher, a former executive at the old Hambrecht &amp; Quist investment bank, who now runs his own boutique firm.A few weeks ago, Mr. Fisher resigned from the Overstock board, saying that he could not go along with Mr. Byrne's decision to sue the big Wall Street firms. The Overstock board is now down to four directors, two of them insiders. In an S.E.C. filing, the company said it would work quickly to find some new independent directors.Any takers?TALKING BUSINESSCorrection:  March 13, 2007, Tuesday  The Talking Business column in Business Day on Saturday, about a campaign by Patrick M. Byrne, the chief executive of Overstock.com, against a type of short selling, referred incorrectly to David Rocker, a short seller and former head of Rocker Partners. Mr. Rocker and his firm were not the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible manipulation of Overstock.com shares. (Mr. Rocker did testify in the course of an S.E.C. investigation of similar accusations against Gradient Analytics, a research firm. The S.E.C. recently sent a letter to Gradient saying that it would not pursue any action against the firm.)</text></article><article id="1831847"><summary>March 9 obituary about Rufina Amaya referred incorrectly to Salvadoran Army's exemption from human rights prosecutions</summary><text>An obituary yesterday about Rufina Amaya, witness to a massacre in the village of El Mozote in El Salvador, referred incorrectly to the Salvadoran Army's exemption from human rights prosecutions.

My mother was a coach, and my brother and I grew up doing laps -- I even won a few school competitions. I still try to practice as much as possible, so it was very exciting when the collaboration between Balenciaga and Arena came up. I've always felt that swimwear needs to be approached like any other article of clothing. Just as sometimes you want to wear a parka and other times a short jacket, you should be able to choose between long, baggy shorts and smaller swimsuits. When I'm relaxing on the beach, I usually prefer trunks; butthere is also something very cool about wearing a brief, tight suit -- it reminds me of Bruce Weber's imagery. Someone recently told me that small, athletic bathing suits were very controversial when they were invented in the early 1960s; they were considered indecent and overly provocative, which seems crazy. Even though they are perfectly acceptable nowadays, I don't think that everyone can wear them -- you need to take really good care of your body, or at least make sure that you have a flat stomach. But if you pull it off, the results can be amazing: when a well-designed bathing suit is worn on a well-kept body, it becomes an object of great power.</text></article><article id="1831935"><summary>S S Fair column on Campari, Italian aperitif, and cocktails made with it; drawing (M)</summary><text>The Samurai Sipper does not on principle parade her family around like sock puppets at preschool. But how else to salute Campari, the classic aperitivo, without mentioning the Samurai Spouse? Born on Riverside Drive, weaned in the San Fernando Valley, the Spouse spent his preteen years on Via Statilio Tauro on the outskirts of Rome. Home-schooled by his Canadian mother, the Spouse scavenged and sold scrap metal for a fistful of lire, ate horse meat without censure and lugged straw baskets home from the neighborhood osteria, where chianti flowed from spigots. His father, an American opera singer born in Shanghai to a Russian mother, was a basso, meaning he played tough guys, which for him was not a stretch. The Spouse, too, is tough, silent but fierce, an &#252;ber-Samurai. He handily wins the prize for the most cosmopolitan man in Manhattan.Naturally he scorns girly drinks: no cosmopolitans or Manhattans pass his lips. He's been a Campari metrosexual ever since his ship hit New York Harbor. Arriving the first day of school in Queens in short pants, he had the mortadella beaten out of him, undoubtedly driving him to drink. For him, Campari is la dolce vita, la donna &#232; mobile (''woman is fickle'') and the prelude to many a lombata di vitello. The Spouse takes Campari in an icy glass, with a splash of siphoned soda and a twist -- exactly as they do in Rome. And everyone knows that, when in Rome. . . .Campari wasn't born in the Eternal City but in Milan, where the master drink maker Gaspare Campari founded the company in 1860 and began selling his oneiric brew of herbs, aromatics, quinine bark, peels, etc. Only one man at Campari's factory in Novi Ligure knows the exact formulation, and he's not talking. But it does contain wormwood, which has the same active substance as absinthe, the zillion-proof swill that Van Gogh allegedly drank prior to donating part of an ear to posterity. La donna may be mobile, but artists are molto pazzi (crazy). Luckily for humanity, Campari drinkers tend toward bottom pinching rather than rampant ear chopping.Campari's a bitter; drink it neat, and it will bite. The Sipper loves its bitterness, especially mixed with any citrus. Campari tingles the taste buds and issues travel alerts to the stomach that food is en route. It's a spirit-based aperitif, not a wine-based one like Lillet. And it's as red as Dorothy's shoes. (The color used to come from a dye sourced from beetles, making Campari the original Beetlejuice.) It doesn't taste the same here as it does in Italy, but what does? But with the revival in retro cocktails, a new generation of lounge lizards is drinking this old aperitivo in many new guises -- and in many new places.At the grand (but not grandiose) Bar Seine in the H&#244;tel Plaza Ath&#233;n&#233;e, on East 64th Street, my bartender gladly spiked a garden-variety mimosa (Champagne + O.J.) with Campari -- to savory effect. Add leather floors and Moroccan mirrors over leopard ottomans, and the amorously inclined will be altogether stoked.After a marathon shopping safari, the Samurai Sipper headed for the Bar, inside the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel, on 57th Street, where the well-heeled nursed their Silly Gooses: Grey Goose Vodka L'Orange, blood orange pur&#233;e and Campari on silver trays with icy shakers holding seconds; a side of intensely flavored dried cherries adds even more punch. The lounge does Singapore Slings and Harvey Wallbangers, too, but nostalgia's not an option in such postmodern surroundings.Flatiron Lounge, 37 West 19th Street, is dark, Deco, lite-FM jazzy; there, mixologists really go for broke. Eden is a paradise of Plymouth Gin, lemon, rose syrup, Campari; Siesta is Campari with tequila, fresh lime and grapefruit. One part Campari to one part whatever other liquor you fancy is the general rule in my house.Pegu Club, 77 West Houston Street, is another lushly lit, atmospherically swell style magnet. Billie Holiday accompanies the low-key hum of happy-hour players. Audrey Saunders, a celebrated mixologist often in residence, can be persuaded to do Campari ''flights'' for skeptics who haven't sampled better living through alchemy. The Cornwall Negroni is gin, Campari, Punt e Mes, sweet vermouth and utterly wicked. Add minuscule orders of summer rolls, and picture yourself on a boat on a river.The most incomparable Camparis were at 202 in the Chelsea Market, on Ninth Avenue. The Sipper found Stefan Trummer, Austrian barista extraordinaire, who invented three new cocktails on the spot that hit the spot: the Sipper Special is Campari, sugar cane syrup, a squeeze of lime and White Star Champagne (sweeter than Brut and with more depth), and a dash of Sicilian mandarin orange oil; the Spice Girl, which is mandarin-infused vodka and Grand Marnier, spiced cranberry pur&#233;e and White Star; and the Rising Star is, well, let's just say by then the Sipper was singing ''Rigoletto'' in pig Latin while swinging from the rafters. Next time you're in 212, head over to 202 and find Stefan after 4 p.m. Tell him the Sipper sent you.Samurai Shopper</text></article><article id="1831936"><summary>Lucha Loco, new photography book by Malcolm Venville, celebrates Mexican phenomenon of lucha libre, free-style wrestling; photo (S)</summary><text>The Mexican phenomenon of lucha libre -- Spanish for ''freestyle wrestling'' -- is more than just WWE en Espa&#241;ol.

But if designers have their way, grown men could be revisiting their preteens. Thom Browne's shrunken tailoring probably sparked the revival; last year he even showed gray flannel shorts suits for ice-skating. Now others have zeroed in, albeit in more relaxed ways: Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton and Dsquared are teaming shorts with casual jackets and sandals or loafers. It was British soldiers in 19th-century India who first bared their legs by cutting off their pants; soon after, shorts were standard issue for British uniforms in tropical climates. Wealthy Americans in Bermuda became familiar with the look, and by the mid-1930s, stylish men of means wore navy sports jackets with white tennis shorts off court and double-breasted blazers with gray flannel shorts for sailing or drinks at the yacht club.After World War II, things became more democratic. Casual summer shorts popped up on campuses (often worn with jackets), and returning veterans embraced them as the perfect uniform for mowing the lawn. A few brave retailers even tried to sell ''businessman's special'' three-piece shorts suits, but, thanks in part to air-conditioning, the idea mercifully never caught on. By the '60s, stodgy shorts had given way to hip cutoff jeans. In our own era of stylistic appropriation, anyof these versions just might work, handled properly. For creative types, tailored Bermudas and an unlined jacket in summer seem the height of style. One conceit we'd rather not endorse: the preppy custom of exchanging vows at a garden wedding, in jacket, bow tie, shorts and knee socks. A marriage that begins like that is bound to end badly.ROBERT E.

''James Dean's car crash,'' says the designer Alessandro Tomassetti, ''is a metaphor for that facade breaking down.'' In his gas-guzzling designs, dress shirts have the gusseted armholes or zipped sleeves of motorcycle jackets; jeans are made of linen denim that's meant to mimic crushed metal. All Purpose, the West Hollywood shop that Tomassetti opened with Alon Rosenfeld, commissions designers to riff on the car-culture theme: Anita Hopkins's straw fedoras are woven with checkers like speedway flags, and necklaces by Chris Habana are made of mangled, torched chains. Tomassetti and Rosenfeld believe that the average T-shirt devotee can handle a sculptural flourish or two. ''Men's wear moves at a snail's pace,'' Tomassetti says, ''and I just feel like guys are not that stupid.''STEFFIE NELSON  THE REMIX</text></article><article id="1831944"><summary>Men's wear designers embrace rave culture; photo (M)</summary><text>Remember glow sticks, whistles and ''reaching for the lasers''?

But it's in London, where the scene arguably originated, that rave is being most ecstatically embraced.

He was so devoted to biking that, for the epic chase scene toward the end of ''The Great Escape,'' he actually played one of the Nazis racing after his character. He was also -- no surprise -- extremely concerned with looking the part. His label of choice? Belstaff. The company reinvented the biker jacket in 1924, when it pioneered the use of waterproof, breathable wax cotton. But Belstaff coats are more than just practical: they have an &#233;lan that gives ordinary guys King of Cool status. So it made sense for the company's owners, the Malenotti family, to buy McQueen's Belstaff Trialmaster at auction last November for $32,000.The brand's relationship with movie stars is still revving high. When Hollywood needs rough-and-tumble duds, Belstaff gets the call. Brad Pitt (and Angelina), George Clooney and Tom Cruise have all fashioned themselves as latter-day McQueens at some point. Clooney has a wardrobe full of them; Cruise's custom-designed Belstaff in ''Mission: Impossible III'' was arguably the best thing in the movie and quickly became a best seller. Bad guys wear Belstaff, too: Kevin Spacey, as Lex Luthor, wore a parka with fox-fur trim in ''Superman Returns.'' Even the literati use Belstaff as a signifier for cool: the middle-aged real estate agent in Richard Ford's ''The Lay of the Land'' makes a point of letting you know it's his brand.The best place to see Belstaff in action is in ''The Aviator,'' where the jacket got almost as much play as Leonardo DiCaprio. (After all, the film won an Academy Award for costume design.) DiCaprio's looks were based on pieces from the 1920s and '30s, which were then produced for the public and sold as a new line called Aviator by Belstaff. Devotees went crazier than Howard Hughes in a private screening room.Wearing Belstaff doesn't make you look like you stepped out of a period piece. In the coming ''I Am Legend,'' Will Smith plays the last survivor on earth. His jacket isn't the fruit of some futurist's imagination; it's the good old Trialmaster, McQueen's favorite, which remains unchanged from its original incarnation. The implication is that a Belstaff jacket is strong enough to withstand not just the passing of time but also apocalyptic annihilation.The Talk</text></article><article id="1831951"><summary>Herbert Muschamp article on Battistoni, celebrated tailor in Rome; drawing (M)</summary><text>Eighteenth-century philosophers would have supported this move. The education of taste in all forms was a pivotal project for Enlightenment thinkers. They applied it to dress, cuisine and interior decoration as well as to opera, architecture and painting. I am reminded of their enlightened outlook when I go shopping for neckties at Battistoni, the celebrated tailor in Rome.Battistoni makes the handsomest ties in the universe. You don't need a degree in philosophy to wear one. All that's required is the ability to tie a decent knot. I hope to master that masculine art one day. Alas, I have found it difficult to concentrate on practicing it because for me a Battistoni tie represents an altogether different kind of knot: what philosophers call the problem of the One and the Many.Is there an underlying unity beneath the multiplicity of life's forms? Philosophers have long despaired of finding a solution to this problem. Their pessimism has not, however, deterred scientists from continuing the search for a grand unified theory. String theory, which envisions a universe made of vibrating cords of energy, is the latest contender for a solution.Shoppers for men's wear should not be discouraged, either. Even if we cannot solve the problem, we can at least live the problem, and live it well, provided we know where to shop. ''The Elegant Universe'' is the title Brian Greene gave his popular book about string theory.Let us ponder a possible sequel on the subject of thread theory. We will call it Universal Elegance. Battistoni will be the laboratory for our cosmic research.The shop is easy to miss. All along Via Condotti, the shop windows of Prada, Gucci, Ferragamo and other luxury emporiums thrust their latest flashy wares in your face, but Battistoni is entered discreetly through a dim courtyard. You have to know that it's there or, better yet, have a passion for investigating courtyards. Why, another Sainte Chappelle might be lurking back there! However will you know if you don't check it out?The inconspicuous entrance suits Battistoni's sartorial aesthetic. Founded in 1946, this is a house of classic, understated clothing that flies well under fashion's radar. Its sense of tact harks back to the rage for all things British that overtook Italy and other European nations in the 19th century, when the English stood for the efficient administration of modern progress. The shop's rooms have a clubby look. Coats of arms adorn the packaging of glossy, race-car red.Guglielmo Battistoni, the founder, started out as a shirtmaker, and the store is still best known for shirts, ties and suits, though the merchandise also includes sportswear and the usual accessories. An adjacent annex sells women's clothes, though, like shoes and hats, they belong to an alternative to the universe we are here to study. Our universe is the Uniform. It is governed by the trinity of suit, shirt and tie. Once you assent to this standard tripartite version of the One, an infinitude of the Many awaits.Firmaments of patterns. Galaxies of weaves. Colorful clouds of interstellar dust. Species of collars, cuffs and lapels. A fossil record of pearl buttons, reptile-skin belts, woods and ambers distilled into fragrances that evoke the forest primeval. There are even black holes down which entire lines of silk neckties disappear without a trace. Oh, what has become of my beautiful flock of little pelicans flying across a background of navy twill? Gone!Any haberdasher can take you on a fantastic voyage through the galaxies of taste's inner space. What makes Battistoni so interstellar? For one thing, the label hasn't been franchised. Though Barneys carries a selection of Battistoni clothing, you must go to Rome to immerse yourself in the full course of Battistoni's thread theory.And once you're in Rome, the truth will dawn that Italians could not make themselves look British, no matter how hard they try.They can't keep the libido down long enough to make a convincing show of rectitude. The Italian version of a suit designed to conceal the body will make any man look like Adonis.Think of Gina Lollobrigida in that hilarious scene in ''Beat the Devil'' where she tries to seduce an Englishman by serving him tea. The tray is perfectly set. The lady's garden hat is flawless. Now, if only her torso would stop wriggling as she coos, ''Tea for two and two for tea!''Icons</text></article><article id="1831953"><summary>Suzy Menkes article on futurism in men's fashions; photos (M)</summary><text>Is the future as yellow as a newborn chick? Or does it come in space-age silver?Whatever your color preference, futurism melded with a dash of made-to-measure tailoring (think Savile Row meets ''Star Trek'') is next season's story for men's wear.The problem with futurism in fashion is that we've seen it all before. When, for its fall/winter '07 show, Dolce &amp; Gabbana sent out giant gilded overalls to be worn over a basic office suit, or when Calvin Klein offered up a glazed gray leather top and pants, these clothes seemed just another version of back to the future. We are talking about a recap of images that started with the moon landing in the 1960s and have appeared in every intergalactic movie since.It is no coincidence that fashion's more dynamic designers, like Balenciaga's Nicolas Ghesqui&#232;re, who jump-started retro-futurism in women's wear for spring, are mostly of the ''Star Wars'' generation, coming to maturity in the '80s. Miuccia Prada, always one to do things differently, had her own take on the future that was fluffier but at the same time more savage looking: mohair tunics in Easter-chick yellow, as weird as anything Prada ever sent down the runway, but still another iteration of fashion's long star trek.Even the most brilliant imaginations, like George Orwell's and Stanley Kubrick's, had trouble embracing the look of the future. But now that life has taken on a more Orwellian cast, technology seems less scary than it did before. In fact, our glacial high-tech world has become so cozy that the only real shock would be having to part from it.Yet slick and shiny seem more difficult to love in your closet than on your desk. A metallic bag or a silver belt are desirable accents to tailoring. But as a total look, silver is trickier.The acquiring male will find that the future is mostly concealed in a cocoon of the familiar. One breakthrough was surely the many variations of the iPod jacket (there's even an iPod tie by Thomas Pink), with the music machine tucked into an inside pocket but wired to be manipulated on the jacket's exterior. Significantly, Ermenegildo Zegna, which commercialized that jacket, has a tech team dedicated to inventing things you always knew you wanted, like a suit treated to repel the cup of latte you just flung over it or a superlight outerwear jacket with breathable ''pores'' that open and close with the temperature.The significance of the above items is that they are not bathed in a shimmering gloss. They look like ordinary suits or jackets but have high-tech capabilities. Isn't that really the futuristic fashion that everybody wants? Clothes that work as hard as you do. That includes a Moncler parka, first designed for Olympic skiers, that is puffy and warm but ultralightweight; and a jacket by the same company that reverses from slick urban gray to a primary color so lifesavers can find you after an avalanche (when you're probably already dead).It is surprisingly difficult for even a fashion editor to find out about the technical innovations that could really change our wardrobes. Labels tend to focus on care and cleaning, with fabric details that are mysterious to decode. Ask the staff in a luxury boutique for a crease-resistant jacket or a genuinely waterproof coat and you are treated as a sad loser who doesn't get high fashion. And you can bet that anyone who invests in these techno-clothes does not make them a unique talking point with colleagues and friends.Why do we prefer the vision of fake futurism to its exciting reality? After all, many sleek looks now on the runway are remakes of Helmut Lang's modernist vision of the early '90s. Put on sports pants, a silver jacket and sneakers and you are wearing an outfit that made the designers Andr&#233; Courr&#232;ges and Pierre Cardin seem like crazy men, rather than visionaries, a few decades ago.The gleaming, space-age image emanating from a silver raincoat is fallacious. There is no hint of any real technology, like fabrics that change radically with the temperature, and that could conceivably revolutionize the way you travel: life as a sober gray jacket, suitably discreet for a seminar, that blushes crimson once you enter a crowded bar. The real challenge for designers is not to re-costume ''Star Wars'' but to offer clothes that, while they may not physically shine, perform so brilliantly that they add luxury to life.Past Present</text></article><article id="1831955"><summary>Influence of Ray Petri, men's fashion stylist, remains strong 15 years after his death; photos (L)</summary><text>It's a testament to the stylist Ray Petri's genius that more than 15 years after his death, his influence is everywhere. At the spring shows, his spirit turned up in collections as diverse as D&amp;G (tribal power), Alexander McQueen (Harlem dandies) and Junya Watanabe (sports gear as high fashion). Even his personal uniform of dark jeans, bomber jacket and porkpie hat has recently been sighted in Lower Manhattan, Omotesando and Hoxton Square.''Ray Petri is an inspiration for most people in men's wear,'' says the designer Kim Jones, who, like Petri, makes a point of routinely exploring offbeat cultural signifiers. ''He worked with a loyal group of people to create a new aesthetic, and his references were so on target that they are still relevant today. This is extremely rare in fashion, where everything seems to move so quickly.''Ray Petrie (he later dropped the ''e'') was born in Scotland in 1948. When he was 15, he moved with his family to Brisbane, Australia, where he formed a band, the Chelsea Set, playing R&amp;B and Motown. But Australia felt provincial, and in 1969 he landed in London, where he experimented with ambisexual liaisons, swinging parties and the requisite interest in Eastern religion. During his spare time, he kept a jewelry booth at the Camden street market and took classes at Sotheby's to learn about antiques.By the early 1980s, the English scene had grown to resemble a supermarket of style -- punk, new wave, dandyism and sportswear converged on the street -- and Petri found his calling as a new kind of fashion arbiter. His passion was for overseeing everything about the creation of a photograph, except actually snapping the picture. Instead of using models and the buff blonds of the time, he cast teenagers, often of mixed descent, to wear designer clothes that he paired with underwear, vintage pieces and athletic basics best suited for bicycle messengers. The resulting look was unflinchingly tough and sexually charged.''Ray created an entire personal world,'' recalls the photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino.''He was obsessed with 'bad boys,' Jamaican culture and Native American imagery, and was always surrounded by a crowd of beautiful people. It was a true collective -- in a way it reminded me of the Surrealist movement, but everyone was cool and relaxed. We would sit around listening to music, smoking a joint, and ideas would just come to us.''Mondino, who over the years collaborated with Petri on projects ranging from a David Bowie video to editorial spreads and commercials, sees him more as a designer than a stylist. ''He reshaped clothes to create silhouettes that simply didn't exist at the time,'' he says. ''He loved the idea of classic Italian tailoring done in a Caribbean way. From the front, the boys appeared effortlessly dressed, but in the back they were completely pinned, tucked and taped. Ray was obsessed with extra-long shirt sleeves, so he would cut them off at the shoulder and reattach them with big safety pins so that they stuck out under suit jackets.'' On occasion, he would even spray models with cologne during shoots.Some of Petri's more daring sartorial propositions, like boxer shorts and combat boots worn on their own under a trench coat, were clearly not the stuff of everyday life. Still -- or perhaps precisely because of that -- his vision had a profound effect on the culture at large. Pace-setting magazines like The Face, i-D and Arena embraced his work, and his circle of collaborators expanded considerably. Besides Mondino, regular members included the designer Jean Paul Gaultier; the himbo singer Nick Kamen, who got his break after Petri used him on the cover of The Face; the hip-hop star Neneh Cherry; and a sweet-tempered teenager named Naomi Campbell, who occasionally helped out at Petri's wardrobe sales, where he famously parted with Mugler jackets and other odds and ends for five pounds apiece.As fashion stylists started to become celebrities in their own right, Petri gathered his followers under the umbrella of Buffalo, his visual imaging company. He borrowed the name from Jacques Negrit, the bouncer at Les Bains Douches nightclub in Paris, whose private security business was staffed by large men from Guadeloupe who wore Air Force MA-1 jackets with ''Buffalo'' written on them. It was also an allusion to ''Buffalo Soldier,'' the Bob Marley song about black infantrymen who fought in the United States Army against Native Americans. Petri's posse wore cobalt-blue Buffalo jackets, and soon that word became shorthand for their universe. Neneh Cherry cemented the phenomenon with ''Buffalo Stance,'' her 1988 hit.''The song is about our gang, our time and our mentor, Ray, who is still behind every word and every melody,'' says Cherry, who met Petri en route to Tokyo, where he was producing a fashion show using eccentric London kids as models. ''Buffalo meant classic. None of us were into here-today-gone-tomorrow fashion, which is why we gravitated toward each other. Ray was always consistent, and he taught us that we shouldn't be afraid to be honest.''Just as Petri was poised to receive the mainstream recognition and financial success that many who followed in his footsteps enjoyed, he became sick with AIDS. ''He was one of the first well-known personalities in London to get the disease, and at the time not everyone knew how to react,'' says the milliner Stephen Jones. ''Sometimes people would move away from him at fashion shows, or they wouldn't invite him at all.'' A notable exception was Gaultier, who held a front-row seat for Petri until his death, in 1989. ''I was actually criticized for that by people working in the business, which made me very upset,'' Gaultier says. ''I felt that it was extremely courageous of Ray to expose himself. It was a show of strength, which I admired and had to support. But others refused to see the truth.''How would Petri feel about his posthumous vindication? ''I often think of what it would be like to have him around now,'' Mondino says. ''Ray died just as fashion was becoming more commercial, but I don't think that he would have approached things any differently than he always did. Most of his friends have made some money over the years, but to tell you the truth, we get a little bored a lot of the time.''</text></article><article id="1831956"><summary>Profile of British film actor Matthew Goode; photo (M)</summary><text>Despite idolizing Dapper Dans like Richard Burton and David Niven while growing up, Matthew Goode considers himself a jeans-and-T-shirt type of bloke: ''I like minimum fuss -- elegantly disheveled.''

The film, called ''Amores Perros,'' which translates, roughly, as ''love that is like a dog,'' was directed by a former D.J. named Alejandro Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu. Like Cuar&#243;n, del Toro, a director of elegant, almost religious horror films, was dazzled by the movie. It was much too long, but its intertwined trio of stories, all tales of love and redemption, had ambition and weight: the film aimed to be no less than a fresco of Mexico City, with all its chaos and violence and beauty. ''I did not know Guillermo,'' I&#241;&#225;rritu recalled recently, still amused by the memory. ''When he showed up at my door, he said, 'I am in love with your movie. I'll sleep on your couch and we can fix ''Amores Perros'' in four or five days.' ''With the editing of those three interlocking stories, another sort of triptych was born: the lasting friendship, both professional and personal, of Cuar&#243;n, del Toro and I&#241;&#225;rritu. In 2006, the trio created three of the most thrilling films of the year. ''Babel,'' which traces the global ramifications of a stray bullet, was directed by I&#241;&#225;rritu; ''Pan's Labyrinth,'' a kind of Catholic fairy tale set against the Spanish Civil War, was directed by del Toro; and ''Children of Men,'' a dystopian view of a world without youth, was directed by Cuar&#243;n. The films are wildly different, but they are linked by a common element: horrific violence matched with heartbreaking courage and compassion. Collectively, their movies are big, in the old-fashioned American filmmaking sense of creating an entire world on the screen, and yet small, in the foreign film sense of delineating complicated relationships and shifting moods.Two days after ''Babel'' won the Golden Globe for best dramatic film of the year, I&#241;&#225;rritu (pronounced in-NYAR-i-too) sat over a plate of sushi in Los Angeles and said of the film, also told with interwoven stories: ''It is a child with four heads. It's a big monster with one heart and one penis, which is a problem.'' I&#241;&#225;rritu, who is 43, laughed. He was wearing faded jeans and a white shirt, and, unlike most American directors, he does not seem boyish. ''Actually, there may be more than one penis: Alfonso and Guillermo were always there for me.''When ''Babel'' won the Globe, del Toro, whose ''Pan's Labyrinth'' was nominated for best foreign film, jumped out of his seat. ''I feel that it is a victory for all of us,'' del Toro told me later. ''We are, always, sincerely brutal about each other's work, but, above everything, we are friends.'' It's a distinctly Mexican bond: they no longer live in Mexico City, but their roots are there. ''It is a city that is like a civil war,'' I&#241;&#225;rritu explained. ''There is great beauty, but it is also a constant battleground. If you look at our movies, they all have that quality. Good and bad merge and, usually, good will win. . . .'' I&#241;&#225;rritu paused. ''We are Catholic, after all.''From the perspective of themes and plots, their shared religiosity is fascinating. While most American films are content to examine simple, narcissistic matters of romance or family, these three directors consistently tackle more existential questions of sin and forgiveness. Their scope is positively biblical: in ''Children of Men,'' Cuar&#243;n deftly depicts a not-too-distant future in which the imminent birth of the first infant in 18 years -- a kind of female Jesus -- might save the world. With ''Babel,'' I&#241;&#225;rritu is suggesting a similar unification, through the rather Catholic-like power of shared pain and the need to transcend that pain through love and understanding. Del Toro, too, views his 12-year-old protagonist as a saint. Her trials are violent, terrifying and highly symbolic. ''They all traffic in poetic reality,'' said the ''Babel'' co-star Cate Blanchett last May in Cannes, where I&#241;&#225;rritu won the prize for best director.''There's no question that this movie was my reaction to the war in Iraq,'' I&#241;&#225;rritu explained. ''This war cannot help but impregnate you with strong feelings. There was so much fear after 9/11, and that fear caused people to make the wrong decisions. People are dying by the thousands, and the American TV does not want to show the photographs, so I have to show it in my own way. Americans easily forget that the air they breathe is the same as those in Europe or Africa or Asia; it's the same air as Jesus breathed. I would like them to remember that connection.''When I&#241;&#225;rritu completed ''Babel,'' he showed a much lengthier cut to del Toro, who suggested the final edit. Similarly, when del Toro had difficulty with financing on ''Pan's Labyrinth,'' he turned to Cuar&#243;n, who had just directed ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' an enormous hit. Not since the heyday of the 1970s auteur, when Spielberg, Scorsese and Coppola supported and challenged one another, have a group of directors been this talented and this close.''It is interesting,'' I&#241;&#225;rritu said. ''Lately, foreign directors are better at making movies about America than Americans. Sometimes it is easier to see clearly when you have some distance. And nothing gives you perspective on America like being from Mexico.''Alejandro Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu: ''Good directors don't answer questions with their work,'' says Alejandro Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu, who clearly thrives on piquing people's curiosity. ''They generate debate and create discussion.'' He is eager to argue, for example, that the American public's growing interest in Mexican and foreign movies stands in sharp contrast to the government's increasing isolationism: ''Hollywood wants to open borders, and the President wants to close them.'' Although he has built an impressive career exploring the idea that our actions are chaotically interconnected in ways that we cannot foresee, he is open to the seemingly banal. ''I've never done a period piece or a comedy, and that could be something truly different for me,'' he says. ''In fact, I've never even made a movie that's told in a linear way. For most people that is the standard, but for me it would be like being on Mars.'' He wears a Giorgio Armani gray silk-and-cotton shirt.Guillermo del Toro: ''I have witnessed an inordinate amount of violence in my life,'' says Guillermo del Toro, as explanation for the fantastically eerie creatures that populate his films. No wonder: he grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico, a notorious epicenter of drug-related conflict. As a teenager, del Toro volunteered at a mental hospital located next to a morgue, where he saw everything from stabbings and gunshot wounds to decapitations; then, 10 years ago, his father was kidnapped and held hostage for more than two months. Add to that an extremely strict religious upbringing (he compares his grandmother to Piper Laurie's character in ''Carrie''), and the full picture comes into focus. ''I consider myself a lapsed Catholic,'' he says. ''But I try to take all that's beautiful about religion -- free will, virtue, nobility -- and apply it to life. Ultimately, my films are about characters trying to access some kind of spiritual realm on earth.'' Del Toro is in a Dolce &amp; Gabbana black cotton trench coat. Polo by Ralph Lauren black cotton polo shirt.Alfonso Cuar&#243;n: Growing up, Alfonso Cuar&#243;n never lacked for excitement. ''My biggest source of inspiration was my uncle Alfonso Quiroz Cuar&#243;n, a world-known criminologist,'' he says. ''He found Trotsky's assassin, introduced me to people like Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez and constantly advised me to work with topics that were personal, framing them in a sociopolitical context.'' Although he died long ago, Cuar&#243;n's uncle continues to exert an influence over him. ''I've always wanted to make a movie about a trip he and I took to Europe in the mid-'70s,'' Cuar&#243;n says. ''I lost my passport and had to cross the frontier between Austria and Germany illegally, with the help of a few Mormon tourists. Then I was mistaken for a Baader-Meinhof terrorist and arrested by the German police. When they realized who my uncle was, they let me go.'' Sounds like your typical family dramedy.

''It's not very fun,'' Dalhausser says. ''But in beach lingo, you get your 'sand legs.' '' Those legs -- not to mention a 6-foot-9, 200-pound frame -- helped Dalhausser achieve a fine 2006 season, earning him a second tour award for best offensive player. His high metabolism also affords him off-season treats from In-N-Out Burger. ''I can eat and eat and eat,'' says the player, who can lose 10 pounds in a single tournament. Spike itPAUL L.

That's because American artisans are no longer hiding the salumi -- Italian for cured meats. The process by which cuts of meat, usually pork, are salted and aged in a place that's cool, dark and drafty, like a mountain cave (the traditional method) or a well-ventilated meat locker (the Food and Drug Administration's preference), is now being mastered on these shores.The only way to enjoy salumi is when it's sliced paper-thin, preferably just before eating. But try using a knife on a salame (plural: salami) and you're putting your knuckles at serious risk. Ergo a deli-style slicer like the Chef's Choice VariTilt 632, available by Internet order at Williams-Sonoma ($280; www.williams-sonoma.com).It cuts thinly and evenly every time, and the rakishly tilted blade allows your slices to fall nicely onto a waiting platter. Best of all, you can stock your fridge with slabs of meat that will never make it to supermarket, like coppa from Salumi Artisan Cured Meats in Seattle or lardo from Taverna Santi in Geyserville, Calif. They can turn a snack into a sumptuous spread in less than five minutes. Just watch your fingers.Bresaola Bresaola is a lean cut of beef that's been salted and air-dried. The Fatted Calf in Berkeley, Calif., takes grass-fed eye round from Marin Sun Farms, cures it with sea salt and spices for two weeks, then slathers it with a funky coat of red wine and garlic paste and lets it hang for another eight weeks. $35 per pound; go to www.fattedcalf.com.Coppa It's like prosciutto, except that it's made from pork shoulder and neck; when sliced, it's a delicious swirl of fat and rosy meat. The coppa from Salumi Artisan Cured Meats is salted and sprinkled with sugar and pepper flakes, then aged for 10 weeks. $16 per pound; go to www.salumicuredmeats.com.Lardo Sometimes euphemistically called ''white prosciutto,'' lardo is pork back fat that's been salted and aged. It's advanced salumi, and nearly impossible to find. But the executive chef Dino Bugica of Taverna Santi makes it with an intensely flavorful rub of ground allspice, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, peppercorns and star anise. A half-pound piece of lardo is $7; go to www.tavernasanti.com.Mortadella Mortadella isn't salumi -- it's cooked, not cured -- but it's one of the all-stars of Italian sausage.Fra' Mani, Paul Bertolli's salumeria in Berkeley, just started making a mortadella with finely chopped (instead of pur&#233;ed) Niman Ranch pork; like the real stuff from Bologna, it dissolves in your mouth. Just don't call it baloney. Available this spring; go to www.framani.com for information.Prosciutto A ham hind leg that's been boned, salted, air-dried and traditionally aged for at least eight months, prosciutto is the big game of salumi. Most prosciutto is crudo, which means salted when raw and then aged. The prosciutto from Benton's Country Hams in Madisonville, Tenn., is made with Berkshire pork and aged for 15 months; there's sugar in the cure, and the unorthodox depth makes it a favorite at pork-obsessed restaurants like Manhattan's Momofuku. Deep in the heart of Iowa's pig country, La Quercia makes a pure prosciutto with heirloom breeds. Rarer still is prosciutto cotto, where the leg is cured and then cooked. You can find it at Col. Bill Newsom's Aged Kentucky Country Hams in Princeton, Ky., and as the centerpiece of the artisanal ham tasting at Manhattan's Bar Americain.Salame and Soppressata Salame is cured sausage; gourmet stores sometimes use ''salame'' and ''soppressata'' interchangeably, though soppressata is a kind of salame often made with cuts from the head of the pig. Salame is produced in New York by such institutions as G. Esposito &amp; Sons Pork Store in Brooklyn and Calabria Pork Store in the Bronx, but a delicious newcomer, the salame Toscano from Fra' Mani, is cured with garlic, red wine and sea salt, and it tastes like the Tuscan -- or Berkeley -- hills. $175 for seven pounds, including shipping; go to www.framani.com.Speck Made from the same cut of the leg as prosciutto, speck is smoked before being salted and aged, an extra step that reflects its Dolomite origin and Austrian influences. The buttery speck from La Quercia is aged up to 10 months, about twice as long as most speck, and then cold-smoked with applewood. $24 per pound; go to www.laquercia.us.Roasted New Potatoes and Tomatoes With LardoSalumi isn't just for sandwiches: Dino Bugica, the executive chef at Taverna Santi in Geyserville, Calif., layers lardo over roasted potatoes and cherry tomatoes for a simple yet rich side dish. Serves 412 fingerling or other new potatoesOlive oilSalt and pepper1 sprig rosemary24 cherry tomatoes8 slices lardo.1. Toss the potatoes with olive oil and a light seasoning of salt and pepper, and roast in a 375-degree oven for about 35 minutes. Add rosemary; roast for another 5 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes more, until the skins on the tomatoes begin to split and the potatoes are tender when pricked with a knife.2. Transfer to a serving dish; just before bringing to the table, layer the lardo on top.The Mantry</text></article><article id="1831966"><summary>Yelo is sleep spa on West 57th Street where members can catch 20- to 40-minute naps in atmosphere designed to ensure relaxation; photo (S)</summary><text>Somewhere between a power nap and a disco nap lies Yelo. The new sleep spot on West 57th Street is getting New Yorkers to take a load off -- in the purely holistic sense. Drop into the futuristic space with or without an appointment (a monitor in the window alerts passers-by to the next available opening, also visible at www.heloyelo.com) and settle into a YeloCab, a patented, high-tech honeycomb where everything from the chair to the temperature (and the Nepalese cashmere blanket) is calibrated to lull you to sleep for 20 to 40 minutes -- all you need to boost your productivity and alertness, according to Nicolas Ronco, Yelo's founder. Ronco, a 39-year-old former business-development executive, admired during trips to Asia how his Eastern colleagues handled stress by taking quick naps during the day. Experiencing reflexology and sleep therapy in Japan and volunteering on an ashram in India taught him the power of calm in the midst of a metropolis. But there's nothing New Age about the space, which is gender-neutral right down to the hard-to-find products it sells. ''We have guys who are embarrassed to come in here,'' Ronco says, ''but then they buy memberships and stop in before meetings or dinners. It's better than going home.'' An annual membership costs $100 to $500.CHRISTINE MUHLKE</text></article><article id="1831967"><summary>Chandler Burr reviews three men's fragrances: Osmanthe Yunnan from Hermes, Sunset Heat for Men from Escada and Chrome from Azzaro; photo (M)</summary><text>Osmanthe Yunnan smells like a field of hay: you inhale summer sunlight, perhaps some dry straw, clover and honey. It also smells (and there's no other way to describe it) bizarrely more human than that -- as if these earthly delights had been caught on the sweaty skin of the young man harvesting that field. Jean-Claude Ellena, the Herm&#232;s perfumer, has taken this complex tonality and built out of it a scent the way a master carpenter turns raw oak into a perfect, linear, quietly masculine chest of drawers. The experience of smelling it is like that of listening to an orchestra tuning up: dozens of instruments intent on finding their own perfect balance, a scattering of notes, and then the composer taps the podium.The name Sunset Heat for Men is alarming, but nowhere near as alarming as the scent itself. You smell it and -- instantly -- the question: what was Escada thinking? Like many fragrances that are cheap (both aesthetically and literally; I'm assuming the concentrate for this perfume costs what some companies pay to scent shampoos), this thing explodes out of the bottle like Jamba Juice. I like that. It appeals to my bad taste for neon fruits. But in three minutes the smoothie top burns out, and you smell the base, an acrid, stale clich&#233;, the scent of charred cedar wood in a tin can.To smell Azzaro's Chrome is to feel metal running through your veins instead of warm blood. An industry figure once told me that Chrome ''is nothing but CK One superconcentrated with a bit of synthetic marine note.'' The perfumer G&#233;rard Haury has engineered a clone warrior breathing nitrous oxide. Chrome smells like a sheet of aluminum on a frozen beach, a scent to be bought by a certain type of man for whom beauty and subtlety are Orwellian opposites. It is also a commercial smash. What does that say?Whiff Notes</text></article><article id="1831970"><summary>Bob Morris article on jewelry designed for men; photo (M)</summary><text>Devon Turnbull, a young designer who is part of a Manhattan fashion collective called Nom de Guerre, is not what you'd call a mama's boy -- but he does like wearing her pearls. A few years ago, when she gave them to him, he had all 109 restrung onto a gold-link chain that hangs below his waist, like something between a prayer shawl and an overextended rosary. He took up pearl wearing for complex spiritual reasons having to do with Transcendental Meditation and a system of Vedic astrology called Jyotish. ''But I also just always liked pearls,'' Turnbull says.At first his friends told him: ''Oh, come on, you're a straight guy. You can't go out wearing pearls like that.'' His simple response, ''Why not?''It would be hard to argue with that in this Beckhamesque moment of masculine adornment. Ever since the bling bang, a ''why not?'' kind of attitude has prevailed. All kinds of men -- from the designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce to the tennis player Marat Safin -- feel comfortable flaunting jewelry.Perhaps it's because the look has morphed into something much gentler than gangsta style, including an eclectic mix of tarnished pendants, historical icons, ethnic beads, Brazilian wish bracelets, red kabbalah strings, crystals, bones, rubber, leather, onyx and odd semiprecious stones -- in other words, anything and everything. One label, Rust, makes leather necklaces with silver charms inspired by Neolithic tools. Another, Black Sheep and Prodigal Son, has scrimshaw-like cameos from piano keys on men's stickpins. Gia Unearthen fuses stones like blue tourmaline and clear quartz with discarded bullet casings. And in Paris, while Ann Demeulemeester was sending male models in pearls down her runway, Ren&#233; Talmon l'Arm&#233;e was selling black Tahitian pearls for men, attached to silver skulls on rough-hewn silver chains.''It's all about originality and handcrafting,'' says Evan Yurman, 25, who designs men's jewelry for his father, David Yurman. A few years ago, the only men's jewelry the company offered were classic gift pieces. Now the line has expanded to include leather bracelets, black onyx dog tags and rugged box-chain necklaces with crosses and Stars of David. ''I like things that make you think about culture and history,'' says Yurman, who freely mixes religious iconography around his own neck.Mary Jo Pane is into the religious, too. She started Miracle Icons six years ago as a way of tapping into her Catholicism and what she calls the culture of spiritual evolution. ''It began as a woman's business, but now it's 75 percent men,'' Pane says of her line of vintage pendants and charms that hang three to an oxidized silver chain. Her clients include Johnny Depp, Jake Gyllenhaal and Matthew McConaughey. ''It's not about shiny things,'' Pane adds. ''It's about wearing things that are personal.''Italo Zucchelli, the creative director of men's wear at Calvin Klein, who often wears a ring inscribed with poetry and a crystal on his neck from an important old friend, says, ''It's about wearing something with meaning.'' But then, doesn't every piece of jewelry -- from yellow rubber and red string bracelets to gaudy signet rings inherited from illustrious ancestors -- have a story?Pre-Diddy, women had the accessories that did most of the talking. Men who wanted to impress were stuck with Rolex watches and Tiffany cuff links. Then, suddenly, every male with authority issues (in other words, most) was piercing and tattooing, showing a primordial and tribal male urge for meaningful adornment. Ironically, though, it's women who remain skeptical about men in jewelry. They think it shows an untrustworthy amount of vanity. Women, not men, they insist, are supposed to do all the jingling and jangling.''It really depends on the man,'' says Donna Karan. ''If it's in character, jewelry can look great. But if a guy doesn't know how to wear it, it can look pretty stupid.'' Indeed, Details magazine recently stuck it to Colin Farrell, Wilmer Valderrama and Jeremy Piven, among others, suggesting that they shift focus from accessorizing to acting.Still, Kassandra Lao, a young designer who's been living with Devon Turnbull for several years, has never had a problem with pearls. ''It's who he is,'' she said the other night while they were shopping together in a Whole Foods in Midtown Manhattan. He does, she added somewhat sheepishly, wear them inside his shirt.As they walked the aisles, a sweet young couple in love, there was a gentle clinking beneath Turnbull's parka. ''What kind of vegetables do you want for dinner?'' he asked. ''Butternut squash or carrots?''How about those pearl onions?</text></article><article id="1831971"><summary>Photos of men's beach wear and accessories</summary><text>1.

Eventually this led the company to hire the graffiti artist Futura, who designed a limited edition of the Dunk basketball sneaker that Nike made in the 1980s. The sneaker was sold through skateboard stores, and sneakerheads snapped it up. Like art museums, sports companies have found that the best way to tap into the coveted youth market is to bring outsider artists in.America has become like a giant playing field. We dress in neoprene and Lycra, tattoo our bodies in ways that mimic the logos on athletes' uniforms, and collect sneakers as if they're Ryan McGinley photographs. They're sometimes worth nearly as much.We consume reality shows rooted in the old Roman gladiatorial games, and our political leaders hawk war to us on television the way Vince Lombardi psyched up his Green Bay Packers, saying that winning isn't everything, it's the only thing (except, as true athletes know, for losing).Meanwhile, late modernism's cult of the gym-toned body has elevated narcissism to the level of religion, extreme sports being our equivalent of what flagellants did in the Middle Ages. Skiers schussing down Everest or climbers clawing up K2 seek what Kant called ''the terrifying sublime'' by filtering natural beauty through death-defying stunts. When a society like ours, inured to traditional forms of beauty, comes to equate shock with awe, the true sublime gives way to its glitzier simulacra. Which is pretty much what the photographer Andreas Gursky provided us not long ago when he shot a soccer match in Amsterdam from an improbable eagle's-eye perch above the stadium. The glamour of his panoramic picture is derived from the prowess in accomplishing it.For contemporary artists, and for fashion designers, too, sports have become a metaphorical gold mine. As a meditation on disenfranchisement and loss, the Australian artist Tracey Moffat shot a memorable series of pictures at the 2000 Olympics of fourth-place Olympians, the ones who just missed getting a medal. Collier Schorr photographed high school wrestlers as a measure of masculine identity and a window onto teenage subcultures. Wrestling is brutal and also touching, Schorr said, so she suspected that ''a lot of people see their own struggles as teenagers in the pictures.''Art has always trafficked in sporting symbols, of course, beginning with the art of the ancient Assyrians, who carved hunting scenes into stone as emblems of their imperial ferocity. A long history of art in China and India includes countless scenes of Mughal emperors hunting animals like antelopes and tigers. In Western art, the virgin huntress Diana, when spied in the nude by Actaeon, turned him into a stag, after which his own hounds devoured him. (No wonder Freud loved ancient myths.) In Titian's hands, Diana, protectress of pubescent girls, became a sporty archer in tie-up sandals and bracelets, hair gathered in a loose bun, a silky tunic gaping to reveal one breast, shooting an arrow at her hunky voyeur, who has newly furry ears and a shiny nose, dogs nipping at his crotch.The connection between art and sport has depended on a mutual infatuation with physical perfection, which translates easily into sex and power. In Leni Riefenstahl's orgiastic paean to Hitler's 1936 Olympics, the camera ogles naked, beaming, German swimmers giving each other rubdowns in the sauna, then leaping off the high board, doing pirouettes and swan dives (it's raining men!), more and more of them presented in erotically slow motion from above, below and underwater, plunging into the pool, then leaping back out of it, in and out. (Riefenstahl included backward shots to heighten the cinematography's kinetic abstraction.) It's so seductive that you might almost overlook the inconvenience of the fact that these beautiful people were Nazi ideals, as Dolce &amp; Gabbana perhaps unconsciously did in last year's bizarre replay of Riefenstahl's Aryan men, dressing the models in tank tops and shorts.But then, art has never necessarily been moral, which is why Riefenstahl's boss, one of the most aesthetic of tyrants, negotiated to buy from Italy the most famous work of sporting art in Western history, the divine Discobolus by Myron -- a sculpture of a discus thrower, arm raised, knees flexed, torso bursting with muscles, the epitome of grace and anticipatory release, and the culmination of all that sexy Greek art about athletes. ''Noble simplicity and quiet grandeur,'' as the historian Winckelmann put it. For Hitler, this meant Teutonic, and it became Riefenstahl's model.Notwithstanding her Nazi links, she established the visual template for later artists. You might even say that much of the performance movement of the late 1960s and '70s defined itself in relation to her. When a skinny Bruce Nauman in a white T-shirt filmed himself falling backward into the corner of a room, then pushing himself upright, then falling back again, he was echoing, consciously or otherwise, Riefenstahl's use of repeated movements, her disorienting camera angles with their resulting abstraction. Her heroics became his version of a Beckett play, sport as nihilism, and in the process, Nauman established a whole new image of athletic cool.Leap forward to Jeff Koons's 1980s basketball (the Julius Erving model) immaculately suspended in a tank of water, like Dr. J himself hanging in midair before a dunk. It served as an affectless sign of capitalist excess, with a nod to Minimalist form. Gary Simmons then paid Koons homage by arranging pairs of gold-painted sneakers as if in a police lineup, using sports to riff on crime and race. After which David Hammons, the bricolagist, fashioned a crude backboard out of a window frame fringed by ruffles of rubber tire, turning Koons's device into a symbol of broken ghetto dreams.But no artist has absorbed sports more thoroughly into his work than Matthew Barney, the former J. Crew model and high school quarterback turned cryptic filmmaker and self-mythologist, whose looks come straight out of Riefenstahl. Barney's work, building on Nauman's and on other '70s video and performance artists', is partly about acting as a kind of model, a symbol (he talks about letting the body be ''a tool'') in scenarios that entail athletic feats -- climbing an elevator shaft, leaping off a 40-foot pier or off a bridge with a bungee cord, straining at the end of a tether and trying to make marks with a piece of chalk on paper affixed to a wall. Call it extreme sports art.Barney is operating at the limits of coherence and endurance -- both his limits and ours. He likes the analogy of muscle being built up through exercises that break down tissue. Art, like sports, requires effort, risk and resistance. In a sense, he's asking his audience to take a leap, too. It's the perfect sports metaphor.</text></article><article id="1831974"><summary>Photos of peacenik-inspired men's fashions</summary><text>Observe the species at play, dressed for his unnatural habitat in rich, neo-peacenik threads.</text></article><article id="1831975"><summary>Interview with Richard Gere, who comments on his latest movie, The Hoax; photos (M)</summary><text>In your new film ''The Hoax'' (due out April 6), you play Clifford Irving, the notorious writer who forged an autobiography of Howard Hughes in 1971. Irving was remarkably convincing. Until Hughes came out of seclusion to reveal that the book was a fake, the publishing world completely embraced him.The story of Clifford Irving and his Hughes biography shows that people will believe what they want to believe. When I first read the script, I wasn't sure I was right for the part, but then I started doing research on Clifford. He had a bit of that frat-boy thing. Clifford liked the idea of putting something over on these big authority figures who ran publishing and the media. I think he believed that he would tell the public about the hoax later. But it got out of hand. When you look at the material that he faked, it is shocking that anyone believed him. The forgeries of Howard's signature are so bad -- a 12-year-old would have done it better. But that underscores one of the main themes of the film, which is the gullibility of people that want to believe. It's human nature: we want to believe our children, our families, our President.In spite of his perpetrating this enormous fraud, you seem to like Irving. Do you have to like the characters you play?I did like him -- there is genuine creativity in his book on Hughes. Ultimately, you have to like the characters you play. A performance is not credible unless you have affection for their personality.In the film, Irving is always working an angle. He's different from the smooth characters, like Julian in ''American Gigolo,'' that made you a sex symbol.Well, it was not my goal to become a sex symbol. [He shrugs.] If you walk out in the rain, you'll get wet. As a young actor, I was lucky. I was not even the first choice for ''American Gigolo.''It was to star John Travolta.That's right. And they had made all the suits and shirts for Travolta. I am a very different type, and Ferdinando Scarfiotti, who designed the movie, took one look at me in Travolta's suits and said, ''You look like a clown.'' He started from scratch and remade the wardrobe. I had only two weeks to prepare for that film. I didn't know anything about clothes, and that was a key element of the character. The clothes could not seem like costumes; they had to be believable. I also had to develop a way of walking: that guy had to have a walk.Nina Van Pallandt, who played your madam in ''American Gigolo,'' had been one of Clifford Irving's girlfriends. Did you ever discuss him while you were making that movie?I tried, but she did not want to talk about him. I liked her. Very sexy. It's strange: I've come across a lot of people who knew Clifford. He was quite a ladies' man. I was getting a massage from my longtime masseuse, and she asked me what I was working on. She never talks, but when I told her I was playing Clifford Irving, she abruptly stopped kneading my back. It turns out that he had tried to pick her up on the Hamptons jitney and, even though he was married, they stayed friends. Clifford just kept the table going.''The Hoax'' is set in the 1970s. That was when you moved to Manhattan. What was the city like then?I first came here when I was a teenager. I grew up in a small town in New York, and I was anxious for my life to get started. The theater held enormous interest for me, so for three days or so I left home and ran away to New York City. That was the late '60s. It was a great time: on Bleecker Street, I saw ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' with Jason Robards, and across the street, at the Bleecker Street Cinema, I watched a double bill of Warhol films. I stayed with people I met in the park. I don't think that could happen now.What was the first movie you remember?I remember watching Italian muscleman movies on Saturday-afternoon TV with characters like Hercules, Samson and Ulysses. As a kid, I liked those archetypal, heroic, muscular guys. Big, silent men. I still like those epic dramas: I'm thinking of doing a western.In your 20s, you seemed to gravitate toward the stage rather than film.That's where the work was. But, after a while, I didn't really like being on the stage. Repetition does not appeal to me. It felt like a civil service job. Theater just didn't scare me enough.Film -- the demands of having a camera in your face -- was more terrifying. My 20s were difficult. I think that those are hard years for most men. Older men want to kill you, and girls don't really want you. They're most interested in the rich, older guy. For me, money was scarce, and I was extremely lonely. But New York was such an exciting place then that it compensated for all my insecurities.Unlike most actors, you have taken on challenges as you've gotten older. For instance, in ''Chicago,'' you sang and danced.The tap dancing in that film nearly killed me. I had no idea it would be so hard. I was nervous about that movie. For me, every film has to have an emotional center, a kind of dreamlike reality. Dreams are very real when you are in them, whether you're tap-dancing in ''Chicago'' or playing Clifford Irving, who clearly began to believe that he had a real connection with Howard Hughes. It was probably devastating for Clifford when Hughes disowned him. A dream, no matter how absurd, can be vivid and completely alive. That's what I look for in movies: an idea fueled by complicated emotions.Correction:  March 18, 2007, Sunday  A picture caption with an article last Sunday in T: Men's Fashion magazine, about the actor Richard Gere, carried an incorrect identification from Everett Collection, a photography archive, for the actress shown with Mr. Gere in a scene from the film ''The Hoax.''

In the 1920s, the Duke of Windsor asked Pringle for a special sweater to go with his argyle socks; inspiration ensued, and traditional plaid had a rival.Until Charles Macintosh combined dissolved rubber with two pieces of wool in 1823, waterproofing did not exist.

Designed by Ray-Ban for the Air Force in 1936, these metal-framed specs were eventually hijacked by the fashion and music sets.With suspenders figuring large in the spring wardrobe, it's interesting to note who received the first American patent for them: Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, in 1871.Before 1896, men's shirt collars flew about willy-nilly.

When I entered the garden, I felt surprise because I never thought that I could walk in a place like that in the United States. I almost forgot I was in America. I felt like I went back to Asia. After we passed the pond, it rained, so my friends and I went to a garden house to seek shelter. We sat and talked about the beautiful view in the garden. I think it was interesting, because we stayed in a Japanese-style garden, talked about it in Chinese, and we were in United States. The different countries' elements were assembled at that moment.''As told to J. R. Romanko</text></article><article id="1832026"><summary>Chris Dixon travel article on 36-hour visit to Charleston, SC; photos; maps (M)</summary><text>CHARLESTON became a new city in 2005. Once choked off from its northern suburbs by a pair of dangerously obsolete trussed spans, residents can now zip over the Cooper River along the new Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge -- a 3.5-mile-long, eight-lane wonder. More than a traffic shortcut, the Ravenel Bridge has fundamentally altered Charleston's psychology. Nowhere is this more true than on the bridge's wide bike-and-pedestrian lane. Suburban moms from Mount Pleasant rub elbows with families from gritty downtown Charleston. And Lycra-wearing cyclists whiz past iPod-clutching joggers from the bustling Citadel and College of Charleston. It's a perfect symbol for Charleston, straddling the Old and New South.Friday3 p.m.  1. In the Garden of Good  While Charleston cannot boast as many oak-ringed parks as Savannah, the four-block Gateway Walk is just as beautiful, with a series of interconnected and semihidden gardens. The walk is lined with moss-laden oaks and takes you past the city's most historically significant churches. Among them are St. John's Lutheran Church (5 Clifford Street, 843-723-2426; www.stjohnscharleston.org), whose building goes back to 1817, and St. Philip's Church (142 Church Street, 843-722-7734; www.stphilipschurchsc.org) whose steeple was once used as a lighthouse.4 p.m.  2. Meet at Market  The intersection of Meeting and Market Streets is dominated by Market Hall, a Greek Revival temple built in 1841 that houses a vibrant open-air mall. The northern end has a number of small, enclosed shops that sell hats, jewelry and Christmas ornaments, while the southern end is filled with jewelers, antiques dealers, painters, potters and weavers who make sweetgrass baskets -- an African-American art form that was recently named the state's official handicraft. Noteworthy vendors include Turtle Creek (843-884-7521; www.puzzleboxguy.com), which sells hand-carved puzzle boxes made of cedar, walnut and canarywood (from about $20), and Else Olsen, who sells handmade jade and tiger eye necklaces ($25 to $45).7 p.m.  3. Find Your Inner Snob  Good food is a big deal in Charleston, and East Bay Street has a glut of exceptional restaurants. Grill 225, Cypress, High Cotton and Magnolias have all garnered accolades, but the spotlight this year is on Slightly North of Broad, better known by its acronym SNOB (192 East Bay Street, 843-723-3424; www.mavericksouthernkitchens.com). The restaurant may be less formal and more intimate than its neighbors, but what sets SNOB apart are fresh ingredients, largely supplied by organic farmers on nearby Wadmalaw Island. Try the local shrimp and grits, made from heirloom corn grown and milled nearby ($14.50). Expect local peach cobbler and peach sangria soon.9 p.m.  4. Pie, Cake or Wine  Stroll along picturesque Market Street and end up at Kaminsky's Most Excellent Caf&#233; (78 North Market Street, 843-853-8270; www.tbonz.com/kam.asp), a boisterous spot for sweets like Toll House cookie pie ($3.95 a slice). For a quieter setting, head farther north to the City Lights coffee shop (141 Market Street, 843-853-7067). It's an intimate spot to unwind with a glass of wine or delicious carrot cake ($4.95).Saturday9 a.m.  5. Proposing a Toast  Tropical Toast at Diana's (155 Meeting Street, 843-534-0043; www.tropicaltoast.com) looks fairly plain on the outside, but inside, you'll find a cozy place decorated like a Jimmy Buffett song with a thatch hut bar and palm tree motifs. The breakfasts include currant French toast stuffed with apples or peaches ($7.50 single, $9.79 double), and Eggs Meeting Street ($11.99) -- a stack of poached eggs, fried green tomatoes, crab cakes and r&#233;moulade.10:30 a.m.  6. Cousin Arthur  Named after its dogged champion, a former state senator affectionately known as ''Cousin'' Arthur Ravenel, the $632 million bridge is a graceful, arching ribbon supported by a pair of 572-foot-tall towers laced with 128 suspension cables. But its beauty belies its strength. The bridge was designed to withstand a 7.3 Richter scale earthquake (like the one that nearly leveled the city in 1886). The real winner is the greenway, popular with bicyclists and joggers. Bike the Bridge Rentals (360 Concord Street, 843-853-2453; www.bikethebridgerentals.com) rents bicycles starting at $15 for three hours.Noon  7. Why It's Called Pleasant  Explore the historic village of Mount Pleasant, settled by colonists in the late 1600s, a mossy and oak-shrouded community that is among the prettiest in the Lowcountry. Historical highlights include the Mount Pleasant Presbyterian Church (302 Hibben Street, 843-884-4612; www.mppc.net), which once housed a school for freed slaves, and the Pitt Street Pharmacy (111 Pitt Street, 843-884-4051; www.pittstreetpharmacy.com), which dates back to 1938. Order a cherry Coke float from the old soda fountain ($3.25). Or hop across the Sullivan's Island Causeway for Poe's Tavern (2210 Middle Street, 843-883-0083), a popular lunch spot in an old beach house. Try the spicy yellowfin tuna tacos with pineapple relish ($10.75).3 p.m.  8. Gullah Tour  To learn about the culture of Lowcountry African-Americans, hop aboard the Gullah Tours (843-763-7551; www.gullahtours.com) led by Alphonso Brown, a lifelong resident who demonstrates his native Gullah tongue. Mr. Brown displays an encyclopedic knowledge of oft-overlooked sites like the Brown Fellowship Graveyard for Light Skinned Blacks (not to be confused with the Thomas Smalls Graveyard for the Society of Freed Blacks of Dark Complexion just next to it). The two-hour tour meets at Gallery Chuma Art Gallery (43 John Street) and cost $18.5 p.m.  9. Handbags and Other Pearls  King Street is the city's retail strip, and mixed among the Urban Outfitters and Quiksilvers are local treasures. The chic handbag maker Mary Norton has her flagship store, MooRoo, at No. 316 (843-724-1081; www.mooroo.com). Geo. C. Birlant &amp; Company (191 King Street, 843-722-3842; www.birlant.com) is among the largest of the area's antiques dealers. And Croghan's Jewel Box (308 King Street, 843-723-3594; www.croghansjewelbox.com), which has been in the same family for 92 years, carries an impressive collection of estate jewelry, including Tahitian and South Sea pearls.7 p.m.  10. Oak on the Menu  Bring your shopping bags to Coast (39-D John Street, 843-722-8838; www.coastbarandgrill.com), a casual, hip restaurant in a former indigo warehouse. It has open oak grills and tin-roofed booths that draw savvy locals. The menu, which specializes in local seafood, includes a tangy shellfish and watermelon ceviche ($12.95) and daily catches that are grilled and served with sauces like r&#233;moulade or pineapple-chili salsa ($18.50 to $19.95).9:30 p.m.  11. Old Town in New Light  For a scenic nightcap, head to the popular rooftop Pavilion Bar at the Market Pavilion Hotel (225 East Bay Street, 843-723-0500; www.marketpavilion.com). Order a Paviliontini, made with Absolut Citron, pineapple juices with a splash of orange juice ($7.50), and gaze out over the town's steeples and dark waters of Ashley River. To the north, the illuminated Ravenel Bridge rises above the U.S.S. Yorktown Museum.Sunday9:30 a.m.  12. Hearing Bells  Old Charleston is made for walking. Start your Sunday constitutional at St. Michael's Episcopal Church (71 Broad Street, 843-723-0603; www.stmichaelschurch.net) and hear the enormous bronze bells ring at 9:40 a.m. sharp. The surrounding streets are residential, and it's easy to imagine what life was like here 150 years ago.A walk along the waterfront will carry you past grand mansions to White Point Gardens (East Battery Street and Murray Boulevard). It was at this oak- and palmetto-lined sanctuary where townspeople watched the first shots fired on nearby Fort Sumter in 1861.1 p.m.  13. Among the Dolphins  Charleston may be among the country's oldest cities, but there is still plenty of wildlife nearby. If the sun is out, go sea kayaking along Folly and Sol Legare Creeks, home to more than 250 species of birds. The waters teem with Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, which exhibit a fascinating behavior known as strand feeding. Groups of dolphins run schools of shad and mullet out of the water and onto mud flats and then eat them. Coastal Expeditions (2223 Folly Road, 843-406-0640; www.coastalexpeditions.com) has three-hour trips for $58 a person.THE BASICSCharleston International Airport (www.chs-airport.com) is served by Delta, Continental, Northwest, US Airways, American Eagle and United Express. A rental car is recommended, but the Charleston Black Cab Company (843-216-2627, www.charlestonblackcabcompany.com) offers London-style taxis from the airport to downtown ($29 for one person, $40 for two or more).Charleston has plenty of impeccable hotels and bed-and-breakfasts. At the luxury end is the Market Pavilion Hotel (225 East Bay Street, 843-723-0500; www.marketpavilion.com), which has 66 opulent rooms with mahogany furniture and four-poster beds. Rooms average $350.For a quiet and romantic getaway, check into the Old Village Post House in Mount Pleasant (101 Pitt Street, 843-388-8935, www.mavericksouthernkitchens.com). This six-room 1888 inn features 10-foot-high ceilings and original hardwood floors. Rooms, all with private bath, are $115 to $195.The Holiday Inn Historic District (125 Calhoun Street, 843-805-7900, www.holidayinn.com ) is centrally located near Marion Square Park and shop-filled King Street, and has a stellar concierge. Rooms start at $159.  36 HOURS</text></article><article id="1832027"><summary>Richard Woodward travel article on shopping trip through 19th-century shopping arcades of Paris; photos; map (L)</summary><text>THE 19th-century shopping arcades of Paris, or passages couverts, are proof that anything modern, if spared the wrecking ball, can be stimulus for nostalgia. When these iron-columned, glass-covered structures shot up around the city in the 1820s and '30s, they were visionary pieces of industrial-age technology, as whoop-de-do in their day as the warped titanium of Frank Gehry is for ours.Diminutive cathedrals to commerce and leisure, the arcades offered unheard of amenities to the emerging class of bourgeois consumers. Gas lighting, heated shelter from rain and mud, a panoply of goods and services in a contained space, cafes and restaurants where you could rest and observe fellow lingerers -- these were a decided plus over the shopping experience of hunting and gathering all around town.The ''Illustrated Guide to Paris'' from 1852 neatly summarized the appeal: ''In speaking of the inner boulevards, we have made mention again and again of the arcades which open onto them. These arcades, a recent invention of industrial luxury, are glass-roofed, marble-paneled corridors extending through whole blocks of buildings, whose owners have joined together for such enterprises. Lining both sides of these corridors, which get their light from above, are the most elegant shops, so that the arcade is a city, a world in miniature, in which customers will find everything they need.''Their heyday was brief. Later trends in consumer architecture -- notably the mid-century department store, another Paris invention -- rendered these small-scale archetypes pass&#233;. This didn't prevent other countries from copying a proven model. Glass-enclosed, sunlit bazaars soon appeared around the world. Every suburban galleria where you amble among a warren of upscale stores protected from the elements can trace its ancestry to the Paris arcades.For a while the passages were frequented largely by architecture students and social historians curious to see where the shopping mall was born. But the city has in recent decades made an effort to commemorate their cultural importance (most have historical markers at their entrances) and to restore them as pleasure domes. Several have undergone thorough renovations and are again chic shopping destinations.Even if you buy nothing, the reverberant acoustics and filtered light in any arcade make a stroll-through a worthwhile excursion. Like the factory loft and the barge canal, they are sentimental ruins of the industrial past and, as such, full of atmosphere for the post-modern tourist.The Passage des Panoramas, off the boulevard Montmartre, is the place to start. Fewer than 20 of the 150 arcades built in the first half of the 19th century are still standing, and many of those that are, like this one, can be found in the Second Arrondissement. One of the oldest (the original version was built in 1800) and the first public place in Paris to have gas lighting (1817), it gets its name from the painted panoramas (one, an aerial view of Paris, the other, showing the evacuation of the English in 1793 from Toulon) that were once projected on twin rotundas inside the passage. When they were destroyed in 1831, the crowds dispersed. But with hangouts like Le Caf&#233; V&#233;ron, Marquis Chocolates and La P&#226;tisserie F&#233;lix, the arcade remained popular with fl&#226;neurs (a not entirely complimentary term loosely translated as layabout and voyeur) for decades. The architect Jean-Louis Victor Grisart added three additional passages in the 1830s, one of which, the Galerie des Vari&#233;t&#233;s, connected to the Th&#233;&#226;tre des Vari&#233;t&#233;s where in the 1860s many of Offenbach's operas were first performed. (Declared a historic monument in 1975, the theater was owned until a few years ago by Jean-Paul Belmondo.)Today, the labyrinth of quiet, sheltered pathways is struggling to keep up appearances. Stern, the venerable engraver and stationery store, has been here since 1834, while the Asian restaurants and office supply stores are, like much else, newer tenants. These arcades have long been a home for the philatelic trade, and many of the window displays in the tiny shops feature used stamps and postcards. (For 15 euros, or a little over $20, I bought some mid-20th-century views of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, the spiral-shaped manmade park beloved by the surrealists.)As you walk deeper into the intestines of the place and farther away from the boulevard, the number of empty storefronts increases. Attempts to revive the fortunes of this side of the street have been only partly successful, which makes its fragile existence more poignant.The Passage Jouffroy on the other side of boulevard Montmartre is much livelier and more uniformly prosperous. The first heated arcade and the first built entirely of iron and glass, it has suffered fewer ups and downs than its neighbor. Restored in 1987, it is packed with intriguing, high-end specialty shops. Women can browse Boutique des Tuniques, in business here since 1903, while men who aspire to be a boulevardier or country squire can visit M. G. W. Segas, famed for its selection of walking sticks, some going for as much as 1,500 euros ($2,010 at $1.34 to the euro).Farther in are two wonderlands for young children: Pain d'&#201;pices, with its handmade toys and dolls, and La Bo&#238;te &#224; Joujoux, sort of a Home Depot for miniaturists. It offers dozens of styles of Victorian dollhouses, and as many kinds of doors, windows, staircases, bookcases, even parquet. To ease life down the rabbit hole: a three-piece bathroom set (sink, tub, toilet) in blue china can be had for 11.90 euros.One of the best aspects of the Passage Jouffroy is that the restorers haven't embalmed it in good taste. Emptying into one end is an exit from the hokey Mus&#233;e Gr&#233;vin, with waxwork replicas of historic personages and celebrities (a recent one is the French-American basketball star Tony Parker) while at the other end is the H&#244;tel Chopin, with budget accommodations (single rooms start at 50 euros a night) in a funky setting. Cin&#233;doc, among the city's premier resources for film books, posters, stills and other cinema memorabilia, is also a reason for a visit.Several blocks to the east, at 23, rue St.-Augustin, the Passage Choiseul could benefit from some tidying up. Louis-Ferdinand C&#233;line, whose mother had a successful lace shop here in the 1910s, wrote loathing descriptions of the place (''the most worst of all'') in his novels. If largely devoid of the charm to be found in other arcades, this one at least is a vital place of business for its customers. Largely run by and for immigrants, it has the noisy air of an oriental souk, another prototype for the covered markets that no doubt guided 19th-century Parisian architects.The exquisitely restored Galerie Vivienne, on the other hand, is so immaculate and lustrous that ordinary human beings can look out of place. With one of the three entrances at 4, rue des Petits-Champs, it is situated just north of the stone arcades at the Palais Royal, where the concept of browsing for fashionable items in a series of shops under one roof took hold in the 1780s.Constructed in 1823 and opened to the public three years later, it quickly became a favorite with Parisians, especially artists. Berlioz led crowds here in singing ''La Marseillaise'' to celebrate the revolution of the July monarchy in 1830. By the end of the century, however, it was all but deserted. To bring it back to its former glory, along with its western neighbor, the Galerie Colbert, the French spent lavishly early in this decade. It is now stocked with high-end fashion boutiques (including Nathalie Gar&#231;on and Jean-Paul Gaultier), fun places to eat and drink (Bistrot Vivienne, La Bougainville and the sybaritic &#192; Priori Th&#233;), one of the oldest wine stores in Paris (Legrand Filles &amp; Fils), and an excellent photography gallery (Serge Plantureux).A walk through the Galerie V&#233;ro-Dodat (19, rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau) rounds out a compact tour of the arcades. Stores shape the character of these spaces, and two outstanding 20th-century decorative arts dealers -- the Galerie Eric Philippe and Galerie du Passage -- help V&#233;ro-Dodat to project a more subdued but no less refined sensibility than Galerie Vivienne. The black-and-white marble floor, ball lamps and painted Corinthian columns were restored in the 1980s after almost a century of neglect. (It opened in 1826.) To maintain a level of elegant decorum among the various proprietors, the dealer Robert Capia, whose curiosity shop of antique dolls is a popular stop, has devised three rules: ''no dogs, no phonographs, no parakeets.''The German literary and cultural critic Walter Benjamin spent the final 13 years of his life (he died in 1940, running from the Nazis) trying to fashion a theory of modernity based on the arcades. In their spatial ambiguity -- visitors are both indoors and walking on an extension of the street -- and in the bright scattering of impressions they presented to consumers, he thought he had found a secret history of the 19th century.It's unlikely that he had or ever would have. Unfinished at his death, the project consisted mainly of quotations from his years of reading at the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale. He arranged this montage of snippets under 36 headings, such as ''Fashion,'' ''Boredom,'' ''Advertising,'' ''Prostitution'' and ''Theory of Progress.''His influential writings did, however, legitimize the movement to preserve the arcades in the 1970s and '80s. He is as responsible as any urban planner for their present adoration and recovery. In an irony that he might not have appreciated, and that could perhaps only have happened in Paris, this fierce Marxist critic of the bourgeoisie has made shopping here an intellectual pursuit and unquestionably fashionable again.CULTURED TRAVELER | PARIS</text></article><article id="1832029"><summary>Andrew Yang travel article on new wave of boutique hotels in Shanghai; photos (M)</summary><text>IN recent years, Shanghai has witnessed the appearance of all the accoutrements that befit a quickly growing, cosmopolitan city, with high-end restaurants like Jean Georges and flagship fashion boutiques such as Armani and Dolce &amp; Gabbana popping up in the city's more affluent sections.Until now, one kind of establishment has eluded the city: the boutique hotel. But a new wave of these hotels are opening this year, providing yet another lure to entice the young international travelers who are already flocking to this city, whose transformation is occurring at breathtaking speed.While the label ''boutique'' has evolved in recent years to describe hotels of almost any size that feature a modern design concept, three new establishments -- Jia Shanghai, the Mansion Boutique Hotel and M Suites -- will epitomize the term.Jia Shanghai, an outpost of the popular Philippe Starck-designed Hong Kong hotel, will have 55 rooms, while the Mansion Hotel, in a renovated French villa-style manor, will have just 30 rooms. M Suites, part of a new development on Suzhou Creek, with just 24 rooms, is the most boutique of them all.With major brands racing to open locations in the city -- among them the W, Park Hyatt, the Peninsula and the Mandarin Oriental -- these new establishments represent just a small percentage of the available rooms in the city's vast hospitality landscape. Yet the appeal, in terms of buzz and prestige, is tremendous.In April, Jia Shanghai is to open at 931 West Nanjing Road, (86-21) 6217-9000. Its arrival in Shanghai has been noted in the local press and in international travel publications like Travel &amp; Leisure, and in guidebooks such as the Luxe city-guide series. With just about no hotel experience, Yenn Wong, the 28-year-old Singaporean entrepreneur behind the Jia concept, opened Jia Hong Kong in 2003 with the boutique-hotel originator himself, Mr. Starck, and created a runaway success that was also Hong Kong's first designer boutique property. (Ms. Wong has opted to go with the Australian firm Hecker Phelan &amp; Guthrie to design the Shanghai hotel.)''There are a lot of frequent travelers now, and there are more choices,'' she said. ''Even with Philippe Starck, we downplayed the design of the rooms, and made it more comfortable. And that worked very well.''Jia, which means ''home'' in Chinese, is based on a hotel-as-domestic space concept, where rooms feel like apartments. ''This concept is something we are going to translate to all our other properties,'' she said. Another branch of Jia is to open in Krabi, Thailand, next year.Located within a former apartment building, Jia Shanghai will feature an Italian restaurant on the second floor to be managed by the celebrity chef Salvatore Cuomo, the entrepreneur who has a chain of high-end and mid-priced Italian restaurants throughout Japan. Eventually, a bar and lounge will open on the roof. The interiors will be a series of modern but warm spaces, with touches like timber-paneled walls, a minimal style with hints of chinoiserie, and funky accents like Gio Ponti chairs and sofas by Antonio Citterio.The hotel is entered with a private key card, a move the hotel says is intended to give guests a sense of privacy as well as exclusivity. ''We think there's a niche for this kind of product,'' said Daniel Ong, the hotel's general manager, noting that the rates for the hotel are in the mid-range, with rack rates around $275 a night -- and sometimes lower -- making it more affordable to a younger crowd who are not on corporate accounts.That same fashionable crowd has also been flocking to the Pier One development, along the city's Suzhou Creek. Not too far away from the gallery district, the former Union Brewery has been renovated into a night-life playground, which includes a huge supper club on the ground floor, a rooftop bar and -- sandwiched in between -- M Suites, at 88 Yi Chang Road, (86-21) 5155-8399, or www.msuites.com.cn.Set in a re-landscaped public park, the hotel, which opened in January, features a range of accommodations, from single rooms at 980 yuan (about $130 at 7.9 yuan to the U.S. dollar) to the Empress Suite at 2,888 yuan. While the design is meant to be modern and sleek -- with large flat-screen TVs, and circular beds in some rooms -- it's similiar to what's offered at W hotels.Like the other entrepreneurs, Miao-Miao Jiang, M Suites' executive director, was also quick to emphasize the lack of designer hotels in Shanghai. ''Not many others have done it here,'' she said. ''So I don't think we have too many competitors. Also, who else can be near the downtown business center, with a park, underground parking spaces and a boating dock?'' Indeed, the hotel does feature these amenities, but its location, in a largely industrial area on the edge of the city center, puts it in an unconventional category.If both Jia and M Suites were meant to reflect Shanghai's desire for modern amenities, the Mansion Hotel, at 82 Xinle Road, (86-21) 5403-9888, in the heart of the city's French Concession district, is a complete throwback to the swinging Shanghai of the 1920s.Situated in a French manor-style house that was once the home of a notorious Chinese mob boss, the Mansion Hotel has been rehabilitated from a largely abandoned shell that as recently as last spring had badly sagging wood floors. With its gut renovation completed last month, this charming five-story limestone structure has been painstakingly restored into a 30-room property that feels more like a member's club for the Fortune 500 set.Right before the hotel's partial opening last month, its developer, Lu-Jun Yin, cranked an old Columbia gramophone from 1910, and instantly the cavernous lobby, with its 15-foot ceilings, filled with a 1920s recording of the Beijing opera singer Mei Lanfang.''We wanted to make this hotel part of the story we want to tell about old Shanghai,'' he said, noting the other classic vintage antiques housed in the new glass cases all throughout the hotel's lobby. Every detail of the hotel reflects the building's former grandeur, said Mr. Yin, now the chief executive officer of Boutique Hotels International, which is behind the development of the Mansion Hotel. In the French Concession on Xinle Road, a trendy corridor that includes coffee shops, wine bars and independent fashion boutiques, the Mansion Hotel is discreetly tucked behind a gated courtyard that has a manicured garden with a small pond.Trying to create a hospitality experience steeped in history was an idea Mr. Yin first explored when he was general manager of Xintiandi several years ago, and opened 88 Xintiandi, the complex's signature hotel. While that project was in a new building surrounded by old shikumen, or traditional Shanghai courtyard houses, the idea had stayed with him ever since. ''I really think it's a new way to retain the city's character,'' Mr. Yin said.Because of the crowd that the hotel hopes to attract -- corporate executives and other elite travelers -- the hotel is commanding possibly the highest rates anywhere in Shanghai, with $550 for a basic room to $880 for suites. Each room has 15-foot ceilings and a large Jacuzzi.The Mansion's rooftop has been renovated into a bar, which looks out over the low rooftops of the French Concession. Since the hotel is small, Mr. Yin said, the public facilities, such as the first-floor lounge, the private dining rooms and the rooftop, are available primarily to guests staying at the hotel. Special key cards for entry will be issued to select friends and associates of the hotel, giving the Mansion a clubhouse-like feel.While all of these new boutique hotels seem to signal the city's rising glamour among international travelers, these properties have all arrived, seemingly simultaneously, because of a shared belief that the market is finally ready.''Until now, the need has not been fulfilled,'' said Ms. Wong, of Jia Shanghai. ''The people who will stay with us are not people who will normally stay in megahotels. They are a discerning lot.''The success of these establishments will depend on their personalities, she noted, and to a degree the personalities of their developers.Ms. Wong said the recent wave of boutique hotels may be just the beginning. Already, there is talk about other properties around the city, including another location in the French Concession and another vacant site on the riverfront Bund district that is under development.''In the next few years,'' she predicted, ''there will be a boom in boutique hotels.''JOURNEYS | SHANGHAI</text></article><article id="1832030"><summary>Pableaux Johnson reviews 21c Museum Hotel in Louisville, Ky; photo (M)</summary><text>THE BASICSAt Louisville's newest boutique hotel, every employee is a de facto docent bubbling with the energy of new discovery. ''Trust me,'' said the bellman. ''You've got to see the public bathrooms on the first floor.'' Our waitress steered us to elaborate woodcuts in the hotel restaurant's hidden banquet room. Opened in April 2006 and designed by Deborah Berke &amp; Partners, the 21c Museum Hotel strikes a delicate artistic balance by presenting contemporary artwork -- at turns haunting, light-hearted and challenging -- in space that does double duty as public art museum and money-making upscale hotel. More MoMA than ''match the sofa'' aesthetic, the rotating collection also includes video installations and sonic environmental pieces. Waiting for the elevator, you'll have time to appreciate Chuck Close's ''Lucas,'' a 1999 portrait in woven silk and linen. Many pieces are from the private collection of the owner-developers, Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson. From the four-foot red polyethylene penguins on the Main Street facade to the video works in the lounge off the lobby, the 21c's collection is never more than a glance away.THE LOCATIONIn the heart of downtown Louisville, the 91-room hotel complex is two blocks from the Ohio River. It's a short walk from the new Muhammad Ali Center, the glitzy Fourth Street Live entertainment strip and the Kentucky International Convention Center.THE ROOMSOur river-view king room mimicked an efficient live/work loft space: a feather duvet and locally woven throw blanket covered luxurious 500-thread-count sheets; exposed brick walls played against brushed steel and neutral gray carpets. Road warriors will welcome the well-designed workspace with Herman Miller Aeron chair, wireless Internet service, a cordless phone and an anodized aluminum desk. Less productive types will flop down in the comfortable reading chair to unwind with the in-room iPod.Etched silver-plated julep cups replace standard in-room glassware; a single-cup Flavia coffeemaker marks a distinct improvement on the standard in-room java experience. A nearly overwhelming 42-inch flat-screen plasma television hugs the brick wall. The river view was nominal at best -- less panoramic than disappointing ''down the block'' oblique -- not worth the $30 upgrade from a standard king room.THE BATHROOMSSufficient but a little cramped compared with the well-lighted comfortable room. A few flourishes (a full range of Malin + Goetz toiletries, pillowy robes, a yellow rubber ducky for the tub) add a little bit of fun to an otherwise unremarkable space.AMENITIESSelections from the museum's collection and curated exhibitions appear around every turn -- from the cavernous basement-level gallery to the banquette walls at Proof on Main, the hotel's equally sophisticated restaurant. Run by Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group -- the folks who gave you Nobu and the Tribeca Grill -- Proof is one of the city's hottest dining tickets, with riffs on Tuscan favorites. Michael Paley's double-smoked ham salad with bourbon aoli ($9) and Kentucky bison burger ($14) anchor the earthier side of the menu, and cracker-thin truffled mushroom pizza ($10) and nightly specials ($15 to $23) highlight the Mediterranean connection.ROOM SERVICEProof's kitchen and bar provide a limited room service menu during standard kitchen hours, including 5 selections from their 60-whiskey lineup. (This is bourbon country, after all.) Breakfast options reflect Proof's delicate touch with smoked salmon with citrus vinaigrette ($11) and light brioche French toast ($11) edging out standard morning options. The plates arrived piping hot at the designated time.BOTTOM LINEAn innovative concept with strong execution and prompt and enthusiastic service. Allow plenty of time for exploring 21c's less obvious exhibition spaces, including, as the bellman suggests, those infamous artistic restrooms. Weekend rates on the hotel's Web site run from $109 for a double room to $349 for the corner suite.21c Hotel Museum; 700 West Main Street, Louisville, Ky.; (502) 217-6300.PABLEAUX JOHNSON  CHECK IN / CHECK OUT</text></article><article id="1832031"><summary>Chris Colin travel article on changes that have come to once tacky strip of Lombard Strip in San Francisco, Calif; photo; map (M)</summary><text>LOMBARD STREET in San Francisco has long been regarded as a clogged access road to the Golden Gate Bridge, a tacky strip of old motor inns, dingy storefronts and aging gas stations. But like the Tenderloin and other districts that have gone from cheap to almost chic, this faded mile in the Marina District is sitting on real estate too valuable to stay gritty.In recent years, a handful of trendy shops and restaurants have drawn fresh life to Lombard Street, giving its endearing seediness something of a stylish polish.Most noticeable is La Luna Inn (2599 Lombard Street, 415-346-4664; www.lalunainn.com). Once just another dreary pastel box, the motel has been renovated and repackaged, its kitschy 1960s style accentuated to give a spiffy retro look, with an ''I Spy'' palette of bright blues and beiges and simple modern furnishings. Rooms from $69 weekdays, $79 on weekends.Down the street, the similarly remodeled Hotel del Sol (3100 Webster Street, 415-921-5520; www.thehoteldelsol.com) sports a carnival-like motif of colorful pool umbrellas and palm trees. Rooms from $119 weekdays; higher on weekends.''Everything's getting fancier,'' said Rick McKay, a waiter at the nearby Mel's Drive-In, of the 1950s-style diner chain made famous in ''American Graffiti'' (2165 Lombard Street, 415-921-2867; www.melsdrive-in.com). ''Even the old stuff starts looking new.''If La Luna and the Del Sol are playing up the street's nostalgia, then the restaurant Hime (2353 Lombard Street, 415-931-7900; www.himerestaurant.com) is modernizing it with bamboo walls and candlelit bathrooms. This sleek sushi restaurant draws a nightly crowd of Pacific Heights lawyers and unagi purists. The extensive menu includes a bluefin tuna sashimi, imported from Japan, that arrives atop a throne of packed ice ($16.80).''George Lucas stopped in here the other day,'' said Derek May, the chef at Hime. (Mr. Lucas's Letterman Digital Arts Center is nearby.) ''I think the seediness of all those motels is changing, and so the rest of the street's changing, too.''The street is still somewhat forbidding at night -- though that, too, is starting to change. Low rents have allowed fashionable upstarts like the Mercury Appetizer Bar (1434 Lombard Street, 415-922-1434; www.mercurysf.com) to move in, offering saketinis alongside Asian bar food like banana-leaf-wrapped tilapia ($9). Breakfast and brunch are also served.Also popular is Silver Clouds (1994 Lombard Street, 415-922-1977), a karaoke bar with a mishmash d&#233;cor of neon Budweiser electric guitars and ornate chandeliers. It attracts old drinkers and young professionals alike, as well as the occasional tourist who happens by.Invariably, non-San Franciscans hear ''Lombard'' and still picture the flowery curves of ''the world's crookedest street,'' up over Russian Hill. But locals see a lovability in the grimy old shops, the ancient fonts on their signs -- and the location. The Presidio National Park, the Palace of Fine Arts, Crissy Field and the Golden Gate Bridge are all minutes away by car.''It's a weird street,'' said Melanie Shain, owner of the recently opened Past Perfect (2246 Lombard Street, 415-929-2288), an antiques shop that sells vintage furnishings, glassware and decorative items. ''I never thought I'd see it change.''SURFACING | LOMBARD STREET, SAN FRANCISCO</text></article><article id="1832032"><summary>Mark Bittman reviews O Dezaseis restaurant in Santiago de Compostela, Spain; photos (M)</summary><text>SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA has been a tourist town for a millennium; it looks like one, too, with its massive central cathedral, huge central squares, and ancient hotel, now a parador. So finding the right restaurant there is about as challenging as it is in Disneyland. But just outside the old part of town is an important huge university and a part of the city geared not to tourists but to students and locals.When I was advised to try a restaurant in that area, O Dezaseis -- or 16, as it's widely known -- I was a little dubious. It feels like many European tourist traps: subterranean, a little cavelike, an intentionally charming converted stable of brick and stone and wood, probably 300 years old, with wooden tables and chairs, and with farm and cooking implements hanging from walls and ceilings.On the other hand, it's not bad looking. And once I started eating, reservations fell away with my hunger. You'll see, as you walk in, a huge wheel of empanada with tuna and piment&#243;n (Spanish paprika). Get some -- it's spicy and flavorful, as it should be (but so often is not) in Galicia, the home of empanadas.Galicia is also the world capital of pulpo -- octopus -- as far as I can tell. At 16, it's cooked until tender, then tossed on the plancha (a super-hot griddle) and sprinkled with smoked piment&#243;n (above). In a region where every town has several pulper&#237;as -- restaurants specializing in pulpo -- 16's was exceptional.What I had are tapaslike dishes, but they're raciones, bigger plates and meant to be shared. Still, almost all these dishes were under 10 euros ($13.50 at $1.35 to the euro), and out of a dozen or so there were maybe two losers. The clear winners were the pulpo; razor clams &#224; la plancha, with just lemon; tender boiled veal chuck with nothing more than piment&#243;n and olive oil; and, perhaps best of all, lac&#243;n (the local cured and cooked ham) with chorizo and grelos (broccoli rabe, a Galician obsession) -- a simply perfect combination.Even the desserts (3.50 euros) are good: fresh cheese with walnuts and strawberries, and a wonderful cheese flan. And the wine list is astonishing: my table of four had two bottles of a superb albari&#241;o, at 10.50 euros each.I no longer need to find the cheapest place in town, but 16 happens to be among them, making the quality of the food all the more incredible.O Dezaseis, Rua San Pedro 16, Santiago de Compostela; (34-981) 564-880; www.dezaseis.com.MARK BITTMANBITES</text></article><article id="1832033"><summary>Michelle Higgins Practical Traveler column on visit to Dubai on a budget; drawing (M)</summary><text>DUBAI on a budget sounds like an oxymoron. The most ostentatious of the seven city states of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai is where travelers go to find a self-proclaimed seven-star hotel, indoor skiing and artificial islands springing up from the seas in the shape of palm trees. A stay at that ''seven-star'' hotel, the sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, starts at more than $2,000 a night.Yet now a number of budget hotel chains are moving into this playground for the rich. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the serial entrepreneur who founded the budget airline easyJet, was in Dubai two weeks ago to break ground on the first of six easyHotels to be built in the emirate.The hotels, based on the easyHotel model introduced in Europe in 2005, will have rooms a little bigger than those in existing easyHotels -- but still small, around 160 square feet, with just the basics, including a bed, a shower, a flat-screen television and an Internet connection. Prices won't be announced until the opening, but are expected to be around 250 to 300 dirhams, or about $67 to $80 a night at 3.75 dirhams to the dollar.InterContinental Hotels plans to open its first Holiday Inn Express in Dubai this summer; with 244 rooms, the hotel will be significantly larger than its counterparts in the United States.Ibis, an economy brand of Accor, the giant French hotel company, which already has one hotel in Dubai, plans to expand with a 480-room hotel there in December and a 365-room hotel in 2008. The existing Ibis World Trade Center Dubai, linked to the International Exhibition Center and Convention Center of Dubai, has rooms from around 70 euros, $95 a night at $1.35 to the euro. And Whitbread's budget brand, Premier Travel Inn, Britain's biggest hotel chain, is building a 300-room hotel at the Dubai Investments Park. Room rates are expected to be in the 400-dirham range.The extreme emphasis on luxury in Dubai over the last decade is precisely why the market for budget travel is wide open. While most hotel guests continue to stay at high-end places, statistics show a growing demand for lower-priced accommodations.The number of guests who stayed in five-star luxury hotels in Dubai increased just 10 percent, to nearly 2 million, in 2005 from the previous year, according to the latest statistics available online from the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. By contrast, the number staying in one-star, limited-service hotels jumped 32 percent in that same time, to about 600,000.It's not only hotels that have taken notice of the budget traveler. Anticipating a shift toward more economical vehicles in the next few years, Hertz is adding small cars like the Honda Jazz hatchback and Toyota Yaris to its Dubai fleet -- cars that rent for about $55 a day, compared with $110 for a mid-size vehicle or $220 for an S.U.V.''The place has gotten very expensive,'' said Bob Farrow, general manager of Hertz Car Rental in Dubai. ''Everybody would love to drive a big car on vacation, but they want to pay for a small one.''Five years ago, small cars made up just 10 percent of the fleet at his outlet, but in the next year or so, Hertz plans to increase that to about 25 percent.While more travel companies are catering to budget travelers in Dubai, for now it can still be difficult to find the cheaper alternatives. A call asking about budget options a couple of weeks ago left a spokeswoman flummoxed at the New York office promoting Dubai tourism.''We really focus on the high end,'' she said. ''Truly, it's a luxury market.''The head office in Dubai wasn't much more help. Asked by e-mail about typical rates and recommendations for travelers on tight budgets, Mohamed Abdul Mannan, a spokesman for the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, replied with just one line -- a Web address for an online article about the recent easyHotels announcement of plans to build there.The spectacle of modern Dubai is a product of many years of intensive development. Once a fishing and pearl-diving village, it grew into a modest commercial city in the 19th century and wasn't transformed into a metropolis until the last couple of decades. Even as Dubai's reputation as a luxury travel destination took off, savvy travelers continued to score deals -- although less remarkable ones as time went on -- even without the new influx of budget chains.''My wallet has seen the changes,'' said Jesse Long, 34, a photographer in Brooklyn who has been traveling to Dubai on business for the last five years. Hotels where he used to stay for $30 or $40 a night are now charging four times more, he said, ''and they haven't really improved anything.''To get the best deal, Mr. Long stays in the central Bur Dubai district, where modestly priced accommodations can still be found, particularly along Khalid Bin Waleed Road. Last month, he stayed at the Hotel Ascot (www.ascothoteldubai.com) in that area for about $130 a night and dined at nearby Indian restaurants for less than $5 a meal.For discounted hotel accommodations, he recommends www.wired-destinations.com.It's also possible to find a bargain by consulting the tourism desk at the airport, but to avoid any confusion later, be sure to get the terms in writing, including the rate and any incentives, like free breakfast.Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, when people of Muslim faith fast from dawn to dusk, can be a good time to find bargains since hotels tend to be less crowded and may be more willing to negotiate on price. (This year, the start of Ramadan, which varies slightly by region, begins around Sept. 12.)While working hours are slightly altered and many restaurants are closed much of the day, there is an air of festivity after dark, said Daniela Bonanno, a sales manager at Absolute Travel in New York who has visited Dubai during Ramadan. ''After sunset, everyone celebrates because that's when they can eat,'' Ms. Bonanno said.Shops and malls stay open longer, and hotels and restaurants offer special Iftar buffets to break the fast.If you're on a budget, you might want to avoid traveling during the wildly popular Dubai Shopping Festival, which typically runs from late December through January, when you'll face high rates as you compete for rooms with crowds of well-heeled travelers.PRACTICAL TRAVELER | A BARGAIN EMIRATE</text></article><article id="1832035"><summary>Susan Catto travel article on visit to Calgary, Alberta; photo; map (M)</summary><text>THERE was a time, not so many years ago, when the only reasons most tourists would bother venturing into Calgary was for the two-week rodeo festival in July or as a stop on the way to the Banff mountain resort, some 80 miles west. But this rugged city in central Alberta is undergoing an energetic revitalization brought on by an oil boom, and its population, according to the Calgary Civic Census, has increased nearly 30 percent in the last decade, to almost 992,000.For visitors, all this activity means a revived downtown core with restaurants whose chefs -- and prices -- could vie with those in Toronto or Montreal; spruced-up, outlying neighborhoods; and new places to stay like the Hotel Arts near the cultural heart of the city, or, the west-end Sandman Hotel &amp; Suites, just across from Canada Olympic Park, site of the 1988 Winter Games. But perhaps most surprising, is that the Heart of the New West, as Calgary is billing itself these days, is becoming known as a center of culture, with diverse entertainment options and an expanding museum scene.Calgary is home to Canada's biggest oil and gas companies and the administrative headquarters of the $50 billion oil sands extraction projects centered 470 miles north in Fort McMurray, Alberta, and is certainly not the most obvious spot for a cultural renaissance. "We've always had this image as being a city without a history, or perhaps a city without real culture,'' said Kelly Lewis, a manager at Tourism Calgary.Founded in 1884, Calgary's initial prosperity was based on sandstone quarries. Oil was discovered in 1914, and a boom-bust cycle repeated itself in the 1920s, 1950s, and 1980s. During busts, the city hollowed out; during booms, it was the Houston of Canada, complete with cowboy hats and swagger. But even in good times, it never had much of a reputation for cultural innovation.That is changing as quickly as everything else. Some of the biggest creative names in Canada are choosing to introduce their new works in Calgary. ''Frobisher,'' an opera by John Estacio and John Murrell set in Canada's far north, had its premiere at the Calgary Opera Centre in late January. ''The Fiddle and the Drum,'' a new ballet created by Joni Mitchell with Jean Grand-Ma&#238;tre, the artistic director of the Alberta Ballet, opened to sell-out audiences last month. The downtown Epcor Centre for the Performing Arts houses -- with style -- several theater and performance groups and plays host to visiting performers. This year's annual festival of new Canadian plays presented by Epcor's resident company, the Alberta Theater Projects, had three world premieres by Toronto playwrights as well as two shows by Albertans. The theatrical event of the spring is Theater Calgary's April co-production (with troupes in Toronto and Edmonton) of ''The Overcoat'' by Morris Panych and Wendy Gorling, and based on stories by Gogol and music by Shostakovich. And later this month, the Glenbow Museum will open a 24,000-square-foot gallery devoted to the modern history of Alberta. There is also a two-year-old gallery dedicated to Alberta's original inhabitants, the Blackfoot Indians, as well as an incongruous, but beautiful collection of early Asian sculpture.''There's a commitment to the cultural sector, which is being backed up by money,'' said Beth Gignac, manager of the city's arts and culture division, who herself moved to Calgary only last July from the Toronto area.If visitors can easily fill their nights with plays and music -- for instance, the Beat Niq Jazz &amp; Social Club has live shows most nights and the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra keeps a busy schedule that includes Saturday morning and lunchtime concerts -- there's also plenty to see around town in the day. The honey-hued sandstone buildings lining the Stephen Avenue Walk, a pedestrian mall between First Street SW and Sixth Street SW, date from the late 1880s, after a disastrous fire led city officials to decree that all large buildings be sandstone. Today the street is filled with shops and restaurants, including the new Blink supper club and several pricey steakhouses, like the Belvedere and Saltlik, which serve the ubiquitous AAA Alberta beef, as well as the top-drawer seafood restaurant Catch. High-end Italian is Calgary's hottest flavor right now, with new restaurants like Capo in the Inglewood neighborhood and Pulcinella in Kensington garnering notice from both critics and diners.As condominiums spring up along the Bow River, neighborhoods on the edge of downtown are becoming destinations, too. Among the standouts in Kensington, a trendy shopping and residential area just over the Louise Bridge, is an outpost of the Calgary-based chocolatier Bernard Callebaut; Livingstone and Cavell Extraordinary Toys, which, though small, lives up to its name; and the Higher Grounds Cafe, a bustling coffeehouse among numerous independent coffee shops in this caffeinated town. This is prime shopping and strolling territory for a population prosperous enough to afford the lobster lasagna or venison chop with wild boar bacon at the local favorite Muse, but young enough to desire a bit of bohemia in their shopping district.Inglewood, often cited as the next Kensington, remains a neighborhood in transition. To reach the increasingly upscale blocks of antique stores, home furnishing shops and quirky boutiques, you'll have to pass notably ungentrified blocks with dive bars, and local people say, the occasional crack house. But it's worth the walk for destination restaurants like Spolumbo's, a casual sausage house and deli founded by some local football heros, or Rouge, a romantic high-end French restaurant in a historic house.The Calgary Zoo in Inglewood has not been excluded from the development surge either: with $35 million from the provincial surplus, it has opened new sections devoted to African and nocturnal animals. A new elephant area opens this summer, and a massive indoor northern ecosystem with a saltwater aquarium is planned.Calgary also has a small Chinatown -- no longer the main sign of cultural diversity in a city that has African, Latino and Reggae festivals as well as a full complement of international restaurants.''I've been saying since I got here, I wish they could lift off the white cowboy hat,'' said Ms. Gignac, who, like many newcomers, initially expected the city to be all western, all the time. ''There's a lot going on beneath that cowboy hat,'' she added.While the beneficiaries of Calgary's boom are easy to spot, it's not all good news for long-term residents. Tom Booth, a young lawyer who was buying wine on Stephen Avenue, noted that the population influx has meant a huge rise in living costs and an encroachment on the space and independence Calgarians once took for granted. Downtown parking lots charge up to $30 a day and homes in former working-class suburbs are selling for close to $850,000, pushing out the middle class, not to mention the poor. ''It's forced Calgary to think about how to be a big city,'' Mr. Booth said.Meanwhile, at the long tiled bar at the fashionable Metropolitan Grill on Eighth Avenue SW at the top of Stephen Avenue's sandstone row, casually dressed young professionals -- many recent arrivals from someplace else -- were meeting and eating. But will they still be here if and when the most recent oil boom ends?Gonzalo Vivanco, an engineer who came here as a child, thinks they will.''We had a boom in the '80s, but not like this,'' said Mr. Vivanco, who was enjoying a steak. ''It's just so much bigger.''Like many residents here, Mr. Vivanco believes that this time, with new investments-- and hard-earned wisdom -- Calgary has finally created an economy and culture appealing enough to keep newcomers in town, even if the oil boom slows.RIDING HIGHER WITH THE BOOM IN OILFlights from New York to Calgary begin at about $440 round trip on United or Air Canada.WHERE TO STAYKensington Riverside Inn, 1126 Memorial Drive NW; (877) 313-3733; www.kensingtonriversideinn.com.

So does that mean weekend visitors who own a graying mane or, the horror, receive a regular Social Security check, must head from a pricey meal, Broadway show or Lincoln Center concert and straight to bed without even a cocktail?Of course not. They just have to look for the tip-offs that indicate that a bar attracts a more mature crowd, the kind that doesn't trust anyone under 40.Those helpful hints include an upscale, old-school setting (though downscale, old-school Irish bars work pretty well, too); background music that stays where it belongs -- in the background; and closing hours earlier than the city-prescribed limit. There's no need to stay open till 4 in the morning if a good part of your clientele wakes up at 7 without an alarm clock.And there's the added bonus of civility. Middle-age-and-up bar patrons are bar patrons not because it's the default activity on a weekend night, but because they enjoy bars. Perhaps for that reason, their conversations are not as stilted as younger drinkers', but more like a collegial chat between strangers brought together by a taste for fine Scotch than hormonally charged gamesmanship.One classic spot is Bemelmans, with its comfy chairs, waiters in uniform and quirky murals (and lampshade art) drawn by Ludwig Bemelmans, creator of the Madeline children's books. You will probably find at least a 40-year difference between the youngest patron and the oldest (and also between the youngest employee and the oldest). A jazz trio and drinks like the gin-gin mule (gin, homemade ginger beer, fresh mint and lime juice; $16) make the place, in the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, ooze timelessness.Other classics include the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis Hotel and the evening incarnation of the Grill Room at the Four Seasons restaurant. The general rule is, the older the establishment, the older the crowd and the more refined the atmosphere. (The new boutique spots skew younger and louder.)The Algonquin attaches its Round Table literary cachet to its several drinking spots. The purest bar scene is the Blue Bar, which has its own entrance and takes its mixed drinks seriously enough to claim that the rye-and-bitters Sazerac ($15) is ''one of America's greatest cocktails resurrected from its Southern cocktail tomb.'' Not all is so serious: there's also a drink named after Matilda, the hotel's cat.But being timeless is not a requirement. The Bar Room at the Modern (attached to the Museum of Modern Art) is a slick spot with creative drinks where three well-dressed generations could gather at the bar or adjacent tables and everyone would feel comfortable.The Bar Room doesn't even skimp on music you might hear amid a younger lounge crowd, from neo-soul to French pop to thumping electronic beats. In this case, though, the throb is more like a distant heartbeat than a having a woofer channeled directly into your eardrum.The Modern's drink menu is conversation-worthy, too. There's its most popular drink, Coming Up Roses, a concoction of rosewater, rose petals, champagne, rum and lime that inspires oohs and aahs from bar neighbors ($12), as well as the signature Modern Martini ($14), made with their own cilantro-infused gin and whose iffy taste might make you question the whole infusion-spirits movement.But there's something for everyone there: the beer list is quirky, with a local favorite, Brooklyn Pilsner ($7), squaring off against choices like the Troubadour Obscura stout from Belgium ($15) and Magic Hat from Vermont ($7). And Reed's Premium ginger beer and Ithaca root beer ($5) mean that even teetotalers have drink choices worth talking about.Steakhouse bars, for some reason, tend to attract a mixed-age crowd, and there are plenty of choices. At Wolfgang's on Park Avenue, the bar is often crowded, with everyone from business types dining alone as they play BrickBreaker on their BlackBerrys to couples in their 40s making out as if they can't afford a room. If those activities don't appeal to you, check out the Gustavino-tiled vaulted ceilings or chat with the friendly bartenders.THERE are plenty of New Yorkers who have been lamenting the death of the smoke-filled room since the 2003 smoking ban (and that's not including the dry cleaners who profited handsomely from day-after business). But those lamenters still have a few places to go, like the oversize Club Macanudo on the Upper East Side or the undersize Velvet Cigar Lounge in the East Village (and Williamsburg, Brooklyn).The Carnegie Club is another such spot imported from another era, especially on Saturday nights, when Steve Maglio and the Stan Rubin Orchestra perform their well-regarded Sinatra show. Though the tobacco and drink minimum can annoy -- you're not going to make it out of there for less than $100 a couple, no matter what -- it's worth it for the time travel.And with the first show at 8:30, the early-to-bed crowd can sip a vintage cocktail, puff on a Dominican cigar and listen to ''The Way You Look Tonight'' -- even if they maintain a slight preference for the way they looked, say, three decades ago.NIGHTCAPS, NOT NOISEBar Room at the Modern, 9 West 53rd Street, (212) 333-1220; www.themodernnyc.com.Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600; www.thecarlyle.com.Blue Bar at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800; www.algonquinhotel.com.Carnegie Club, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676; www.hospitalityholdings.com.Club Macanudo, 26 East 63rd Street, (212) 752-8200; www.clubmacanudo.com.Four Seasons Restaurant, 99 East 52nd Street, (212) 754-9494; www.fourseasonsrestaurant.com.King Cole Bar at the St. Regis Hotel, 2 East 55th Street, (212), 753-4500; www.starwoodhotels.com/stregis.Velvet Cigar Lounge, 80 East Seventh Street (near First Avenue), (212) 533-5582; and 174 Broadway (near Driggs Avenue), in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, (718) 302-4427; www.velvetcigars.com.Wolfgang's Steakhouse, 4 Park Avenue (East 33rd Street), (212) 889-3369; and 409 Greenwich Street, (at Hubert Street), (212) 925-0350; www.wolfgangssteakhouse.com.WEEKEND IN NEW YORK | MATURE NIGHTLIFE</text></article><article id="1832045"><summary>Chapter 7 of Michael Chabon's novel Gentlemen of the Road; drawing (L)</summary><text>In an effort to free Amram, Hanukkah and Filaq, Zelikman has tracked the Arsiyah, who have ridden hard to defend a city whose mosques and people have already been laid siege to by the Northmen, also known as the Rus. Zelikman puts his gifts as a healer to use on the victims and stumbles upon his traveling companions.Hanukkah had been kicked awake by worse men, among them his own father, and so the curses he muttered, with his eyes shut and the honeyed hand of a dream still caressing his thigh, extended no further into history than the African's great-grandmother and confined themselves to envisioning her use by scabby Pecheneg stallions, making only glancing reference to the attentions of Bactrian camels. The true object of Hanukkah's spleen was wakefulness itself and the world that it would oblige his five outraged senses to certify. Hanukkah had soldiered in the army of an empire at peace and had thus dealt and witnessed death only in small batches, and he was shocked by the scale of slaughter he had seen today, wrought by foreign invaders against Khazar men and women like him -- children of Kozar the son of Togarmah the son of Gomer the son of Japheth the son of Noah, people of the felt walls, burners of dung fires, sworn to the solitary god of the clear blue sky, whether that god was called Tengri, Jehovah or Allah, and shocked most of all by the pointless butchering of a stranded Rus, mute, dazed and trembling with some fever, white as a fish belly, hair as pale as horse butter, who was dragged by the Arsiyah from his hiding place and slashed open like a gushing sack of wine. After that, Hanukkah curled up on the steps of the mosque and withdrew into sleep and his dream of Sarah, of the faint smell of burning sandalwood when she took his head into her lap, a dream from which Amram's horny toe now dislodged him with all the tenderness of a boathook.Hanukkah sat up, and opened his eyes, and saw amid the smoke, dust devils and steady snow of ash a gaunt, bloodied figure, tottering, asleep on his feet, his black cloak crusted and dragging behind him, the air around him wavering in a madness of flies.At the sight of the Frank who had saved his life, Hanukkah felt something swell inside him, like the bladder that kept a sturgeon buoyant and swimming true in the dark of the Khazar Sea. Men could be broken more terribly than he had ever imagined; but they could also be repaired. Hope was a powerful cordial, and for a moment, with the burn of it at the back of Hanukkah's throat, he could only stand there, barking like a goose. Then he wiped his face on his filthy sleeve and hurried to Zelikman's side.''Sit,'' he said, ''please.''He sat the Frank down on the steps, pulled off his boots and fetched some water from a cistern. Some of the water he mixed with wine and passed to Zelikman in an overturned steel helmet. The rest he used to wash the blood from Zelikman's hands and face and to bathe his feet. From this mild and voluntary act of self-abasement, from the routine business of cistern and dipper and the wringing of a cloth, from the Frank's pale and horny feet with their surprisingly soft ankles, Hanukkah derived a measure of comfort and regained his spirits. He found out a neglected passage behind the mosque that the Rus had disdained to plunder, and in a cellar there a pair of toothless old sisters who at extortionate prices provided him with cold porridge, some lentils and mint, a bag of apples and the butt of a lamb sausage. He gave the food to Zelikman, who ate, and drank, and rested, talking to the African in Greek or Latin.The subject of their conversation appeared to be Filaq, who sat slumped on the steps of the mosque with his chin in his hands, wearing a mask of tear streaks and ash. The stripling had scarcely moved in the hours since the Arsiyah mercenaries had paroled their prisoners to shift for themselves, saying nothing at all for what struck Hanukkah as an abnormally long period of time. With his smudged cheeks and staring eyes he seemed younger than ever, a child with an empty belly too weary to sleep. He did not appear to notice when the Arsiyah at last came trudging out of the mosque and clattering down the steps around him, stooped as by time or a heavy load, their gait uncertain, their evening lifting of their voices toward far-off Mecca having done little to ease the painful knowledge of their failure to defend this Muhammadan town from destruction by the Northmen. They loitered in the square, cast down, aimless. Their commander was dead, drowned in the collapse of the wharves. The surviving captains could not come to agreement on whether they ought to pursue and punish the Rus or return to Atil and face condemnation, possibly execution, by the bek for having disobeyed his direct order that no one interfere with or harass the Northmen in their ''trading mission'' among the peoples of the littoral. This order was accompanied -- nestled, as it were, like a love letter in the sleeve of a go-between -- by rumors that it was these same ambitious Northmen who had backed the new bek in his coup; but an order it remained. Now the Arsiyah, whose most prized asset as with all mercenary elites was not their skill at arms and horsemanship or fearsome reputation but the stainless banner of their loyalty, found themselves confronted by the dawning awareness that the only thing less forgivable than a mutiny was a mutiny that failed.''They will go south, to Derbent,'' said the first captain, a florid, gaunt man bleeding from a dozen cuts, naming the next great Muslim town on the littoral. ''We must anticipate them there.''His fellow captain, stout and languid of manner, pointed out the unlikeliness of their arriving at Derbent in time or force enough to stop the Northmen, who had the advantage of a prevailing north wind, and then by way of epilogue composed on the spot an unfavorable judgment on the gaunt captain's intelligence in even offering such a futile suggestion. The two officers were separated by their men only long enough to permit a general exchange of insults that soon devolved into a melee. In the course of the fighting, the lean captain ran onto the sword point of the stocky one and added his own life to the day's grim total and to the slick, rank slurry of blood and dust that filmed the square.A shrill horseman's whistle split the air, and the soldiers abandoned the violence of their grief and turned to listen to the words of a trooper who had stayed out of the fracas, a wiry, bowlegged veteran nearly as grizzled as Amram, one of those men of no great rank or bravery who by virtue of heartlessness, opportunism and a long streak of luck outlasted all their fellows and so ranked as secret commanders of their troops. When this old veteran had the ears of his comrades, he explained, with patience and regret, and with Hanukkah keeping up a whispered translation into Arabic for the benefit of Amram and Zelikman, that they must now consider their company disbanded and, each man taking a share of water and food, and a horse, scatter to the winds and the mountains, like drops of mercury on a rumpled carpet. In Hanukkah's view there was merit in this suggestion, but it was so greatly outweighed by shame and ignominy that a number of Arsiyah, unable to refute the old veteran's wisdom, sat down in the shadow of the mosque and cried.The spectacle of weeping cavalrymen seemed to have a stimulating effect on Filaq. He rose to his feet, nose wrinkled as if in disgust, fists balled at his sides, and called for the men's attention. In his thin and reedy voice, he harangued the troopers in terms that made the most hardened soldiers among them flush, while those who had been lamenting fell silent. One or two sniggered at the youth's use of a particularly vile Bulgar epithet and smiled at each other under lowered brows.''What does he say?'' Zelikman asked Hanukkah.''He says,'' Hanukkah said in a whisper, ''that he has a proposition to make, but it is to be heard only by men in full possession of their manhood, and not by a mob of blubbering grandmothers who would spare the Northmen the trouble of gelding them by performing that service upon themselves.''''What proposition?''''I can only imagine,'' Hanukkah said, ''having sampled his wares in that line a week ago, sitting around the fire with my fellow gentlemen of the road.''But now that Filaq had the attention of the soldiers, he seemed to lose his nerve or his taste for handing out abuse, and wavered, blinking and swallowing, as if the thread of his own argument now eluded him. Amram studied him, glanced at Hanukkah, then rubbing his chin contemplated the soldiery, who stood in the square gazing down at their bloody buskins like farmhands awaiting the lash. In one of their Western tongues Amram put a solemn question to Zelikman, whose import appeared to consist in assessing the Frankish Jew's readiness for some hard business whose profit was outweighed by its impracticability. Zelikman's face expressed first grave reservation and then utter lack of interest. Amram went to Filaq and took up a place just behind and to the right of him.''Go on,'' Amram told him, in passable Khazari, giving him a gentle push. ''Do it.''Filaq pushed back, the expression on his face wondering and doubtful, reluctant and eager, returned for an instant to childishness.''It isn't going to work,'' he said.''Probably not,'' Amram agreed. ''It's a really terrible idea. But it seems that nobody here has a better one.''Filaq nodded and climbed to the top step of the mosque. He ran the back of a hand across his forehead and stood looking down at the weary soldiers, searching for the words to wake them.''Do they know who he is?'' Zelikman said. ''Who his father was?''''They will now,'' Hanukkah said.So Filaq told his story, turning fine phrases in the dialect of the palaces and gardens. He asked them first to remember the fair and temperate rule of his father, the late bek, of whom, he now revealed, he was the youngest son. At this there was a murmuring among the soldiers, and one of them said that indeed Filaq resembled very strongly the late bekun, whom the soldier had seen once during the festivities attending the Feast of Tabernacles in Atil.Next Filaq reminded them of the kindness and consideration that his late father had always shown his Muslim subjects, and above all his faithful Arsiyah mercenaries, of whom he, Filaq, had heard it said and been ready to believe that they were the very last troops in the Army of Khazaria to swear loyalty to the usurper Buljan. The Arsiyah agreed that this could not be gainsaid, and a notion of the business the youth was about to propose began to blow among the enervated and downcast soldiers like a wind through dry rushes.''We can be at the gates of Atil in two weeks,'' Filaq said. ''Along the way we will surely pass through other towns, cities of the Prophet that have known defilement by the Rus. When they see your example, your loyalty to the family of my father, that great respecter of the property and the faiths of all his peoples, they will flock to our banner. By the time we reach the capital there will be thousands sworn to the cause of restoring the true heir: Alp, my good, my wise and pious brother, that strong fighter, that wolf of our ancestors, that keeper of the law common to Jews and Muslims, whom Buljan sold to the Northmen. Thousands! Ten thousand!''''Hundreds, at least,'' the old veteran said. ''Possibly even dozens.''The wind of righteous adventure that had begun to sweep through the square subsided as this secret captain and master of the accumulated lore of soldierly skepticism began to explain that any king who controlled both the treasury and the army was, in the eyes of the world, legitimate, and that while no one could know the mind of God, the Almighty had in the past shown a marked tendency, in his view, to ratify public opinion. If the Rus had treated the towns along the coast between here and Atil as harshly as they had this poor ruin, a rebellion could hope for little to feed them along the way, let alone to swell their ranks. He had just begun to describe the torments that, he understood, awaited those convicted of mutiny when, taxed apparently by lack of food and drink and the exhaustion of the past week, his eyes rolled in their sockets, and his head tipped backward, and he slid boneless to the ground, where, fortunately for him, his skull was spared fracture by the timely action of Zelikman, who caught him and eased him to the ground, concealing the pad of wadded chamois in his fist so adroitly that Hanukkah was certain no one saw it but him.''God has silenced this man and his cowardly counsel,'' Amram said in Arabic, the mother tongue of the Arsiyah. ''Perhaps you would do well to heed this indication of his will.''There was general acclaim at this suggestion, shouts and whoops and wild ululation of the steppes, but it all ceased abruptly when Filaq pumped his fist and cried: ''Alp! Alp!''There followed a silence broken only by the wind hissing in burned rafters, the derision of a crow, somewhere the smack of the sea against stone. Then to Hanukkah's mild surprise a voice rose up and, with laconic precision, likened this rumored brother Alp to a secretion on the nether parts of a she-tur.''What is your Alp to us but a galley slave?'' he said.''If he was worth half as much as you he would have harangued and speechified those Northmen to death weeks ago,'' another said.There was laughter at this, and the soldiers felt their spirits a little restored, and little by little the square of the burned city, with its roofless mosque and its clouds of flies and its smell of death, began to resound with cries of ''Filaq! Filaq!'' that died away only when their object, having turned a shade of red deeper than the flush of sunset over the western gate of the town, ran down the steps of the mosque and fled into a side street.Next week: Filaq is the target of an assassin's knife.THE FUNNY PAGES: IIII: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.</text></article><article id="1832046"><summary>Chapter 22 of Seth's comic strip George Sprott (1894-1975)</summary><text>Chapter 22THE FUNNY PAGES: I: THE STRIP</text></article><article id="1832049"><summary>Photos of international socialites in haute-couture gowns</summary><text>The crillon ball, which takes place every November in Paris, is part debutante outing, part fashion show.

I imagine you are less celebrated back home in Tehran. No one criticizes me; no one encourages me. Nobody has anything to do with me. Those who need to know who I am know who I am.As an independent filmmaker living in a repressive Islamic theocracy, are you harassed by the government? They are very civil, but they don't allow me to screen my movies.If your films are not shown in theaters in Iran, do Iranians know of them? They can buy the DVDs on the black market.It's odd that your films would be viewed as subversive, when they're more philosophical than political and abound with picturesque views of the countryside. My favorite is ''Where Is the Friend's House?'' in which a young boy walks all night to return his friend's notebook, which he took by mistake. I don't have a favorite. When I see my old favorites, I can't even stand 10 minutes of them. Either I have changed or the movies have become old.Why are so many of your films set in cars, including ''The Taste of Cherry,'' in which a man drives around the country for the entire film, unsuccessfully asking strangers to help him commit suicide? A car is a private, personal room in motion. It's the only room when you are sitting in it; you don't have to entertain guests. I spend a lot of time in the car. I love driving. If I were not a filmmaker, I would have become a truck driver.Unlike some other Iranian artists who have fled the country, why have you decided to stay put? I like my house. The only place I sleep well is my own room in Iran.Seriously, how do artists in Iran deal with the restrictions imposed on them by the government? It makes them more creative, because art is the one positive thing they can get out of their life in Iran.What do you think of President Ahmadinejad? Do you agree with his policies? I think he doesn't do his job well. He came to power promising to solve economic problems, which he never did.As a Shiite Muslim, are you religious? It's a very private question, but if you insist, I will answer it. I am not politically religious, but I have some beliefs.Many of us in the West are confounded by the intensity of the violence between Iraq's Shiites and Sunnis, since they belong to the same faith. It's not a religious conflict. The war is not a belief war. It's an economic war. It's the result of the disproportionate division of money between the two classes of society.How do you support your filmmaking since it obviously doesn't bring in a lot at the box office? I subsidize my movies by selling my photographs. I had a show in New York at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 2000, but at the moment the U.S. has sanctions and there is not a possibility of commercial exchange.Was it hard to obtain a visa from the U.S. government for this trip? They were very kind to me; they gave me a visa. But when I arrived here, at J.F.K., I had two and a half hours of Q. and A.The U.S. government does Q. and A.'s? Not like you do. It's just to make you aware that they are watching you. They asked me: How old is your mother? How old is your father? Where do you live? I answered all the questions with pleasure.How old is your mother? My mother is 105 years old. She is very happy and very relaxed.What does she think of your films? She sleeps through them.Do you always wear sunglasses? I take them off when I shower.DEBORAH SOLOMONTHE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-11-07: QUESTIONS FOR ABBAS KIAROSTAMI</text></article><article id="1832053"><summary>William Safire on three phases now in vogue: 'age-appropriate,' 'to show ankle' and 'go figure' (M)</summary><text>Three phrases, new and old, are being bruited about the world of English. If you're not using at least one, you are letting the language pass you by.Age-AppropriateThe actor Harrison Ford, making a pitch to film critics about a forthcoming cops-and-robbers thriller, described his female lead as ''my beautiful, age-appropriate, Swedish psychic girlfriend.'' Since he is middle-aged, that would place the actress, Lena Olin, in at least her 30s or early 40s.Helen Mirren, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, strolled down the Academy Awards red carpet in what several reporters called ''a very pretty, age-appropriate dress.'' That meant that this woman ''of a certain age,'' as the French say, did not strain to look young and sexy; her d&#233;colletage was natural and decorous.The compound adjective has been around for more than a generation: the Children's Television Network designed a computer game for kids in 1982, and its spokeswoman told The Boston Globe that ''the educational concepts are age-appropriate'' (not the fiendish fun kids have today blasting monstrous space aliens to smithereens).What does the term mean? I tried it on Punch Hutton, an editor at Vanity Fair. (I think of Punch as a nickname for Arthur.) ''When you're a teenager,'' she says, ''an age-appropriate outfit means there's a little sass but nothing is too tight and there aren't any cracks -- cleavage or tush -- showing. When women get older, they don't need to show as much skin, but showing lovely shoulders and arms is feminine without being too much. No short skirts unless you're playing tennis.''A general definition, then, is ''behavior in dress, speech or action befitting one's age.'' But were that to take hold, there would go the cosmetics industry.To Show AnkleDuring the trial of Lewis (Scooter) Libby, former chief aide to Vice President Cheney, a former State Department official -- now a much-quoted critic of Iraq policy -- expressed his surprise at talk of a rift between Libby and the Bush adviser Karl Rove. ''One of their strengths,'' Lawrence Wilkerson said, ''was that they worked together. They didn't show any ankle -- it was always a team effort.''''The use of show any ankle here is confusing,'' Roger Danforth of New York e-mails. ''I'm used to it as a way of describing giving a woman's outfit a little sex appeal, or as Variety-speak ('she ankled the production') meaning 'to walk away from a movie deal.' But this is new to me. Where did it come from?''One of my Times colleagues reporting on the trial, Jim Rutenberg, who went to a Quaker school for 13 years, recalls a movie about Quakers (probably ''Friendly Persuasion'') in which ''one of the young female characters was scolded for allowing her ankles to show beneath her huge ruffled skirt. The phrase 'show a little ankle' has come up quite a bit in my interviews with political types, usually when they are weighing whether to share strategic details: 'We may be willing to show a little ankle on that eventually, but not right now.' ''A search engine went puffing back to 1984 to find a diplomatic use. Secretary of State George Shultz was meeting Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko about resuming talks on arms control. The Christian Science Monitor reported that some of the secretary's aides ''feel Mr. Shultz should show 'some ankle,' that is, suggest specific negotiating gambits that would indicate President Reagan is serious about wanting results.''John Keats in 1816 ghosted a poem for his brother George to send as a valentine to one Mary Frogley, his mouth fairly watering over ''the neatness/Of thine ankle lightly turn'd:/With those beauties, scarce discern'd. . . .''To avert 80 days in the slammer, I will now cravenly reveal a source: Lawrence Wilkerson sends word that as a 10-year-old he was ''helplessly smitten'' with a teacher: ''When she would lean to reach the blackboard . . . her longish skirt would rise and expose a lovely ankle, and all of the boys would nearly swoon. She was, however inadvertently, 'showing a little ankle.' '' In diplomatic lingo, however, such showing is intentional: the phrase means, according to Wilkerson, the witness who used it, ''to expose a bit of one's position but only enough to tease, not enough to divulge the whole matter or to give away the bigger picture.''Does that show ''a team effort'' or a rift or what? Go figure.Go figureA verbal shrug has been whipping through the language. Google reports more than two million uses in its files over the past half century, growing in intensity as the phrase has been shortened.''Go figure it out,'' Robert Stack sighed, one Erskine Johnson reported in a column that appeared in The Walla Walla Union Bulletin on June 10, 1953. ''After 'The Bullfighter and the Lady,' which was a great prestige picture, I didn't work for a year. 'Bwana Devil,' panned by everybody in Hollywood, did the trick for me.''Benjamin Zimmer, editor for American dictionaries at Oxford University Press, passed that citation around the American Dialect Society more than two years ago. He informs me that '' 'go figure' seems to have originated as a shorter form of such expressions as 'go figure it out' and 'you go figure it,' both of which date to the 1950s.'' Then shortening took place, and by the 1970s we had go figure. Now that phrase is rampant.Why has it mushroomed so? What subtleties of meaning does it express that no other phrase conveys? Or is there some other way to get across its resigned puzzlement? My e-mail address is printed at left.THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-11-07: ON LANGUAGE</text></article><article id="1832056"><summary>Jonathan Goldstein article on spending a night out with his father; drawing (M)</summary><text>My father lives in the suburbs and doesn't get out much. When he does get out, he enjoys himself. The man is certainly capable of joy. It's just that his happiness makes my mother uncomfortable. Disco-dancing at weddings, eating dessert with too much gusto, drumming on the kitchen table to a radio jingle -- they all rub her the wrong way. If my father even laughs too loudly, my mother tells him he's getting ''punchy.'' That usually quiets him down.So the other day, the first order of business was getting him out of the house. After all, it was his birthday.''Come over,'' I said to him on the phone. ''We'll go out and celebrate a little. Just me and you.''Whenever I get together with my father, I can't help seeing it as a chance to nurse him back to health. Really, all we were going to do was head downtown for a bite to eat -- my father is wonderfully easy to please. One time about 10 years ago, we took a walk to the old part of the city, and he still talks about it to this day.''Remember how hot it was?'' my father asks me every few months. ''Remember how we had to stop in to that convenience store and each of us got a soda? You got a Coke, and so did I. We drank them straight from the can -- no straw, no cup. Just like that. Like construction workers. Like street hustlers!''When he got to my house, I offered to do the driving. He got into the passenger seat, and right off the bat he said, ''Being chauffeured makes me feel like I'm on vacation.'' When he's with my mother, my father does all of the driving. My mother rides shotgun, elbows bent, pointing her house keys toward the front-door lock from 40 miles away.''What do you want to do?'' I asked.He waved a hand and told me that he didn't need pampering.Pampering! Since the mid-'80s, the man has been using the same 99-cent VHS tape to record and rerecord the same documentaries about Nazi hunting. He keeps his cuff links in a washed-out yogurt container on his dresser. One time when I was growing up, a roll of toilet paper accidentally fell in the toilet, and my mother set it to dry on the basin and forbade me to use it, referring to it as ''your father's toilet paper.''The first thing I wanted to do was find us a fancy bar. My father enjoys a drink, and at home he usually isn't able to enjoy one properly. Unfortunately, traffic was bad, and parking was even worse, so by the time we found a spot, it was 4:30, and my father was ready for supper.We debated the parking spot for a while. ''The area looks seedy,'' my father said, his voice a mix of concern and excitement. We checked and rechecked the car doors and windows, and finally, confident that the Kleenex box, empty pack of Chiclets and Chicago's ''Greatest Hits'' cassette on the dashboard were going to be safe, we were on our way.As we walked along, my father commented on everything he saw, his index fingers pointing every which way as if he were on a tour bus in Paris, or as if he were a character in a Menudo video going to a shopping mall for the first time. A panhandler! A boy with a hoop through his lip like a witch doctor! An unsavory-looking character who might be a pickpocket!After about five minutes, we came to a Middle Eastern restaurant, which, to be honest, was more of a cafeteria. We each ordered a big plate of chicken and rice, and as we ate, we drank a beer each. Beer helps my father to relax. Rather than eating hunched over as if planning a prison break, he reclined and looked around.''What kind of rice is this?'' he asked.''White,'' I said.''I'll have to ask your mother to buy some.''When we were finished eating, we went back to the car. Chicago's ''Greatest Hits'' was still on the dashboard. The afternoon had been a success.I called the house later to make sure my father had made it back O.K., and my mother answered. She said he was downstairs eating peanuts at the kitchen table. ''He had such a fabulous time with you today,'' she said, a little suspiciously. ''He can't stop talking about it.''I asked her if he enjoyed the meal we had, and she told me not to feed my father garbage. He has to watch his cholesterol. ''When's the last time you had yours checked?'' she asked.I really couldn't recall. My mother is always reminding me how her brother had a heart attack when he was about my age.After I put down the phone, I stopped to imagine, as I find myself doing lately, several times a day, what my heart attack would look like. It would be an undignified, pulling-down-the-drapes-cheeks-bulging-with-veal sort of thing. It would be the kind of heart attack that friends would laughingly imitate in the kitchen during my shiva, my mother shushing them from the other room.THE FUNNY PAGES: II: TRUE-LIFE TALES Jonathan Goldstein is the host of ''WireTap'' on CBC Radio. His last True-Life Tale was about performing feats of strength.</text></article><article id="1832066"><summary>Article on latest dance work of choreographer Matthew Bourne, Edward Scissorhands, based on Tim Burton's movie; photos (L)</summary><text>AS portrayed by Johnny Depp 17 years ago in the movie by Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands was many things to many people: a wild child, an artist, a sex symbol, a freak, a killer through little fault of his own and finally the phantom of a love long lost. As reborn in a new theater piece by Matthew Bourne, Edward is all these things and perhaps something more: the latest member of the select circle of semianimate figures who have found a lasting home in dance.A popular hit in Mr. Bourne's native England (though some critics frowned), his ''Edward Scissorhands'' is cutting a broad swath through North America, with dates in a dozen cities. On Wednesday it arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two and a half weeks, trailing raves from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and elsewhere.Mr. Bourne, 47, is the choreographer who recast Tchaikovsky's swans as bare-chested, barefoot men in fluffy pantaloons in what is said to be the longest-running ballet production in history. Since its debut in London in 1995, his ''Swan Lake'' has proved an international sensation. Arriving on Broadway in 1998 it won Mr. Bourne Tony Awards as best choreographer and best director of a musical. It is now on tour in Australia, with Moscow to follow this spring.Mr. Bourne's shows tour under the aegis of New Adventures, a company founded in 2002 to perform and tour his repertory of danced story theater. The seven productions, all evening-length, include glosses on ''The Nutcracker,'' ''Cinderella'' and ''La Sylphide'' that are witty, unabashedly sentimental and deeply informed by Mr. Bourne's childhood passion for old movies.He also provided choreography for productions of ''My Fair Lady'' and ''South Pacific'' here in London, and of ''Mary Poppins'' here and on Broadway. He dropped another project long on his agenda, ''The Little Mermaid'' (now scheduled for a Denver premiere in June, directed by Francesca Zambello, with choreography by Stephen Mear, Mr. Bourne's co-choreographer on ''Mary Poppins'').''The show was going in directions I wasn't interested in, so I pulled out,'' Mr. Bourne said in January, sitting at his kitchen table in the quietly arty neighborhood of Islington. ''I don't think I'll do many more musicals. Going to new places feels more unique, more valuable. With New Adventures I have the privilege to do anything I want, which is always the hard part. Why give that up?''''Mary Poppins'' and ''Edward Scissorhands'' each took about 10 years from conception to opening night. Now Mr. Bourne is allowing himself the leisure to think where to go next.Like Petrouchka, the rebellious, doomed puppet in Michel Fokine's ballet to Stravinsky's famous score, Edward Scissorhands is a not-quite-human being who longs to be real. Caroline Thompson, who wrote the screenplay and collaborated with Mr. Bourne on adapting it, thinks of Edward as ''an outsider who wants to be an insider,'' she said, casually likening him to Frankenstein's monster and Pinocchio. But the emotional core of Edward came from quite another source.''Edward Scissorhands was based on a beloved dog of mine,'' Ms. Thompson said after revisiting the show at the Kennedy Center in Washington. ''She was the most soulful, yearning creature I ever met. She wanted to participate in everything. She didn't need language to communicate. She communicated with her eyes.''Mr. Depp had few lines to speak. Far more memorable than any dialogue were those hands: sharp, shiny metallic hardware a foot long that quivered with unspoken emotion. By rights they should be a choreographer's nightmare.This choreographer thought otherwise. ''Rather than a hindrance, they were a blessing,'' Mr. Bourne said. ''It's easiest to work with restrictions. If you have a young girl and a young boy in love, and just go, that's hard to do. The hands create a set of problems, a sense of danger, of awkwardness. Can you lift? Can you turn? That makes it exciting.''Mr. Bourne set himself the further challenge of expressing Edward's journey through the arc of his dancing, moving from robotic pantomime to goofiness, then confidence, then operatic despair. If along the way Edward sheds his blades for a dream pas de deux backed by dancing topiary, is Mr. Bourne expanding Edward's range or just cheating?From the start of his career Mr. Bourne has created movement very much in tandem with the dancers. Between performances in Washington, Sam Archer and Richard Winsor, the two original but quite distinguishable dancing Edwards, confirmed that this method remained in force.''Matthew set us tasks,'' Mr. Winsor said, describing the early workshops, ''and we came up with steps.'' That spirit of collaboration may be one reason the pure-dance contingent views Mr. Bourne with distrust. Another might be his fondness for show and ballroom styles, which make up in energy what they lack in mystique. Early reviews of his hit shows could be scathing.''I get that less now,'' Mr. Bourne said. ''People know what I do. Someone once wrote that Matthew Bourne had made dance theater popular by taking out the dancing. Not to be pretentious about it, but for most of our audiences our shows are the most amazing dancing they've ever seen. They don't see all the ballet and modern dance the hard-core dance fans see. I do take pride in what I've made.''So it's not ''Concerto Barocco.'' Still, Mr. Bourne's skills as a storyteller -- greatly abetted by the set and costume designs of Lez Brotherston, his longtime collaborator -- can give his work remarkable resonance. What seems to strike most viewers first is Mr. Bourne's sharp social satire: those worse-than-Windsor royals of ''Swan Lake,'' the grim evangelicals of ''Edward Scissorhands.'' Repeat customers are often surprised by the ballets' romantic streak.''The elements of humor, of fun, give audiences something they need before you take them to abstract dances,'' Mr. Bourne said. ''But for me there needs to be a heartfelt psychology, something darker. That's what makes me want to work on a piece for the two or three years.''Another prime motivator for Mr. Bourne is music. The ''Edward Scissorhands'' score, by Terry Davies, preserves themes from Danny Elfman's hazily hypnotic film score and, with them, much of the movie's distinctive fairy-tale-gothic perfume. But the ballet's scenario, revised with Ms. Thompson's enthusiastic participation, adheres more to the film's spirit than to its road map.''It was good to watch the DVD with Tim Burton's commentary,'' Mr. Archer was saying when Mr. Winsor jumped in: ''The danger was to watch too much, to play a caricature of Johnny Depp, adopting his body stance rather than playing the character through my own feelings.''Ms. Thompson sees the harlequinesque Mr. Winsor (who trained in musical theater) as the ''more sensual'' and the taller, heavier-boned Mr. Archer (a ballet academy graduate) as the ''more anxious'' of the Edwards. Like Mr. Bourne she is pleased that they are not carbon copies of each other. Mr. Archer and Mr. Winsor in turn are quick to acknowledge all they have picked up from each other.''Initially we were told Sam was very strong at the comical, witty, humorous side of the part,'' Mr. Winsor said. ''There's a Fred Astaire feeling he has in Edward's drunk scenes that comes very naturally to him. I learned a lot of that from him.''Mr. Archer looked to Mr. Winsor for other things. ''At the beginning I think I was feeling a great deal but not projecting enough,'' he said. ''On film Johnny Depp could do almost nothing, and viewers could read him. But in a theater, with 2,000 people looking at you, you need the projection to be large. I learned a lot about that watching Richard, the way he projects Edward's lost feeling.''On Dec. 30 both Edwards were at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles when Mr. Depp attended a matinee of ''Edward Scissorhands'' with family and entourage. ''He visited backstage for an hour afterwards,'' said Mr. Archer, who danced that show. ''He tried on a hand, and that was quite surreal. He said he doesn't watch his films, so this was the first time he had seen the story in 16 years. He said it was lovely to see it taken in a different direction.''Days later, in London, Mr. Bourne received a souvenir program from Los Angeles with an inscription that read in part, ''Trembled on the verge of tears, mate.'' It was signed Johnny Depp.Edward Scissorhands  BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC  30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Wednesday to March 31, (718) 636-4100; bam.org.DANCECorrection:  March 18, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the dance-theater work ''Edward Scissorhands'' transposed the physical descriptions and backgrounds of the two men who alternate in the title role.

A kind of universal quality control seems to be at work, gradually editing out the less-than-memorable and holding on to what we ought to keep in mind. Isaac Alb&#233;niz may be an exception, although as more contemporary pianists come to grips with the physical difficulties of his ''Iberia,'' Alb&#233;niz is edging into the public consciousness.A good thing. He had the generosity of Liszt, the kaleidoscopic ear of Ravel and a melodic gift that compares well to Schumann's. And as a Spaniard surrounded by some of the most vivid folk and popular music ever devised, Alb&#233;niz kept his ear to the ground. Dvorak and Smetana were doing the same thing in Central Europe.Like Schumann, Alb&#233;niz thought opera was the way to fame, fortune and posterity, but unlike his German predecessor, he actually wrote a handful of them. ''Pepita Jim&#233;nez,'' resurrected in a two-CD Deutsche Grammophon recording starring Pl&#225;cido Domingo, may be the one to listen to, if only because it is available. You may be startled to find the text in English, even more startled to know that English is its original language. Alb&#233;niz's rich English patron aspired to libretto writing, of which this is an example.Spanish opera never set its sights high. In ambition, Falla's ''Vida Breve'' is a cut above the lighthearted, light-footed zarzuela, a form of operetta with spoken dialogue much like the singspiel or the Broadway musical. There is also ''Goyescas,'' an operafied afterthought to Granados's piano suite of that name. But Romantic Spain never found its ''Tristan und Isolde.'' The closest Spanish music has ever come to Wagnerian darkness may be the long and declamatory ''Amor y la Muerta'' in the piano original of ''Goyescas.''''Pepita Jim&#233;nez'' is no ''Tristan'' either, although it shows Alb&#233;niz's wonderful synthesis of Spanish dance music and a command of orchestra writing not often attributed to him. In a story from a popular novel of the time, father and son compete for the rich widow of the opera's title. Further conflict is provided by the son's status as young seminarian.Surviving a maze of revisions by the composer beginning immediately after the premiere in 1896 -- as well as translations into Spanish, German and French -- is the idea that in this opera the son (Don Luis) and Pepita find each other in the end. After a rediscovery of sorts in 1964, later editors decided that our heroine is a suicide at the final curtain. The version for this recording, by Jos&#233; De Eusebio, leaves the happy-ending-versus-tragedy question up to the listener.Mr. De Eusebio conducts the Orquesta y Coro de la Comunidad de Madrid to good effect. Carol Vaness, in the title role, is tortured by the part's high tessitura and elsewhere not always in tune. Enrique Baquerizo's modestly bellowing baritone is not lovely but may fit the aging-suitor personality of Don Pedro. Mr. Domingo's tenor, on the other hand, sounds absolutely terrific. His elegant Don Luis is like a luxurious oasis in an otherwise not-well-watered cast.</text></article><article id="1832076"><summary>Article on Max Ophuls's 1953 romantic film The Earrings of Madame de; photo (M)</summary><text>FOR years, every time I saw Max Oph&#252;ls's romantic masterpiece of 1953, ''The Earrings of Madame de ,'' the film left me with the nagging impression that it was based on some minor classic of late 19th-century or early 20th-century European literature that I had shamefully neglected to read. Surely it would be found on the shelf with Guy de Maupassant (''Le Plaisir''), Arthur Schnitzler (''La Ronde'') and Stefan Zweig (''Letter From an Unknown Woman''), the great and subtle ironists from whom Oph&#252;ls drew some of his most enduring work.As it turns out, ''Madame de'' is a slim novella of no great literary distinction. And ''Madame de'' is what it was called when the book was published in 1951, the ellipsis having been added by Oph&#252;ls and the ''Earrings of'' by the film's English-language distributor. (''The Earrings of Madame de ,'' in a new 35-millimeter print, will open at Film Forum on Friday.)Filling a slight 62 pages in its Folio paperback edition, ''Madame de'' is a sketchy fiction set in no particular time and no particular place, about three people with no particular names. Monsieur de (his last name is abridged to create the impression dear to 19th-century novelists that the characters are based on real people) is a well-to-do gentleman with a vague interest in matters military and a beautiful wife, the most elegant and most empty of women, whose casual flirtations and childish deceptions he has long since learned to forgive. But when Madame de finds that her infatuation with an ambassador has stirred in her some deep, unfamiliar feelings, Monsieur de realizes that something serious has occurred and ensures, in the most final manner, that the liaison is broken off.In the novel Madame de has no first name. In the film she is called Louise, almost certainly a reference to Louise de Vilmorin, the author of ''Madame de'' and a celebrated beauty in her own right. The daughter of a prosperous furniture manufacturer, she was engaged to Antoine de Saint-Exup&#233;ry in her youth, drifted through a couple of aristocratic husbands and in her later years was the mistress of Andr&#233; Malraux.Photographs taken by Cecil Beaton show her in the company of Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier: a small, round-faced, impeccably turned out woman, posing in grand rooms filled with bibelots and baroque furniture that doubtless would have pleased Madame de herself. Oph&#252;ls was a member of her Sunday evening salon, as were Jean Cocteau, Ana&#239;s Nin, Paul Meurisse, Roland Petit and L&#233;o Ferr&#233;. ''Madame de,'' as Oph&#252;ls must have realized, is very likely in part a self-portrait.Oph&#252;ls may well have turned to his friend's novel when his long-planned project about another coquettish aristocrat redeemed by love, based on ''La Duchesse de Langeais,'' the 1839 story by Honor&#233; de Balzac, collapsed. (It was to have starred Greta Garbo. A screen test of Garbo in the role survives, her last professional appearance before a camera.)''Madame de'' reads almost like a proposal for an Oph&#252;ls film, with most of the major plot points sketched out and the symmetrical structure already established. (The book, like the film, is constructed around a pair of earrings that pass from hand to hand, lover to lover, always returning to the family jeweler, who obligingly sells them again and again to Monsieur de.) But few of the details are there, and it is precisely in the difference between ''Madame de'' and ''Madame de '' that all the genius of Oph&#252;ls can be found.''Our marriage is only superficially superficial,'' says Monsieur de, played by Charles Boyer (in his first French film since before the war), as he gingerly approaches the subject of her new lover with his flighty, distracted wife. She, of course, has become Danielle Darrieux, one of the most glorious assets of the French cinema.A star since the early 1930s, usually playing romantic young innocents (her international breakthrough was as Marie Vetsera opposite Boyer's Archduke Rudolph in Anatole Litvak's ''Mayerling'' in 1936), Ms. Darrieux had sat out the Occupation and returned to films only in 1946, with a maturity and melancholy hidden behind her perfect features. She too is ''only superficially superficial,'' as she discovers to her own surprise when her affection for the ambassador, now named Donati and played by Italy's polished leading man, Vittorio De Sica, develops into a passion that threatens to destroy the indulgent life to which she has become accustomed.For audiences of 1953 the presence of these three maturing stars (De Sica had also begun as an actor in the early '30s and earned his postwar gravitas as the director of ''Shoeshine'' and ''Bicycle Thieves'') must have already created a sense of time passed and opportunities lost. By setting the film in the late 1890s or early 1900s (there is no specific time frame given in the novel), Oph&#252;ls casts the action even further into the past, to that moment of relative peace and prosperity before the royal suicides at Mayerling were followed by the assassinations in Saravejo and, in the words of the historian Ludwig Reiners, ''the lamps went out in Europe'' as World War I exploded.For all the affection Oph&#252;ls demonstrated for the period the French call la belle &#233;poque -- and particularly for the life in the Vienna of Emperor Franz Joseph in films like ''Letter From an Unknown Woman'' and ''La Ronde'' -- he had no material connection to it. He was born Max Oppenheimer to a wealthy Jewish family in the textile trade, in the German industrial town of Saarbr&#252;cken near the French border. According to Claude Beylie, one of his biographers, Oph&#252;ls spent only a few months in Austria during the period of his early success as a young theater director, and didn't much care for it.The Paris of ''Madame de '' is finally no more real than the Vienna of Oph&#252;ls's other films, which it resembles to the point of identification. This is a world of Oph&#252;ls's imagining: an artificial world, filled with extraordinary objects, ruled by a strict code of decorum and lived through ritual gestures and ingrained manners. It belongs to a time when appearance was everything, when the surface was more significant than what it disguised, that time before a true Viennese, Sigmund Freud, threw open the doors and let the secrets out.As Oph&#252;ls's famously restless camera swirls through ''Madame de ,'' from the crowded and lively allegro passages of the first act to the desolate adagio of the third, he traces an interior journey, from a world of bright, enchanting surfaces to the dim recesses of a soul. Madame de is ennobled as her girlish infatuation grows into an emotion that she can't control and that finally consumes her.In the end nothing remains of Madame de except for the pair of earrings -- diamonds cut in the shape of a heart -- which she leaves behind as an offering in a dank neighborhood church. But as Oph&#252;ls's camera closes in on them, moving across the empty church to the glass case that contains them, marked with a silver plaque with her name, we see the diamonds have become her: glittering, transparent, icily beautiful, they are now illuminated by a flickering candle, a trembling spirit that nothing can erase. This ending, one of the most beautiful in the movies, has no parallel in Louise de Vilmorin's novel. It is entirely Oph&#252;ls's own, and it contains the essence of his art.FILMCorrection:  March 18, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about ''The Earrings of Madame de ,'' a film based on a novel by Louise de Vilmorin, referred incorrectly to the writer's father. He was a botanist who helped run the French horticultural house Vilmorin-Andrieux; he was not a furniture manufacturer. Also, the article referred incorrectly to the career of Danielle Darrieux, one of the stars of the film. She appeared in a few films during World War II; she did not sit out the Occupation.</text></article><article id="1832084"><summary>Nate Chinen reviews five new CDs; photos (M)</summary><text>D&#228;lekOminous, furious and humorless: those are a few adjectives you could pin on D&#228;lek, the underground hip-hop group from Newark. The group's new album, ''Abandoned Language'' (Ipecac), is a characteristically dark effort and a typically strong one. The only rapper on the album is d&#228;lek -- lowercase, to distinguish him from the group -- and he sustains a brooding, apocalyptic intensity throughout. One minute into the first track he plants this mood in a context: ''From the scorching country fields to the heart of projects/What we know of history's always marred in violence.'' Then comes a declaration of faith in the revolutionary power of speech, though it's tempered with wary cynicism. Surrounding d&#228;lek's words, and eventually swallowing them, is an ambient wash produced by Oktopus and Joshua Booth. That queasy industrial thrum, supplemented by the turntable scribbles of Motiv and Rob Swift, marks ''Abandoned Language'' as a sonic descendant of ''Loveless,'' the 1991 alternative-rock epic by My Bloody Valentine. But D&#228;lek, or at least d&#228;lek, has ambitions beyond stylish dissonance. So when this album's atmosphere stifles its subversive wordplay, there's no sense of blissful fulfillment -- just more rage.ShiningLike some other good young Norwegian bands, Shining traffics in archly stylized genre bafflement. On ''Grindstone'' (Rune Grammofon), the group's fourth album, that impulse yields a jarring but meticulous quasi suite, informed by sources ranging from Franz Schubert to the thrash metal of Sepultura to the soundtrack scramble of John Zorn's Naked City. It's attention-deficit music, jumpy and spasmodic, but it doesn't shy from any species of grandeur. Jorgen Munkeby, who mainly plays guitar and saxophone, leads the group with brazen confidence, and his three band mates decisively match his frenzy. The finishing touches come courtesy of the engineer and producer Kare Chr. Vestrheim, and they're most obvious early on, in the delirious transition from ''Winterreise'' to ''Stalemate Longan Runner.'' It's a completely over-the-top stretch of music, and that seems to be the point.Rosie ThomasUnnerved by the aboveground production of her last album, the Seattle-based singer-songwriter Rosie Thomas decided to record some new music in the bedrooms and kitchens of her friends. ''These Friends of Mine,'' on her new label imprint, Sing-a-long, is the charmingly scattershot result. Of course it might have been more scattered and less charming if Ms. Thomas had friends other than Sufjan Stevens, Denison Witmer and Josh Myers, all capable strummers and singers; don't begrudge her good connections. And don't fault her for covering love songs by R.E.M. and Fleetwood Mac, though her sweet-tempered voice sounds better on a custom-made confessional like ''I Have Much Further to Go.'' At a mere 33 minutes ''These Friends of Mine'' doesn't overstay its welcome, though its dreaminess can still grow cloying, as when ''Kite Song'' arrives on the heels of ''Paper Doll.'' What saves the album is a genuine sense of intimacy, along with a stealthy proficiency. With friends like these, who needs a band?Abram WilsonIn the self-defined subgenre known as black British jazz, few musicians have shown more promise or received more recognition than the trumpeter Abram Wilson. A Londoner for only the last five years, Mr. Wilson grew up in New Orleans, an experience that clearly informs his second album, ''Ride! Ferris Wheel to the Modern Day Delta'' (Dune). Employing a sextet, a blues trio and a group he calls the Londorleans Brass Band, Mr. Wilson has produced a kind of jazz opera, complete with characters and a plot. (In short: A young trumpeter abandons the family business, a jazz club, in favor of a hip-hop-influenced brass outfit. Uh-oh.) The hero, portrayed without strain by Mr. Wilson, announces his intentions in an overture called ''I Want More for Me Than This.'' The album improves as it progresses, but with an elephant in the room: Wynton Marsalis, a still-too-obvious influence on Mr. Wilson as both a trumpeter and a composer. Could the album's symbolic patriarch be a stand-in for Mr. Marsalis? Listen to some of Mr. Wilson's solos -- start with ''Why You Guys Laughin'?'' -- and decide for yourself.Frank FosterThirty years ago next October, the tenor saxophonist Frank Foster and the drummer Elvin Jones brought their Loud Minority Big Band into a New York studio, recording enough material for an album. For various reasons that album was never released, and the master tapes went into storage. They have now been recovered, restored and newly issued as ''Well Water'' (Piadrum), a portrait of a sure-footed band during a transitional moment in jazz culture. Mr. Foster, who would later assume full leadership and stewardship of the Loud Minority, applies his formidable arranging skills to six songs, including three of his own. (One halfhearted original, with a jazz-rock groove that Mr. Foster disdainfully describes in the liner notes as ''un-swing,'' reflects some of the era's tensions.) Several of the band's members make memorable solo contributions, none more so than the alto saxophone lead by C. I. Williams on ''There'll Be a Time.'' That is, unless you count the drumming of Mr. Jones, an unmistakable force even in this setting, with so many other forces at play.

The basic themes remain the same, but experimentation and personal development yield different nuances.The Lenz wines tasted last month are uniformly subtle, restrained and graceful. They make it clear that Mr. Fry cares deeply about what he is doing.A French influence dominates Lenz's palate. Take the 2004 gew&#252;rztraminer ($19.99). Aromatic, awash in litchi and grapefruit character, this young, spicy, bone-dry white easily outstrips many competing versions from Alsace, which have been Lenz's inspiration since its first gew&#252;rztraminer was released in 1983. Before winter escapes, this savory wine should be poured with a steaming platter of Alsatian-style choucroute garnie.Burgundy in the minimal-oak M&#226;con genre speaks through Mr. Fry's perfumed 2004 White Label chardonnay ($11.99). If any fairly simple chardonnay fits two tableside descriptions beloved of sommeliers -- ''versatile'' and ''food-friendly'' -- it is this one. The chardonnay's virtually crackling crispness brings to mind Granny Smith apples and kiwis.A fancier Burgundy inspiration turns up in the 2004 Old Vines chardonnay ($24.99), a new label at Lenz. Fermentation and maturation in French oak barrels result in a rounded, creamy texture and in punchy flavors like buttered popcorn, dried pineapples, pears, fig and traces of coconut.In a blind tasting, Mr. Fry's 2001 Old Vines cabernet sauvignon ($35) could easily be confused with its counterpart from the M&#233;doc region of Bordeaux; likewise, the 2001 Old Vines merlot ($55) might be mistaken for a St.-&#201;milion.The easygoing, supple cabernet, fully matured, delivers a m&#233;lange of aromas and flavors: tobacco, pencil shavings, herbs, tar and jam. In the fairly simple, quaffable merlot, consumers will taste black currant (or cassis) and beets. It helped that 2001 was a terrific growing season on the North Fork.LONG ISLAND VINES</text></article><article id="1832099"><summary>Joanne Starkey reviews Cooperage Inn restaurant in Baiting Hollow, NY; photos (M)</summary><text>SOME restaurants are worlds unto themselves, while others reflect their communities. The Cooperage Inn is a mirror of Baiting Hollow, a still-rural hamlet just north and west of Riverhead where large new homes have been popping up in former potato fields.The menu at the Cooperage Inn also mixes old and new: traditional favorites like chicken pot pie and meatloaf share the menu with more contemporary fare like cedar-planked salmon and tuna carpaccio Asian style.The d&#233;cor at this sprawling spot is country-cute, with flower-sprigged carpeting and floral and lace swags at the windows. The Harvest Room, with its stone fireplace, is the dining room of choice. Here the look runs to pictures of roosters, a giant wreath over the fireplace, carved wooden animals, rustic pots and a wooden hobby horse. The Vineyard Room, decked out in vines and pictures of grapes, reflects the expanding local wine industry.The Cooperage Inn is a popular spot; even on a Monday there was a decent crowd. The restaurant lures patrons with buffet nights, early-bird specials and other deals. Though we didn't try the Friday night buffet ($25, but scheduled to end on April 27), it looked good, and it contained many of the specials offered that evening.The menu is diverse, and the quality of the food is scattershot, too. Two appetizers were startlingly good. The shrimp cocktail held four firm shrimp that were among the largest I have ever seen. Equally fine -- and half the price -- was the seafood bisque, chunky and creamy with a deep, briny flavor.Skip the baked clams, which contained more bread than seafood. The crab cakes, though tasty, also suffered from an excess of filler. The appetizer tower for two ($16.50) was a three-tiered extravaganza, which included those bready clams and crab cakes; a sesame-chicken spring roll with a sweet chili emulsion; a small bean sprout salad with peanut sauce; tuna carpaccio rolled in black pepper; a clump of seaweed salad; and a small mound of Asian peanut noodles.Every entree comes with a small, forgettable garden salad; the creamy blue cheese dressing was the best of those offered. The Caesar salad, which was entree size and carried an entree price ($13.50), added toasted almonds, roasted red peppers and capers to the classic ingredients. The sesame-crusted calamari salad was another meal-size choice. Its mustard-soy vinaigrette was snappy, but some of the seafood was rubbery.The entree I would go back for is the slab of very tender and tasty barbecued baby back ribs. Forget the tough grilled pork chops, the overly breaded stuffed shrimp scampi and the overcooked, honey-roasted cedar-planked salmon. Sesame-seared yellowfin tuna was a better bet. Cooked medium rare as ordered, it arrived atop wasabi mashed potatoes and saut&#233;ed spinach with a garnish of pickled ginger.Two other winning dishes were the 35-ounce marinated porterhouse steak, crowned with caramelized garlic and shallots, and chicken Tuscano, a layering of saut&#233;ed chicken, prosciutto, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts and spinach in a port wine demi-glace under a mantle of melted mozzarella.Desserts are house made and as uneven as the rest of the menu. We gave thumbs up to the warm flourless chocolate cake, the tangy Key lime pie and the rich coconut cream pie. The cheesecakes -- flavors change frequently -- were too dense and not nearly creamy enough. The Cooperage Inn's version of s'mores was a sticky-sweet mound of chocolate-coated graham crackers sitting in a pool of chocolate syrup and gooey caramel sauce, all covered with melted marshmallow. Even the homemade ice creams were inconsistent. The trio of flavors one night included a delicious velvet chocolate, a too-icy coffee and a dull butter pecan, notable only for the quantity of nuts it contained.Cooperage Inn2218 Sound Avenue  Baiting Hollow  (631) 727-8994  cooperageinn.comGOODTHE SPACE -- Sprawling restaurant with country-cute d&#233;cor.

But instead of harping on the negative, they have chosen to create alternative vistas and futuristic make-believe environments using a wide range of image creation and manipulation techniques.Digital media abounds, with its infinite possibilities for image enhancement and manipulation, especially when it comes to new forms of landscape art. Dan Torop, for example, has created a computer program for an artificial landscape that visitors to the gallery can enter and then manipulate with a joystick. The shape of the moon, the volume and density of rain, even the color and height of land masses can be changed with the press of a button.It's an interesting work, yet I have reservations about it: no matter how much time you devote to building the perfect landscape, with fine weather, even an island all to yourself, it is almost impossible to feel at home in this shifting, anonymous universe. You are alone in there, and the constrained movement of the joystick reflects the limits of human interaction with the brave new digital world, which in the end can seem like little more than just hollow decoration.While Mr. Torop's computer-generated landscape allows us to play God for a few moments, Oliver Warden takes us to the limits of the ever-expanding digital universe. His photographs, collectively titled ''The Edge of the World,'' depict the final frames or edges of the virtual landscapes inside computer games; more specifically, he captures and enlarges images of the areas on the edge of the gaming grid. He invites us to imagine what comes next.Other artists depict the natural world in a more straightforward manner, though always as a constructed reality. Karen Azoulay's installation ''The Evening Canopy and the Sunset Hour'' (2006) creates the impression of a twilight sky, the artist filling a fabric-covered enclosure with thousands of loops of hand-dyed string hung from wooden slats by hue from dark to light. Though not as compelling as a lot of other work here, it is still surprisingly soulful.Besides Ms. Azoulay, several other artists in the exhibition employ materials and techniques associated more with craft than with art. An example is Rowena Dring, whose works look from a distance like monumental paintings of generic landscape subjects, like streams, mountains, beaches and forests, but which up close are revealed to be dense, detailed compositions of stitched fabric. Here real places become the starting point for constructed, fictitious ones.Jude Miller's simple, enigmatic sculptures are crepe paper replicas of flowers collected on her travels. Beautiful and intricately crafted, they repay close scrutiny and patient appreciation, without which much of their delicacy is easily overlooked; her reproductions or facsimiles of nature are so good that they are almost indistinguishable from the originals. The synthetic and artificial seamlessly take the place of reality.It is interesting to note, finally, that the exhibition's curator, Joseph R. Wolin, has chosen landscape imagery devoid of people. There is not a single person depicted in the more than 30 artworks here, with the exception of a mysterious, obscured figure floating silently downward in water in Adam Shecter's video installation, which is ominously titled ''Ghosts'' (2006). This work feels like a warning -- a nod to Mr. Gore's film and the increasingly uncertain future of our planet.''Landescapism,'' Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip, through March 25.

My twin brother, Bill, and I were the lucky tasters. We decided which batches were the lightest, chewiest, best. It was as if we had formed a small, secret club that met from June to September whenever my father was at work. Ma was trying to win the grand prize ($25,000 at the time) in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. And we believed she would.On summer weekdays, to free up time for baking, she established a solid routine. Bill and I watched an ''I Love Lucy'' rerun, ate breakfast and went outside, the screen door locked behind us. We had the run of a patio, an above-ground swimming pool and a clubhouse fashioned from an old pup tent. We could return for a bathroom break, if absolutely necessary, but my mother didn't discourage going in the bushes. We ate our lunch al fresco and Ma always served homemade lemonade.''No need to come inside,'' she would say. ''It's summer'' -- although she herself rarely ventured outside the air-conditioned house. My father always told us, ''Your mother is an indoor girl.''After we passed two more summers this way, and she twice more entered her recipe, Ma gave up. She was sorry she had wasted so much time on a contest. She never won anything anyway, she said. By then, my brother and I were 13. We hated the bake-off people and believed the contest was rigged.My mother, however, shook off the rejection and continued to bake for many years, setting to work on ''blitzentorte'' and struffoli and pecan pie with bourbon. She was so prolific, in fact, that when she didn't produce dessert for a few days in a row, we knew something was wrong.In 2004, she suffered a stroke that led to complications and landed her in the hospital for weeks. Yet, even then, when we finally took her home, what she most wanted to do was get back to her pans, her mixing bowls and her stove.Propped up in the hospital bed I had ordered from a medical supply warehouse, she pointed toward the kitchen. ''I want to go in there,'' she said, searching for the word to describe her favorite room in the house. ''I want to make my cookies.''I knew immediately which ones she meant. I offered to bake some Bohemians myself.''Until you feel better, let me at least try,'' I said. I would do anything to spark an interest in food, as my once robust mother seemed to be shrinking daily. Ma always enjoyed baking more than eating, I knew, but she agreed.''I'll give you the recipe,'' she said.''No, no, no, Ma. You already gave it to me.''I had, in fact, been stealing Ma's recipe cards, one by one, from her kitchen cabinets since the stroke. I hid the cards in my pocketbook, in shopping bags, in my coat, afraid that my father or my brother might catch me taking something they wanted too.Ma had kept copies of the Bohemian recipe because so many people had asked for it. It directed the baker to roll the dough, whip egg whites into a meringue, add chopped chocolate chips and nuts, wrap the dough around the meringue, bake, slice and dust with confectioner's sugar. ''Anyone can make these!'' my mother wrote next to an asterisk, willing success on all comers.But a few years before my mother got sick I approached Bohemians on my own and discovered that anyone could not make these. It was 2001 and I had a full-time job, a baby daughter who was awake all night and asleep all day, and a fast and wily 3-year-old son. When the digital timer on the oven beeped, a dry, brown patch sat crumbling on the cookie tray. Of course, I was an inexperienced baker working in a brain fog, but there was another reason for this poor result. As I proofed yeast, separated eggs, whipped meringue and rolled out pastry dough -- what chefs call technique -- I understood. The judges had ignored Ma because, asterisk or no, her cookies were pretty hard to make, and I believe easy was a bake-off requirement.I had called my mother. ''I'm done with baking,'' I said. ''I'm so very tired. Your cookies are impossible.'' I never said the bake-off judges were right, but I was thinking it.My mother was a spry 77 years old then, still clipping recipes out of women's magazines and patiently improving them. She told me to get some rest and to try again. The yeast was probably old. (Wait, had I put any in?)Three years later, I did try again, only because my ailing mother couldn't. Every morning, before anyone in the neighborhood turned on the lights, when I really should have been dressing for work, I tried.I had entered my own personal bake-off, and time was running out. I baked for my children. I secretly hoped they'd band with me, and that we could form our own small club. I imagined them voting on which cookies were lightest, chewiest, best -- but they refused a taste. They ate only the cookies they saw advertised on television.My husband ate some of the experiments, but even he couldn't eat them all. I offered some to mothers watching their children play in the cul-de-sac. I served them to the plumber. I volunteered them at school.The cookies hit big. One of my friends said: ''You're wasting your time in the corporate world. You should bake for a living.'' No one asked for the recipe.I took the best batch to my mother. Gloria, the home health aide, clucked and glared at me from her post at the opposite end of the room. My mother was allowed only applesauce and mashed bananas. ''You know, you shouldn't be giving your mama something like that,'' Gloria said. ''She's gonna choke, and then what?''I turned my back to Gloria, broke off a tiny corner and put it between my mother's lips. She chewed and swallowed and sipped water through a straw. She rested between bites.Then she stopped eating and smiled and looked up at me. In that moment, she didn't quite recognize me. I might as well have been just another visiting nurse or physical therapist assigned to her case. It had happened before, but I always wondered where she went.''How did you find this recipe, dear?'' she asked. ''You know, I made Bohemians for years and years. Not just anyone can make these.''GENERATIONS</text></article><article id="1832114"><summary>Correction of Mar 4 article about Rough Beauty, photography book about Vidor, Tex (S)</summary><text>An article last Sunday about a book of photographs of Vidor, Tex., incorrectly referred to a killing as part of the town's legacy of racism.

The latest example is BlackStones Steakhouse, which opened eight months ago in Norwalk. In looks, this newcomer resembles some of the classic old steakhouses, with a dark interior and gaslight-style overhead fixtures. Dinner prices, too, are steakhouse standard, ranging from $30.95 to $34.95 for beef, veal and lamb entrees. Portions are monster-large; again, that seems par. And though potatoes and a vegetable accompany almost all lunch entrees, the only gratis items at dinner are the butter and commercial-tasting rolls. As at many similar venues, all vegetables and other dinner ''sides'' are extra, priced from $5.95 to $6.95 (but, it should be noted, big enough for at least two -- a delicious bowl of creamed spinach actually served four of us, as did the saut&#233;ed mushrooms).What is less traditional about this steakhouse is that there are almost as many seafood entrees as red meat ones -- I almost had to browbeat my three guests into ordering steak. As it turned out, the best entree we ordered was the filet mignon, a beautifully seared piece of beef cooked exactly as ordered: medium rare. The steak au blue was another fine slab of beef, a certified Angus New York strip steak with an unnecessary scoop of blue cheese on top. At lunch the grilled veal chop was equally high quality and humongous.Most problematical of our entrees was my supposedly sesame-encrusted Ahi tuna. When the fish arrived, it was missing any adornment. I mentioned this to our waiter, who whisked it back to the kitchen. Ten minutes later the fish reappeared, not encrusted as promised on the menu, but with a few black and white sesame seeds sprinkled over the top and a mound of wasabi beside it. The fish was perfectly done -- sushi-rare -- and of excellent quality; unfortunately, it was stone cold.The best of our fish dishes was Dover sole, expertly deboned and served in a piquant lemon beurre blanc with capers. A salmon filet, in a similar treatment, should have been just as tasty if more assertive, but it was oddly bland.As for our various starters, I liked the two little ''golf balls'' of crusted goat cheese that were hidden in my tossed salad of baby greens, but the greens themselves were soggy, drenched in balsamic vinaigrette, and the garlic cro&#251;tes mentioned on the menu, which might have helped absorb the excess oil and vinegar, were missing. A mixed greens salad also suffered from an overdose of vinegar.The crisp, cheese-rich Caesar salad was a much better choice, as was a fresh mozzarella and tomato salad that came with a marinated whole portobello cap and grilled zucchini. Other appealing appetizer choices were the velvety lobster bisque and the grilled portobello mushroom cap with Gorgonzola gratin&#233;e. At lunch, we enjoyed two satisfying sandwiches: grilled chicken with lettuce, tomato and a slice of fresh mozzarella, and a gargantuan steak sandwich with saut&#233;ed onions, peppers and melted American cheese -- both served on grilled thick and crusty bread.Desserts were minimal, and not made on the premises. The best of three cakes was the creamy cheesecake. Both the carrot cake and chocolate cake tasted commercial, and were punctuated with peaks of canister whipped cream. Best to stick with the lemon sorbet (tucked into a whole frozen lemon) or the chocolatey tartuffo.BlackStones Steakhouse181 Main Street  Norwalk  (203) 840-902  www.181blackstonesteakhouse.comSATISFACTORYTHE SPACE -- A long, rather gloomy storefront, with wood wainscoting, dark red walls, gaslight-type overhead light fixtures, wooden floor.

I miss my fair weather Sundays driving up Route 7 a bit after sunrise, with coffee and a Mahalia Jackson CD to effect full, upbeat reveille.When I go, I like to arrive early at the Elephant's Trunk Flea Market in New Milford. But I'm not competitive enough to join the predawn patrol of early birds and ravenous dealers. Let them get the killer bargains; I'm content with a good walk amid the stalls in the still-dewy former alfalfa field, a steaming egg-and-cheese sandwich from the rickety breakfast trailer and some quality time with my teenage daughter, whom I've trained to freeze like a pointer when she spots some of ''Mom's favorite green'' pottery.The Trunk, as it is known, is a family affair for us and the hundreds of other nuclear and extended clans I see there. Invariably, we meet up with my brother; he is an itinerant antiques and militaria dealer and one of the unofficial mayors of the mart. Sometimes we pick up my sister on the way.As we schmooze and browse en famille, talismans of our wonder years turn up. We found our insanely grinning Woolworth's cookie jar, now going for $85. We passed. But for a buck, we pounced on a replacement for the kitschy ''Gourmet Spoon Rest'' that sat on Mom's stove for decades. Shared memory meanders with us between the tables. And when we break to sit and share the egg sandwiches, there is another, unseen presence amid our knapsacks: our late dad, Lord of the Fleas.To him, heaven was a tag sale with an ''anything here for 25 cents'' blanket. He prowled fleas and yard sales from Stamford to Stratford, hit the Bridgeport junk shops on his lunch hour, and of course, plied the Trunk. When we children scouted with him, we usually kept an aisle away, so mortifyingly theatrical was his bargaining style. We sent him to his rest with his beloved 50-cent transistor radio and a jar of his ubiquitous green touch-up paint tucked inside his coffin.The three of us have inherited the itch in varying degrees: My brother has found Confederate sabers, repatriated a samurai sword to Japan, and lives in an overstuffed farmhouse that would spook the Collyer brothers. My sister is a desultory hunter of ''smalls.'' We have learned to walk briskly away when she spots a button vendor. I am my father's daughter: cheap. This has made me a serial repurposer of the chairs, tables, pie safes and oddments that make our crooked little house a home.For the last couple of seasons, there have been dark rumors about the imminent demise of the Trunk, which began with 15 dealers in 1976 and can now accommodate more than 800 cars and 475 vendors. The sprawling Woodbury flea just to the east is being bulldozed for a shopping mall within the year. Could the Trunk be next? Surrounding land prices have leapt as Route 7 morphs into a widened straightaway clotted with condos and big-box stores from a sleepy two-lane of farm stands and cornfields.It would be a shame. The Sunday flea, with its $1 admission, is one of the last refuges of cheap, multigenerational family fun. I got up my nerve and called Greg Baecker, who has managed the 55-acre Trunk enterprise for its owner, Roy Young, since the beginning. He, too, has noticed a change in pace.''It used to be a leisurely thing people did after church,'' Mr. Baecker said. ''Now some people charge onto the field at 6, and by 11 their finds are digitally photographed and up on eBay.'' But, he reassured me, the Trunk is rock solid: ''We fully intend to run a flea market here for the next 10 to 20 years. Then, as Roy says, we'll let our grandchildren decide what to do with it.''The Trunk will open April 1, weather permitting. Before it's time to shoo the wintering field mice from my trusty flea kit -- a trash bag stuffed with rope and old blankets for transporting fragile finds -- I will do penance for last season's indulgences. As the winter winds still howl, I am restoring mirrors, matting old prints of exotic chicken species and shoring up $3 chairs with clamps and Gorilla Glue.And I will get around to framing a high school portrait of my dad, circa 1940, handsome, smiling and not yet thinking of war. After seasons of searching, I have found the perfect frame -- solid, well turned and only slightly distressed. I only need to hunt up the right piece of glass. As I ease in the glazier's points, I'll invoke our clan motto: Check this out, Daddy. I found it at the flea.E-mail: conn@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1832137"><summary>Editorial opposes $1 surcharge on one-way Metro-North tickets, scheduled to start in 2008, that is supposed to help pay for new trains</summary><text>The more closely people examine the $1 surcharge on one-way Metro-North tickets that is scheduled to start next year, the shakier it looks.The surcharge was supposed to help pay for new Metro-North trains. Two years ago the provision was tucked in the huge transportation bill and was subject to an up-or-down vote. Fairfield County lawmakers voted for the bill despite misgivings about the surcharge.Yet the tax is counterproductive. It would be imposed long before the new rail cars are ready to roll. In addition, when the $1 fee is imposed on short excursions, such as the $3.50 peak-hour trip between Stamford and Bridgeport, it represents an unacceptably high percentage of the entire cost. Finally, neither the governor's budget office nor the Department of Transportation has clear answers as to how much the tax would add to monthly Metro-North tickets.The bottom line is this: the fee is far too high and will discourage people from taking the train. We hope that Senator Andrew McDonald, a Democrat who represents Stamford and Darien, is successful in his search for an alternative.Connecticut</text></article><article id="1832139"><summary>Carol Veccione Generations essay on memories of her mother baking Bohemian cookies and her own attempts to duplicate them; drawing (M)</summary><text>MY mother spent the summer of 1971 testing every variation on Bohemians, pastrylike cookies that she made with walnuts or pecans or no nuts at all. My twin brother, Bill, and I were the lucky tasters. We decided which batches were the lightest, chewiest, best. It was as if we had formed a small, secret club that met from June to September whenever my father was at work. Ma was trying to win the grand prize ($25,000 at the time) in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. And we believed she would.On summer weekdays, to free up time for baking, she established a solid routine. Bill and I watched an ''I Love Lucy'' rerun, ate breakfast and went outside, the screen door locked behind us. We had the run of a patio, an above-ground swimming pool and a clubhouse fashioned from an old pup tent. We could return for a bathroom break, if absolutely necessary, but my mother didn't discourage going in the bushes. We ate our lunch al fresco and Ma always served homemade lemonade.''No need to come inside,'' she would say. ''It's summer'' -- although she herself rarely ventured outside the air-conditioned house. My father always told us, ''Your mother is an indoor girl.''After we passed two more summers this way, and she twice more entered her recipe, Ma gave up. She was sorry she had wasted so much time on a contest. She never won anything anyway, she said. By then, my brother and I were 13. We hated the bake-off people and believed the contest was rigged.My mother, however, shook off the rejection and continued to bake for many years, setting to work on ''blitzentorte'' and struffoli and pecan pie with bourbon. She was so prolific, in fact, that when she didn't produce dessert for a few days in a row, we knew something was wrong.In 2004, she suffered a stroke that led to complications and landed her in the hospital for weeks. Yet, even then, when we finally took her home, what she most wanted to do was get back to her pans, her mixing bowls and her stove.Propped up in the hospital bed I had ordered from a medical supply warehouse, she pointed toward the kitchen. ''I want to go in there,'' she said, searching for the word to describe her favorite room in the house. ''I want to make my cookies.''I knew immediately which ones she meant. I offered to bake some Bohemians myself.''Until you feel better, let me at least try,'' I said. I would do anything to spark an interest in food, as my once robust mother seemed to be shrinking daily. Ma always enjoyed baking more than eating, I knew, but she agreed.''I'll give you the recipe,'' she said.''No, no, no, Ma. You already gave it to me.''I had, in fact, been stealing Ma's recipe cards, one by one, from her kitchen cabinets since the stroke. I hid the cards in my pocketbook, in shopping bags, in my coat, afraid that my father or my brother might catch me taking something they wanted too.Ma had kept copies of the Bohemian recipe because so many people had asked for it. It directed the baker to roll the dough, whip egg whites into a meringue, add chopped chocolate chips and nuts, wrap the dough around the meringue, bake, slice and dust with confectioner's sugar. ''Anyone can make these!'' my mother wrote next to an asterisk, willing success on all comers.But a few years before my mother got sick I approached Bohemians on my own and discovered that anyone could not make these. It was 2001 and I had a full-time job, a baby daughter who was awake all night and asleep all day, and a fast and wily 3-year-old son. When the digital timer on the oven beeped, a dry, brown patch sat crumbling on the cookie tray. Of course, I was an inexperienced baker working in a brain fog, but there was another reason for this poor result. As I proofed yeast, separated eggs, whipped meringue and rolled out pastry dough -- what chefs call technique -- I understood. The judges had ignored Ma because, asterisk or no, her cookies were pretty hard to make, and I believe easy was a bake-off requirement.I had called my mother. ''I'm done with baking,'' I said. ''I'm so very tired. Your cookies are impossible.'' I never said the bake-off judges were right, but I was thinking it.My mother was a spry 77 years old then, still clipping recipes out of women's magazines and patiently improving them. She told me to get some rest and to try again. The yeast was probably old. (Wait, had I put any in?)Three years later, I did try again, only because my ailing mother couldn't. Every morning, before anyone in the neighborhood turned on the lights, when I really should have been dressing for work, I tried.I had entered my own personal bake-off, and time was running out. I baked for my children. I secretly hoped they'd band with me, and that we could form our own small club. I imagined them voting on which cookies were lightest, chewiest, best -- but they refused a taste. They ate only the cookies they saw advertised on television.My husband ate some of the experiments, but even he couldn't eat them all. I offered some to mothers watching their children play in the cul-de-sac. I served them to the plumber. I volunteered them at school.The cookies hit big. One of my friends said: ''You're wasting your time in the corporate world. You should bake for a living.'' No one asked for the recipe.I took the best batch to my mother. Gloria, the home health aide, clucked and glared at me from her post at the opposite end of the room. My mother was allowed only applesauce and mashed bananas. ''You know, you shouldn't be giving your mama something like that,'' Gloria said. ''She's gonna choke, and then what?''I turned my back to Gloria, broke off a tiny corner and put it between my mother's lips. She chewed and swallowed and sipped water through a straw. She rested between bites.Then she stopped eating and smiled and looked up at me. In that moment, she didn't quite recognize me. I might as well have been just another visiting nurse or physical therapist assigned to her case. It had happened before, but I always wondered where she went.''How did you find this recipe, dear?'' she asked. ''You know, I made Bohemians for years and years. Not just anyone can make these.''GENERATIONS</text></article><article id="1832147"><summary>Profile of and interview with Matthew Klein of Rye Brook, NY, serial tech entrepreneur and author of new novel Con Ed; photo (M)</summary><text>WHEN Matthew Klein sat down to write his thriller ''Con Ed,'' he had little taste for the standard heroes of the genre. Grizzled cops, feisty pathologists and clever lawyers left him cold. So he took a flier and made his lead character a con man -- albeit a likable one.His protagonist, Kip Largo, has just been released from prison and is trying to go straight. But when his grown son shows up in deep debt, Kip decides to bail him out by pulling off one last scam. He pretends to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who starts a high-tech software company that predicts the stock market. Throw some nasty members of the Russian mob, a wealthy Las Vegas developer and a few sexy women into this $20 million stock-manipulation scheme, and you've got Mr. Klein's new novel, to be released by Warner Books on Tuesday. (A book party will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. on Saturday at the Rye Free Reading Room, 1061 Boston Post Road.)Mr. Klein, who grew up in Westchester and lives in Rye Brook, is certainly qualified to write about the huge amounts of money that flowed through Silicon Valley at the height of the Internet bubble. The 38-year-old author was one of those archetypal whiz kids who started several technology companies during the boom. He is quick to point out, however, that his familiarity with scams is only a product of ''armchair research.''Self-described as ''freakishly tall'' -- he is 6 foot 7 -- Mr. Klein projects an air of both deep ambition and self-effacement. He shares with his more rough-hewn protagonist a somewhat forlorn sense of humor and a penchant for big ideas.Even during his college days at Yale, Mr. Klein revealed an entrepreneurial bent. He began a business delivering local restaurant food to students in their dorm rooms, and arranged with the university bursar for students to bill food directly to their parents' accounts. After graduating in 1990, he went on to Stanford Business School.''I always thought I wanted to run a business,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I know myself, and I'm really unemployable in the classical sense. I don't listen to people, and I think I know the answers, so that makes me think I should do stuff on my own.''He dropped out of business school just one quarter shy of graduating. He had been running a small software company in his apartment in Palo Alto, Calif., and venture capitalists approached him to run the business full time. The company, Release Software, was a personal information manager that could be opened and downloaded remotely, a new concept in 1994.That business didn't pan out, but Mr. Klein soon moved to a second venture, TechPlanet. His idea was to create a national brand of quality-controlled computer service technicians. At one point Mr. Klein had raised $40 million in venture capital, had 400 employees and was spending $1 million a day. So confident was he that he personally guaranteed the company debt. But problems arose. It turned out that few computer system installations were standard. Jobs were complicated, and the company had to hire talented technicians and pay them accordingly. The business kept expanding, with no eye toward profitability. Investors pulled out, and ultimately the venture became what Mr. Klein described as ''a very public, spectacular failure.''Lawyers and creditors hounded him. It took him years to dig out. But he is nothing if not resilient, and Mr. Klein came up with yet another idea. His new company, Collective2, audits various algorithmic stock-trading services, tracking their results, and offers a marketplace for those who want to trade using them. Once the company was up and running, he turned his attention to writing ''Con Ed.''Writing a novel and writing computer software, he said, aren't as different as one might think. ''There's a lot of aesthetics involved in both, but the elegance of a piece of computer software is sort of private; only the coders know,'' he said. ''The talent lies in the judgment, and I think you need that in writing software and writing novels.''So Mr. Klein is running a business with software that aims to predict the stock market at the same time that he has written a book about a con artist who runs a company that claims to predict the stock market? Might that make customers a little nervous?''I hadn't really thought of it that way,'' Mr. Klein said, laughing. ''I think companies pretty much stand on their own, and if you can make money for someone, they're willing to overlook pretty much anything.''BOOK BUSINESS</text></article><article id="1832148"><summary>Article on Let's Dish and Sip &amp; Supper, new meal-preparation stores that have opened in Westchester County, NY; photos (M)</summary><text>SUSAN GERATZ is preparing jambalaya for her family of four, but she is not in the kitchen of her Dobbs Ferry home and she has not done any grocery shopping. A few feet away, Byron Smalls of White Plains is preparing two servings of pork tenderloin, one for him and the other for his mother.Ms. Geratz and Mr. Smalls are spending the morning with friends at Let's Dish, a meal-preparation store that opened in Scarsdale in September. A month later Sip &amp; Supper opened in Tuckahoe. And the trend continues, with two more meal-preparation stores planned for New Rochelle and Nanuet.''I'm cooking-challenged,'' Ms. Geratz said with a laugh. ''This makes me look like a good cook, and no one has to know. It's a home-cooked meal, and my husband is very appreciative.''Meal-preparation stores provide customers with a selection of a dozen or more entrees that are assembled at refrigerated workstations containing all the ingredients, cut, diced or sliced, ready to be used. Only the actual cooking is done at home, giving new meaning to the term ''home-cooked meal.''Begun in Washington and Texas, the concept has traveled East. Demand is growing, with more than 1,200 outlets in the United States and others expected to open in Australia, Britain and France. Industry revenues were $7.2 million in 2003 and are expected to climb to $504 million this year and more than $1 billion by 2010, according to the Easy Meal Prep Association, the industry trade group.Marianne and Tom Delaney of Crestwood were strolling past Sip &amp; Supper when its owner, Paul Ross, invited them in. The Delaneys said that with their ''crazy hours'' -- she is an associate athletic director at Fordham University in the Bronx, and he is a director at Verizon -- the thought of bringing dinner home to the table, without shopping or preparation, was appealing. ''We decided to try the Korean skirt steak,'' Mrs. Delaney said. ''What's great is that he basically does all the hard work,'' she said of Mr. Ross. ''We just take it home and cook it.''Erin Krestinski of Bronxville has three children -- the oldest is 4 -- so ''45 minutes in the kitchen is not going to happen,'' she said.''I think everyone is busy, whether you're a working mom or not, and the event is fun,'' Mrs. Krestinski said of the social crowd gathered at Sip &amp; Supper. ''If someone came and prepped and cleaned up after me, I'd be cooking every night.''Meal-preparation stores can customize menus for private parties or special groups. Holly Quiles and her husband, Henry, just started H2Q Fitness in Bronxville, and she is working with Sip &amp; Supper to create nutritious meals for her clients.Although Sip &amp; Supper takes walk-ins, most stores ask customers to sign up for a specific session and require a four-dish minimum. Meals range from $22 to $26 and typically serve four to six people.''I look at what I spend to buy dinner with another person, and I'm usually spending $80,'' Mr. Smalls said. ''Here, for the same amount, I can get three to four dinners.''On a recent Friday morning at the Scarsdale store, two groups of women were chatting over coffee and scones, ready ''to dish.''Therese Hunersen, the owner of Let's Dish, smiled. ''We've created a lot of double entendres for the word,'' she said.COMMERCE</text></article><article id="1832150"><summary>Benjamin Genocchio reviews exhibit of garden-themed contemporary photography on view at Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, NY; photos (M)</summary><text>The gasps you may hear throughout the rooms of the Hudson River Museum this month are the sounds of visitors welcoming an early spring. ''Contemporary Photography and the Garden,'' which brings together the works of 16 American and European artists, is all about flowers and greenery -- cultivated, wild, mysterious and preserved.In the late 19th century, gardens drew the attention of pioneer photographers, among them Eug&#232;ne Atget, who around 1900 began to take photographs of Parisian parks. They have not been an important subject for modern day photographers, however, who, like their viewers, gravitate toward urban life. Perhaps that is about to change.Whatever the reason behind the upswing in garden photographs, this kind of art addresses itself primarily to the senses: the displays range from depictions of unruly primordial nooks redolent with tropical funk to more sedate and stately scenes of manicured European and Asian gardens, including several curious images by Jean Rault of the remains of the private vegetable and fruit garden created by Louis XIV on the grounds at Versailles, outside Paris.Of all the images of cultivated gardens here, none are more beautiful than Geoffrey James's exquisite, compact little photographs of Italian Baroque gardens and villas, often including imagery of classical statuary, fountains and viewing balconies. The artist works with an antique panoramic camera to capture the full, often mathematically inspired spatial arrangements of these classically inspired gardens, inviting viewers to appreciate the physical grandeur of the spaces.Close scrutiny of the more than 60 works in the exhibition reveals a surprising diversity of styles; some photographers simply document what they see, while others try to summon a sense of mystery. Len Jenshel's photographs of quiet corners of suburban gardens make immediately clear what they are and what they mean. By contrast, Sally Gall's misty, black-and-white imagery of the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden leaves you with a feeling of fear and tension: something happened there.Ms. Gall's photographs often combine imagery of gardens and bodies of water, ''creating rich tonal contrasts,'' as the wall label notes, ''through a patterning of shadow and light.'' The same quality pervades Sally Mann's six photographs of Las Pozas (The Pools) in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico, the fanciful garden built by the poet and surrealist patron and collector Edward James (1907--1984). Bathed in an ethereal glow, the place as depicted in her photographs looks suspended in time. It is even kind of creepy.The images of Lynn Geesaman, an immense talent who deserves to be much better known, also manage to make gardens seem mysterious and strange. This is partly because she photographs them from unusual or unexpected points of view, denuded of people, and partly because she likes to enhance her imagery in the printing process with slight special effects that heighten the contrasts of tone and the outlines between objects. The end result is a series of dreamlike pictures with an attention to light at its most allusive and enchanting. I completely love her work.The aim of other artists showing here is nothing more, or less, than to capture the exquisite beauty of flowers, plants and other botanical specimens. They wish to dazzle us with their imagery and often do. Near the entrance to the museum is Peter Fischli and David Weiss's ''Projection 2 (Summer)'' (1997), two sets of overlapping, dissolving projected color slides of flowers shot in gardens in Switzerland at different times of the year. Blending into one another, the images create the impression of a dense flowery environment.Marc Quinn also pays tribute to the beauty of flowers, though in his case the imagery is tinged with sadness. He has photographed flowers that he had frozen in liquid silicone and refrigerated for an earlier installation and printed the images on canvas using commercial inkjet technology. The beauty of the flowers is preserved indefinitely, but they were killed in the process -- a fitting metaphor for the futility of trying to preserve transient beauty.''Contemporary Photography and the Garden,'' Hudson River Museum, 511 Warburton Avenue, Yonkers, through May 13.

We asked for recommendations under $50. Mr. Castaldo checked our food order and made fine suggestions.When the kitchen is on track, diners can expect some remarkable dishes, beautifully presented and surprisingly inventive, like the sashimi scallop ''ravioli'': two thin slices of scallop encasing osetra caviar and, for design balance, one light streak of beet juice dotted with jewels of green cr&#232;me fra&#238;che and a lattice of fried lotus -- a marvel in taste and aesthetics.Tiny tender mouthfuls of mostly boneless quail made a superb starter, as did big luscious chunks of crab atop avocado. Agnolotti -- four almost transparent pasta wrappings -- were stuffed with fava beans and sprinkled with corn and prosciutto. Parmesan gnocchi brought feathery dumplings with an earthy wild mushroom sauce. The poached clams, though delicious, came with a too-rich cream sauce, and the artichoke salad was overly astringent.Another problem arose with an appetizer best left, it would seem, to Japanese experts: a prettily presented trio of bluefin tuna brought only passable components of a slice of peppered, seared tuna; tuna tartare that was somewhat better; and a roll of tuna and crab that was coarse and heavy.Kittle House is not a steakhouse, but this restaurant's modestly named ''steak and eggs'' would fit in the best of those meateries. The tender, thick prime filet arrived crowned with two poached quail eggs, every ingredient first class. Skirt steak with pommes frites and an awkward duet of braised short ribs and grilled sirloin were fine, but in a lesser league.A light basil crust and side of aromatic root vegetables elevated the clear taste of perfectly cooked king salmon. And quickly charred, thick blocks of bluefin tuna atop vegetable ''linguine'' (like sweated slaw) came with modified sushi riffs like wasabi foamed with cr&#232;me fra&#238;che and edamame pur&#233;e. But overdone halibut with lentils and tough baby turnips had little focus, and exotic-sounding but ordinary-tasting wheels of rainbow trout, served in a bowl of broth, came with honshimeji mushrooms whose crispness was unfortunately cooked out.A gossamer lobster sauce pooled around four huge succulent sea scallops. Tender truffled free-range chicken was further enhanced by sweet medjool date foam and caramelized cauliflower. Although heavy for an entree, squash risotto was nonetheless nicely thought out, with tart apple and pumpkin seeds adding zing and texture. A neat stack of fingerlings shared the plate with excellent lamb.Desserts will appeal to every taste: a trio of chocolate rounds of mousse with a shot glass of cardamom-scented white chocolate; ultracreamy Grand Marnier ice cream; melting chocolate in a beribboned ''package''; poached pear topped with a sugary puff-pastry leaf. But the pecan pie was achingly sweet and the carrot cake a tad stale. Those without a sweet tooth can choose from an assortment of almost a dozen cheeses.A few quibbles: Two executive chefs are in charge, making it impossible to know who was responsible for a couple of slapdash presentations of lukewarm food or for dishes so brilliant and precious they might have been assembled using a jeweler's loupe.And Sunday's buffet brunch seemed like an afterthought. Set up in a dreary side room, the table held the usual salads, bacon and sausage, dry scrambled eggs and pasta, and as early as midbrunch, these selections were picked through and needed refreshing. A raw bar held clams and oysters opened too far in advance to be lively, and a tough, bloodless roast sat on the carving station. Other egg dishes could be ordered from the kitchen.At one dinner, kitchen help hauled up sacks of ingredients in full view of diners. As the restaurant has expanded, traffic patterns within it have changed; it may be time for an objective eye to suggest some sprucing up and reconfiguring to this place we love.Crabtree's Kittle House11 Kittle Road  Chappaqua  (914) 666-8044  www.kittlehouse.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE -- Simply decorated rambling dining rooms in a renovated Colonial house accommodate large and small groups.

And Vietnamese cuisine, with its global influences and flavorings of fish sauce, lemon grass and fresh herbs, is a welcome addition to New Brunswick's restaurant district.Loan Tran, the chef, owns the 45-seat restaurant, which opened in October, with a cousin. (One server, Tien Pham, translated as she spoke with me.) Having learned to cook from her mother, who catered weddings in her native Vietnam, she previously worked at the Saigon Restaurant in South Plainfield.Among the appetizers on the large menu, one entry was outstanding on two visits: the light and savory crepe that overflowed with shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and onions. Another favorite was the chicken salad, sparked with mint and turned crunchy with shredded cabbage. Grilled beef wrapped in lettuce was rich and delicious. Grilled shrimp on sugar cane, though nicely flavored, was heavy and pasty.On two occasions, the fresh rolls were overburdened with rice vermicelli noodles and a one-dimensional sauce that was too sweet. On another night, however, the sauce, with the classic bite of red chilies, lime juice and fish sauce, was fine served with a more balanced pork version of the rolls.Pho (beef noodle soup) can be transporting, and the broth here was deeply flavored; Ms. Tran says she makes it with bones and beef, as well as ginger, shallots, star anise, cinnamon, onion, fennel seeds and dried apple. But one night, two types of pho -- one with brisket and the other with slices of steak and beef balls -- lacked spark without the green herbs that accompany the bean sprouts on the typical condiment plate. Ms. Tran said then that the supplier's herbs weren't fresh, so she didn't serve them; yet on another night, a couple of weeks later, the plate again was wan and white, with only bean sprouts and lemon.Chicken pho fared better, though it, too, could have used a few fresh greens. The variety of ingredients in the seafood soup -- shrimp, crab, scallop, pork and chicken -- added interest, but the clear noodle version with shrimp, crab, pork and quail egg seemed most complete.In the rice noodle category of the menu, the version topped with grilled chicken was tender and succulent, its juices nicely moistening the grain. The Hue-style hot and spicy beef soup with chilies, lemon grass and red cabbage was satisfying once I added lots of salt.Among the steamed white rice dishes, the grilled pork chop, with its accompanying patty of shredded pork and crab meat, was delicious; so was Ms. Tran's version of spicy curry chicken and lemon grass.Grilled, rolled beef was chewy but well flavored, with onion hidden inside the rolls, which, in turn, were to be rolled in bits of romaine leaf. The grilled pork paste (think flat meatball) was disappointing, with bits of bone in almost every bite.There are canned sodas and typical fruit shakes (banana, strawberry or pineapple) as well as more interesting ones: durian, with an echo of the stinkiness for which it is known; a very mild light-green avocado; a citrusy soursop; and jackfruit, with an echo of banana and pineapple. Drinks include young coconut juice, deliciously light and refreshing, and either litchi or longan, a similar fruit, with ice. (The fruit sits atop a glass of ice water sweetened with nectar.) The pickled plum with club soda was a revelation, however: salty and pungent, it simultaneously quenched and created thirst.Desserts were luscious, particularly the quivery flan dressed with espresso syrup. It kept me awake into the night, thinking about replicating it at home.Mekong Vietnamese Restaurant  351 George Street  New Brunswick  (732) 545-5757  www.mekongnb.comGOODTHE SPACE Small, no-frills storefront; cooking space is tucked into a back corner, behind a counter.

It does not serve guacamole, and the burritos are not the size of pillows. That the restaurant does not serve fajitas is mentioned three times.In short, if you're a fan of chain-style Mexican fare, you probably won't appreciate the food at Taqueria Downtown.And there is a lot to appreciate. Eight different tacos including fish ($3), cactus ($2.50) and pork ($2), each served with cilantro, onion, salsa and lime and a slice of radish. The grilled steak quesadilla ($5.95) melts in your mouth. Tamales, flautas, enchiladas, burritos and full dinners like grilled pork chops with green salsa ($9.95) are on the menu. The taqueria has no liquor license, but customers are encouraged to bring their own.Since opening in November 2005, the restaurant has become an instant classic. The owners, Andrea Azpeitia and Phil Barraza, who are Mexican, ran a taco truck across from City Hall before opening in a basement across the street from the Boys and Girls Club of Hudson County. The inside is reminiscent of a college dormitory, with bright yellow walls covered with magazine cutouts, album covers and holiday lights.As funky as the d&#233;cor may be, the owners are serious about the food.''We feel like there are very, very few places where you can get authentic Mexican food that is not Americanized or Tex-Mex,'' Ms. Azpeitia said. ''There are restaurants who realize that Mexican food has become popular and want to profit, but they don't do it right. And that offends us.''Taqueria Downtown, 236 Grove Street, Jersey City; (201) 333-3220.

C. Westermann (1922-1981), a former acrobat, decorated marine and rugged individualist who made homespun, absurdist sculptures, occupied a position on the outer fringe of the art scene. Nowadays, he is being given the kind of respect he deserves, even lauded by critics as a bona fide, one-of-a-kind American genius.The re-evaluation of Westermann began in earnest in early 2001 with a traveling retrospective organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Now comes ''Dreaming of a Speech Without Words: The Paintings and Early Objects of H. C. Westermann,'' at the Montclair Art Museum, a traveling show organized by the Contemporary Museum, Honolulu. It complements the retrospective, focusing on the artist's little-known body of paintings and early sculptures.Part of this reappraisal is a means of coming to terms with the artist's extraordinary originality: though inspired by Surrealism and Dada in general, and the artists Alberto Giacometti and Joseph Cornell in particular, his elegantly simple, meticulously handcrafted assemblages and tableaux inside little boxes, often containing figures, are not only genuinely idiosyncratic but also very often deeply moving. There is much to be admired here. But what also makes Westermann attractive these days is, perhaps, his remarkable personal story.Born in Los Angeles, he had his youth cut short by the outbreak of World War II. He served onboard the carrier Enterprise in the Pacific, where he saw constant action; he witnessed a kamikaze attack on the aircraft carrier Franklin, which resulted in the death of almost 1,000 fellow marines. He returned to the United States, where he enrolled on the G.I. Bill at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, only to have his studies interrupted by a tour of duty in Korea. Back in Chicago again, he worked as a carpenter, making paintings and Surrealist-style assemblages on weekends.The present exhibition displays about 50 paintings, sculptures and drawings from the late 1940s to the early 60s. The sculptures from this period tend to be pretty well known; they are mostly small, exquisitely worked objects (a sort of combination of folk art and cabinetmaking) exploring existential crises provoked by his military service and the nihilism of the Cold War era. As the exhibition catalog points out, the works suggest a man profoundly unhappy with, even tortured by, the state of the world back then. He had little faith in humanity.Practically unknown from these early years, however, are his paintings, most of which date from 1949, when he enrolled as a student at the Art Institute, to 1954, when he began to make sculpture consistently. He produced around 20 paintings, according to art historians, around a dozen of which have been patiently assembled here. Together they enable us to see for the first time the connections between his early paintings and the sculptures that followed.The exhibition is arranged more or less thematically to illustrate these relationships, beginning with the pairing of an early painting, ''The Reluctant Acrobat'' (1949), with one of his wall assemblage sculptures, ''Two Acrobats and a Fleeing Man'' (1957). Both pieces have formal roots in Dada and Surrealism, suggesting that Westermann established his basic themes and visual style in his paintings and continued them in his sculptures.The next group of works in the exhibition shows the artist experimenting with different styles. One is struck by the detail and skill of his early paintings and drawings, some of which, like an untitled still life from c. 1948, showing a cloth draped over a marble block, suggest an artist of immense skill and dexterity. Westermann, it would seem, was less a folk or outsider artist than an artist with an interest in folk and outsider-style art.Works with anti-military themes dominate these years. ''The Storm" (c. 1953-54) is a painting obviously based on Picasso's ''Guernica'' (1937), about atrocities committed during the Spanish Civil War. Similarly, Westermann attempts to communicate the misery and suffering of war, conveyed largely though the agony of a dying horse. In the distance there are rain clouds, while a lightning bolt drops from the sky. The world is in turmoil.Westermann's paintings from the mid-1950s suggest the growing influence of Constructivism and the Bauhaus, and perhaps Matisse. The exhibition catalog even points to a possible link with German Expressionism, though this is not really borne out though an analysis of the pictures. At any rate, it was at this point that he made the transition from painting on canvas to creating assemblage sculptures, at first with two-dimensional painted works and then three-dimensional sculptural forms, examples of which fill out the final section of the show.Coming away from this impressive, insightful exhibition, one cannot help wondering how or why Westermann was excised from American art history during his lifetime. He had the talent, and though his works clearly draw on Surrealism and Cornell for inspiration, they have a feeling and sensibility that are all his own.''Dreaming of a Speech Without Words: The Paintings and Early Objects of H. C. Westermann,'' Montclair Art Museum, 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, through May 27.

Playing Jim, a Seattle office temp, in Dan Dietz's surreal new comedy ''tempOdyssey,'' Mr. Nathanson pulls out every stop for a brilliant tour de force.Seeing is not quite believing as we watch this loose-limbed, lumpish young man, shirttails hanging and thick, black-rimmed glasses askew, spastically flopping around the stage portraying a corpse with a broken neck. That's right, a corpse, done in, inadvertently but deftly, by his fellow temp, Little Genny (Stephanie Thompson), a former chicken choker from the back hills of Georgia, whose search for the meaning of life in a universe pockmarked by black holes finds her cracking the necks of anyone who gets too close.''You killed me,'' he screams at Genny. ''Why?''''It's what I do,'' she matter-of-factly answers. That is how she killed chickens as a young girl in Georgia, becoming a local celebrity and the pride of her farmer daddy (David Sitler).If all this sounds too bizarre by half, then think again. Mr. Dietz's postmodern fairy tale -- Homer meets the Brothers Grimm and Stephen Hawking -- is laugh-out-loud funny yet strangely moving. Stranded in the cubicle-centered culture of corporate America (which Mr. Dietz captures perfectly), Genny and Jim struggle to retain their humanity.Genny, played with sass and a heartbreaking vulnerability by the talented Ms. Thompson, may protest that she is ''in the office, not of the office.'' But after receiving her marching orders -- never leave your desk; bathroom only twice a day; lunch at 3 o'clock -- from the Last Day Girl (Andrea Gallo) and then being bullied by the C.E.O.'s creepy nephew Roy (Ian August), she begins to lose her cool. And while Jim may at first appear in control of his destiny, insisting that he is strictly a temp and could never be lured into even an executive slot, it takes only a suggestion from Genny that he has gone ''permanent'' to turn him into a banshee.Sturgis Warner directs the mayhem with a sure comic hand while not letting the absurdity in Mr. Dietz's play cancel out its very real search for connection and meaning. His fine cast never lets him down. Catching the raw pain on Ms. Thompson's face as she confronts her father, and seeing her body recoil in horror as she is overtaken by memories of her tormented childhood, one feels the powerful collaboration between director and actor. Mr. Sitler adds dramatic heft with a strong performance as the hillbilly chicken farmer.Jo Winiarski's jumbled set, with rows of oddly shaped file cabinets and an elevator to nowhere, contributes to the sense of skewed reality, and Jessica Paz and Jill Nagle's stunning sound and light shows suggest a universe in cosmic disarray.Get in on the fun, but be sure to buckle your seat belt. This is one wild ride.''tempOdyssey'' is at the New Jersey Repertory Company, 179 Broadway, Long Branch, through March 18.

The Paradise, in the Bronx, has just come alive as a performance hall, the Loew's Jersey has reopened in the same format, and two others became churches long ago.Then, there is the sad, unwonderful case of Loew's Kings in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where Barbra Streisand was once a regular moviegoer. Taken over by New York City in 1978 for back taxes, it has been struggling ever since it shut its doors. Repeated attempts to reopen it -- in any form -- have come to naught.It was in the 1920s, after the lower costs of movies took dramatic entertainment to the masses, that the Paramount-Publix chain began planning a series of exceptionally grand theaters in the New York area. Its first, the Brooklyn Paramount, was begun in 1927.Warren G. Harris, a theater historian, says that the Loew's chain, which was very strong in New York, then offered Paramount-Publix a deal: drop your theater-building program in New York, and we will not compete with you in the Chicago area.The deal was done, and Loew's picked up what became the wonder theater project, building five by 1930: the Valencia, in Jamaica, Queens; the Kings, on Flatbush Avenue near Beverly Road; the Jersey, on Journal Square in Jersey City; the Paradise, at 184th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx; and the 175th Street Theater, on Broadway in Upper Manhattan. Each seated 3,000 or more and was designed to look like the kind of place you would live in if you were royalty in some part of the world.They were not identical by any means. The Spanish-style Valencia and Paradise were both designed by John Eberson, with his atmospheric open-sky ceilings. The Kings and the Jersey were designed by Rapp &amp; Rapp in the French style with terra-cotta facades. The 175th Street was done in what Norval White and Elliot Willensky call ''Cambodian neo-Classical'' in their A.I.A. Guide to New York City (Crown, 2000).When the working classes showed up at the opening of the Kings in September 1929, they paid 25 to 60 cents to hear Wesley Eddy and his Kings of Syncopation and David Pesetzki conducting the theater's grand orchestra and to see Delores Del Rio in person, along with her movie ''Evangeline.''At that point, going to the movies still meant taking in both stage and screen presentations. Advertisements of the period indicate that the same films played in two or three theaters, while each appears to have had its own stage show.But that fall Architecture and Building magazine observed that Loew's Kings was ''probably the first theater to be designed particularly to meet the needs of the presentation of the talking picture,'' because nearly 3,000 of its 3,690 seats were on the ground floor to avoid the acoustical disruptions caused by big balconies. The magazine called the style ''Italian baroque,'' but modern writers see a French influence in the interior and the terra-cotta facade.The term ''wonder theater'' has escaped exact definition, but the Kings is like most other multi-thousand-seat houses in several ways: it has a colossal grand foyer, perhaps 50 feet high, with heavily gilt classical decoration, as well as carefully designed exits and entrances for crowd management during show changes. The auditorium, too, is loaded with decoration.Stage shows went out in the 1930s, and by the 1960s the old palaces sought new revenue. In 1964, boxing fans at the Kings and the Valencia paid $6.75 each to see a closed-circuit broadcast of the Liston-Clay prizefight, in which Cassius Clay -- soon known as Muhammad Ali -- won the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston in six rounds.In the later 1960s and in the 1970s, the wonder theaters gradually shifted to different uses or shut their doors completely, the Kings in 1977.Last fall, the New York City Economic Development Corporation asked for suggestions from developers on what to do with the Kings. Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the agency, will say only that more than one proposal has been received and that the city will try to move beyond the initial stage of the project later this spring. In its solicitation, the city noted that the building had suffered ''substantial damage and deterioration.'' For instance, the roofs over its retail spaces have collapsed.What distinguished the five wonder theaters from the other Loew's picture palaces was never really clear. Indeed, a 1930 ad in The New York Times included the Loew's Pitkin, also in Brooklyn, as one of its ''Big 5 Wonder Theaters'' although theater-history buffs do not include it on their lists.That the term also had a generic use is suggested by a letter to the editor of The Chicago Tribune in 1928. The writer declared that for a structure ''to be a 'wonder theater,' it must be absolutely hideous.'' Also, in 1923, The Boston Daily Globe carried an item on the B. F. Keith circuit's plans for a series of ''wonder theaters.''A recent search of half a dozen major papers digitized by ProQuest found the first appearance of the term in a 1918 ad in The Chicago Tribune for the Chicago Theater, still standing on State Street. Perhaps it was there that the term was coined, because the Chicago was operated by Balaban &amp; Katz, and by 1927 the firm was associated with Paramount-Publix, which is now generally credited with the ''wonder theater'' idea.E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1832204"><summary>Living In article on Red Hook, Brooklyn; maps; photo (M)</summary><text>RED HOOK, a nub of a Brooklyn peninsula jutting into the Buttermilk Channel opposite Governors Island, is perhaps not everyone's ideal place to live. A high-crime area not very long ago, it is at times eerily silent, at others mournfully full of the noise of industry. Broken glass and cracked sidewalks can still be found; amenities, while on the increase, are still relatively few. Large chunks of formerly solid rows of houses have been torn out. And by the way, there's no subway stop.Even so, the neighborhood's fan club has a growing membership, for whom all the quirks and quibbles only enhance its status as a uniquely great place to live.The water, quiet except for the hum of tugboats, and its breeze are always near; holdovers from the area's longshoreman days, like Sunny's Bar (established in 1890), attract residents old and new; and despite rising incomes, there remains a striking mix of ethnicities and occupations. This is most evident in the art galleries and, in summer, at the pan-Latino buffet of food stands around the waterfront ball fields.''It was just this kind of eclectic mix that gave off this unique feel I never felt anywhere,'' said Yvonne Negron, 37, a master's student in social work at New York University who lives with her partner, Tina Luongo, in a renovated two-bedroom condominium on Richards Street.''We said, 'We're staying here; we're going to die here,' '' Ms. Negron recalled. ''I completely fell in love with it.''Before Ms. Luongo, 39, a lawyer and merchant, and Ms. Negron bought their apartment for $600,000 last year (they moved in Jan. 30), they lived in a rental on Van Brunt Street, the neighborhood's main commercial strip, above what is now the Cruise Liner Cafe, named for the new cruise terminal to the north. They hadn't been planning to buy an apartment for another few years; when they saw the renovated walk-up building on Richards Street with its wide backyard patios, they joked that it would one day be their penthouse apartment. The day came sooner than expected.''We always joke around -- 'Wait a minute, we live in this place; how did that happen?' '' Ms. Luongo said, alluding to amenities like the Jacuzzi, roof deck, large kitchen with granite countertops, working fireplace and central air-conditioning.Ms. Luongo used to operate a pet supply store on Van Brunt Street but has turned that space into a wine bar called Tini, which opened in September and has thus far fitted well with Red Hook's growing restaurant row.A 52,000-square-foot Fairway supermarket, installed last May in a Civil War-era warehouse with rental apartments being prepared above, is yet another harbinger of change. And east of Fairway on the waterfront, work is progressing on an Ikea furniture outlet.With more warehouses and row houses being redone and converted to condominiums, and with houses selling for a third or a fourth of the price they might command in nearby Carroll Gardens, the real estate market in Red Hook is a different universe than it was just 10 years ago.What You'll FindLong before real estate minds had a hand in renaming ever-smaller New York neighborhoods, Red Hook stretched up the Brooklyn waterfront into what today is called either Carroll Gardens West or the Columbia Street District. But by 1950, two Robert Moses structures -- the Gowanus Expressway and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel -- separated the heart of Red Hook from its northern reaches. These days, the neighborhood is predominantly regarded as everything south of the expressway and tunnel entrance and west of the Gowanus Canal.Every so often, you will run into someone who still refers to the ''front'' and ''back'' of the neighborhood, with the ''front'' consisting of the Red Hook Houses, a 1938 public housing project that, with 8,000 residents, is among the city's largest. Though the back of the neighborhood -- the area between the Red Hook Houses and the water -- contains far fewer people, it is the part most commonly thought of as Red Hook, with its cobblestone streets, industrial businesses and pockets of bustling street life.One significant part of this latter area is Van Brunt Street, named for an old Dutch farming family in Brooklyn. Most, if not all, of Red Hook's up-and-coming commercial enterprises have set up shop here -- from Pioneer Bar-B-Q with its Scrabble nights and beer, to an upscale liquor shop called LeNell's, as well as small, highly praised restaurants like the Good Fork and 360. Mixed in along the way are not-yet-priced-out bodegas, bagel joints, a funeral home, a flea market and a boutique or two. The street ends at the water and the Fairway, then jogs east to become a long warehouse pier with modern businesses inside.Running both parallel and perpendicular to Van Brunt Street are bumpy streets with stretches of row houses, some dirty and crumbling, others spruced up and new with for-sale signs in their windows. South of the Red Hook Houses and east of the ''back'' are those ball fields, packed most summer evenings with players and tamale stands. The fields are organized around Red Hook's lone skyscraper, a decrepit grain elevator that one imagines could someday become waterfront condos, as did a Baltimore Harbor grain pier on HBO's ''The Wire.''All along the waterfront are reminders, functioning and not, of Red Hook's industrial past. One recently dismantled, to the anger of preservationists fighting a development, was the former Revere Sugar Plant's silo. A sunken lightship, its masts stretching above water near the silo for decades, was also removed.What You'll PayResidential sales are rare, if only because there are so few properties on the market at any given time.''It's pretty sporadic,'' said Joyce Kafati-Batarse, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman who works on development projects. ''There's not really a lot of supply in the neighborhood.''Frank Galeano of Frank Galeano Real Estate agreed. ''People are not anxious to sell the property they own down there,'' he said. ''Whatever does become available is usually snapped up pretty quickly.''And because Red Hook's housing stock is not exactly consistent, customers are at times dissatisfied with the available choices. Yet those priced out of Carroll Gardens and Park Slope are still finding the selection in Red Hook fairly priced. So, demand for anything that comes onto the market is high.''If something's priced appropriately and it's in good condition, it sells very quickly,'' said Beth Kenkel, a vice president of the Corcoran Group. Last April, Ms. Kenkel sold a 1,000-square-foot condo loft on Conover Street in a building two blocks from the water for $599,000. In condos, Ms. Kafati-Batarse said, prices average $550 per square foot.In house sales, Mr. Galeano said, the average for a two-family with commercial space on the ground floor is around $1.5 million; his firm is currently selling a property with a one-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom and restaurant space on Van Brunt Street for $1.35 million.Rents have risen in the last few years, though one-bedrooms can still be found for $1,500 to $2,000 a month, with two-bedrooms at $2,000 and above. In the former factory of the Monarch Luggage Company on Delavan and Verona Streets, where Mr. Galeano rents apartments, a 1,500-foot unit rents for about $2,200 a month, he said.What to DoThe arrival of Fairway has squelched the common neighborhood complaint about grocery shopping. Ms. Luongo and Ms. Negron often take in the latest works at galleries like the Kentler International Drawing Space. And they sample every dish they can at local restaurants. They stroll in the parks with their dogs, and walk down to Valentino Pier, at the end of Coffey Street, for superior sunsets and wide-angle views of New York Harbor, with the Statue of Liberty at center stage.The HistoryIn 1847, a group of piers called Atlantic Basin opened at the bottom of the neighborhood, taking advantage of Red Hook's position in New York Harbor. A shipping business boomed, attracting thousands of longshoremen and their families, not to mention a young Al Capone. But eventually the neighborhood was severed from the rest of Brooklyn by the tunnel and the expressway; most of the shipping moved to New Jersey, and blight crept in. Artists arrived in the 1970s and 80s, beginning the familiar pattern of rejuvenation.The SchoolsWithin what is commonly known as Red Hook, there are at least three schools. At Public School 15, an elementary school, students performed just under city averages in the year ended in 2005, with 64.4 percent meeting standards on city and state tests in math, versus 65.1 percent citywide. In English the number was 54.2 percent versus 60.9 percent citywide.Middle school students can attend the Agnes Y. Humphrey School for Leadership, which offers prekindergarten through Grade 8. Of students in Grades 3 to 8, 33.2 percent met English standards in 2004-05, compared with 51.2 percent citywide; 20.4 percent met math standards, while 52 percent did so citywide.For older students, there is the South Brooklyn Community High School for Leadership, where the verbal SAT average in 2004-05 was 410, versus 497 statewide; the school's math average was 395, the state's 511.The CommuteWithout a car, most Red Hook commuters to Manhattan walk the better part of a mile to the Smith-Ninth Street or Carroll Street stop on the F and G lines. Others wait for the B61 bus, which runs every 10 minutes or so during the day and once an hour late at night. The bus travels between Queens Plaza and Red Hook, stopping in Downtown Brooklyn at or near the A, C and F trains at Jay Street-Borough Hall and the 2, 3, 4, 5, M and R trains at Borough Hall.A SnapshotYouths dive off Valentino Pier, illegally, in the summer, as an old fisherman casts his lure into the harbor. Nearby, a couple park their new-looking bikes near a welcoming bench. These are images that define Red Hook, at least for the moment.Going ForwardSome residents say the coming of Ikea and Fairway has already added too much traffic to local streets. Traffic-flow solutions, including more mass transit, would not be unwelcome.ON THE MARKET121 Dikeman Street  A 3,600-square-foot five-family house with an asking price of $1.3 million.

But most windows aren't very good at stopping noise.''In apartment buildings and in buildings made of brick or stone, almost all outside noise comes through the windows,'' said David Skudin, the president of CitiQuiet in Long Island City, Queens, a company that makes and installs soundproof windows.''A standard window is eliminating something like 40 to 50 percent of outside noise,'' Mr. Skudin said. ''But it is possible to eliminate almost all outside noise without changing the exterior appearance of the window.''The most common way to do that, he said, is to install a second window designed to reduce sound, mounting it on the inside.''We fabricate and install a soundproof interior window that lines up identically with the existing window,'' Mr. Skudin said. For example, if the existing window is the double-hung type, with two sashes that move up and down, then the sashes of the soundproof window will line up with them and will move up and down, too.If the existing window is a slider or a casement window, the interior window will mimic it.The soundproofing is accomplished, Mr. Skudin said, by using laminated glass for the interior window and creating dead-air space between the interior and exterior windows.The laminated glass can be anywhere from a quarter to seven-eighths of an inch thick and is made by fusing a clear plastic membrane between two sheets of glass. The dead-air space is created by mounting the interior window three or four inches from the existing window.''Depending on the thickness of the glass and the amount of dead-air space,'' Mr. Skudin said, ''we can eliminate up to 95 percent of outside noise.''Michael Damelin, the president of Cityproof, another Long Island City soundproof-window company, said that since the interior window does not change the exterior appearance of the building, most co-ops and condominiums, as well as New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission, will allow owners to install them. And since the windows do not involve structural work or reduce light and air, a building permit is generally not necessary.Mr. Damelin noted that while most unwanted noise comes in through windows, it can also creep in around and through air-conditioners.''If an air-conditioner is mounted in the window,'' he said, ''we will try to mount the soundproof window so that the air-conditioner is enclosed inside it.'' The soundproof window is then opened when the air-conditioner is turned on. For air-conditioners that are installed through the wall, Mr. Damelin said, Cityproof will build a soundproof enclosure that can also be opened and closed.Do-it-yourselfers can buy custom-made soundproof windows from suppliers like Soundproofwindows.com in Fremont, Calif.Randy Brown, the owner of the company, said that home or apartment owners take their own measurements, following the instructions on the company's Web site, and send them in. The company then makes the soundproof interior windows to the customer's specifications, using quarter-inch laminated glass.''If you can use a power screwdriver,'' Mr. Brown said, ''you can install our windows.''He noted that in addition to reducing the noise, properly installed soundproof windows also make the house or apartment more energy-efficient by eliminating drafts.The price of soundproof windows varies sharply depending on how large the windows are, how thick the laminated glass is and whether the window is installed professionally or by the owner. The price for a 3-by-5-foot double-hung window, for example, can range from $500 to $1,400.YOUR HOME</text></article><article id="1832211"><summary>Celebrities and royalty mingle with ordinary people at Mahiki, trendy London nightclub; photo (M)</summary><text>ACCORDING to Polynesian mythology, Mahiki is the path that leads to Lua-o-Milu or, more simply put, the underworld. So it's rather fitting that a club that has often been a playground for the British monarchy's two young princes is named after the descent into decadence.Nearly every morning, the British papers run over with tales from Mahiki, this kitschy two-level court in central London's Mayfair district, like how much money Prince Harry and his friends spent (on one night last month, about $21,000), and which pop icons were spotted in the corner. (Madonna and Guy Ritchie reportedly spent two hours there discussing the state of African orphans with the prince, who will soon trade his clubgoing for military service in Iraq.)Though the prince was recently whisked out the back door after a fight started outside, this is not your typical A-list club.The club, which opened in November, draws a fancy crowd, but there's no velvet rope, so royals, socialites and average Nigels commingle here amid Polynesian-theme shell chandeliers, bamboo walls, grass hut ceilings and, most of all, convincingly tropical drinks.Pi&#241;a coladas are served in large carved-out pineapples, and Coconut Grenades out of frozen coconut shells, giving everything an authentic, if rather Gilligan's Island, feel.''It's so not pretentious, it's fantastic,'' Stephen Lisseman, a fashion designer for Asprey, said of the club. He was celebrating the success of a fashion show with friends on a recent Friday night. The tiki lounge music, he said, ''is so bad that you don't have to worry about it.''Just behind him, faces were illuminated by a flaming shot glass of rum sitting in the middle of the Bikini Blast group drink, served in a watermelon rind full of pineapple and lime juices mixed with tequila. A young man struggled to blow out the flame while a woman beside him giggled.At Prince Harry's regular table in the center of the space, a large group nibbled on skewered chicken and mini-burgers. A waiter placed an antique treasure chest on their table, opening it to reveal a mystery brew served over mounds of ice and decorated with sliced fruit and tropical flowers. With a flourish of the wrist, the waiter doused it in Champagne, and the group did their best to out-sip each other through foot-long straws, taste-testing what has come to be known locally as a favorite of the princes (and those with princely bank accounts).''I had read about it recently in the press, as it would seem it's a regular haunt of the two princes, and we thought the tropical cocktails sounded as though they might make for an interesting evening,'' said Tor Leckie, 31, who lives in the Hammersmith section of West London.

But in his personal life, he kept an even longer list -- the qualities he sought in a girlfriend. An abridged version would include: brainy, creative, humble, funny, confident and energetic enough to go out every night. And one more thing: ''Hot. That was important.''He felt it was a pretty impossible hunt. ''I was really wondering if I was ever going to find all of the things I wanted and needed in one person,'' he said.Mr. Heilner, who is 35 and commutes from his Brooklyn apartment to the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, where he is teaches photography, looks like a rock musician. He wears jeans and striking sneakers and he's built like Paul McCartney, so sprightly he could practically fit into a guitar case. When friends inquire how he's doing, his answer is always the same: ''Busy.''Plans and details are important to him. ''He knows exactly how many steps are in every subway station he uses,'' said Justine Heilner, his sister.For his annual June scavenger hunts, he invites about 25 friends and friends of friends. They form teams and make video recordings of themselves as they track down a piece of the Berlin Wall in Midtown or convince strangers to recount, on camera, how they lost their virginity.In 2003, a friend took Amy Scott to Mr. Heilner's hunt. Ms. Scott is a senior reporter for ''Marketplace,'' a business program on public radio that is freewheeling enough to cover topics like Trader Dater, a matchmaking service for bond traders. On that hunt, she spoke only briefly with Mr. Heilner. He was busy, of course. And he had a girlfriend. But after that, he started listening to her show.Ms. Scott, now 32, is businesslike, ladylike and hippielike all at once. A vegetarian, she grew up in Colorado Springs and has had many adventures, including a radio job in Alaska where she often reported on places reachable only by bush plane.In 2005, she again attended Mr. Heilner's hunt. This time, he was unattached and much friendlier. ''He came right up to me with a big smile on his face,'' she recalled. ''It was unseasonably warm and he took his shirt off and I thought, 'This guy's pretty cute.' '' After the hunt, everyone gathered in a downtown tavern. ''I put songs on the jukebox that I thought he would like,'' she said. ''It's safe to say I was in seduction mode.''They talked. He learned that Ms. Scott had a CD collection almost as large as his, loved revolving restaurants and cross-country drives (both passions of his) and lived near him in Brooklyn. She asked him for a ride home and they ended up sitting outside her apartment, talking. ''I knew it was something big,'' he recalled.A few nights later, Mr. Heilner invited her over for a tofu-and-vegetable dinner, which they ate on the couch while he played his favorite '80s rock songs for her.It was a great date, but she felt skittish after years of romances that ended like country songs. ''I think I knew he was someone I could love for a long time,'' she said. ''But I shoved those feelings away and tried to be prepared for whatever disaster was in store for me.''But Date No. 2 was also great: They went to Coney Island and rode the Cyclone, then hung out in a nearby dive bar listening to a Journey cover band. He was amazed that she knew every lyric to every song the band played. And she could discuss politics, Wall Street and how to pitch a tent.''Rather suddenly, it became clear to me that everything I wanted was there in one package, that no piece of the puzzle was missing,'' Mr. Heilner said.After a few road trips together that summer, she knew she wanted to marry him. ''He has no pretense,'' Ms. Scott said. ''He doesn't care about what he's wearing but he still looks stylish. He hugs friends, male and female alike. He's an incredible communicator. We can talk about anything. He never clams up or walks out.''For their March 3 wedding in an evergreen forest at La Foret Conference &amp; Retreat Center in Colorado Springs, Ms. Scott wore a sleeveless gown and wildflowers in her hair. Mr. Heilner chose a slim black suit reminiscent of the early Beatles. They married themselves, which is allowed under Colorado law, in an adobe chapel filled with candles and young couples, many carrying babies and cameras.In their vows, they spoke like people returning from a successful scavenger hunt. ''I'm so glad I found you and you found me,'' the bride exclaimed, adding: ''I trust that I can count on you more than I've ever counted on anything before. I promise to be faithful. I will always come home.''WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS</text></article><article id="1832238"><summary>Leonello Borghi designs line of canvas bags for men; photo (M)</summary><text>Extravagant men have been seen about town with Leonello Borghi's extravagant fur bags, made of sheared mink and coyote and costing upward of $2,000 each.

This is the quintet that takes fierce pride in being dubbed a ''bar band,'' (from Brooklyn, no less) and whose refrain ''gonna walk around and drink some more'' from the song ''Party '' is often taken as a direct order by the group's mostly male fan base.Last Sunday, the band sat around and drank some more -- in this case, sake -- perched on stools at Momofuku Noodle Bar in the East Village.''I love your look right now,'' Galen Polivka, who plays bass, said jokingly to Tad Kubler, the guitarist. The two men were wearing identical black wool sweaters with collars peeking out.Mr. Kubler raised one eyebrow from beneath his pink-tinted aviator glasses. ''My style icon for the next three years is Robert Redford in 'Three Days of the Condor,' '' he said.A plate of six Canadian oysters on a bed of dark green seaweed appeared.''I think you can eat that underneath stuff,'' Mr. Kubler said, gesturing with one chopstick. ''It's kelp, what whales eat.''''You're thinking of plankton,'' said Franz Nicolay, the band's pianist, who sports a mustache that twirls up on each end, similar to the cartoon villain Snidely Whiplash.After releasing three albums in three years, the Hold Steady struck gold with their release last year, ''Boys and Girls in America,'' selling more copies (52,000 and counting) than its previous two albums combined. It has been a steady ascent since: the band has landed on Letterman's stage and was named Blender magazine's ''Band of the Year'' in the January-February issue this year.The band's success has come at a point when most aspiring rockers are gearing up for a midlife crisis -- the average age of its members is 32 -- but it works.''If we were 19, the label would have a much tighter hold on us,'' said Craig Finn, the lead singer, who was enjoying his ramen noodle soup with an egg on top. ''Because we're old guys, we can go in any direction musically. We don't have to answer to anyone.''Mr. Finn's style of speak-singing in a nasally growl over powerful guitar chords and beautiful piano melodies is not for everyone, and he admits as much.''A kid came up to us in Vancouver and asked what it was like to be in a cheesy 70s rip-off band with a lead singer who can't sing,'' he said.Walking around the corner to Hi Fi, where Mr. Polivka tends bar between tours, the guys erupted in laughter when their song ''Stuck Between Stations'' began playing.''Who put on this?'' said Bobby Drake, the drummer.As they passed around Budweisers, talk turned to the antismoking laws in New York. The band had just returned from its first European tour, where Mr. Kubler had been horrified to see people in Germany smoking in restaurants.''They got ash in their food and went right on eating,'' he said.''I, however, loved it,'' said Mr. Polivka, who subsequently ducked outside for a Camel Light.In a few days, the band would head out on a brief national tour. Though their schedule is picking up speed, the members have yet to quit their day jobs -- among them photo assistant and auto mechanic.''We'll stay on the road for as long as possible,'' said Mr. Finn, taking off his black glasses and squinting at the neon light emanating from a nearby jukebox, ''so we don't have to go back to real work.''A Night Out With Hold Steady</text></article><article id="1832244"><summary>Bill Cunningham On the Street photos of men strutting about in their own unique Beau Brummell styles</summary><text>In an era of big-brand sameness, a few men are ruffling their feathers.

Owned in part by Lynn Wagenknecht, the ex-wife of Keith McNally, Cafe Cluny shares roots with Odeon, Cafe Luxembourg, Balthazar and Pastis. It's more bistro than brasserie, tucked into two low-ceilinged rooms that trade swagger for a gentle prettiness that's charming on first sight.Like Cafe Cluny's scale, its dinner menu is modest: half a dozen appetizers, eight entrees and a smattering of sides and desserts. One of the best entrees is roasted cod, buttery in texture, with a hearty mash of polenta and piperade.EXTRA VIRGIN  (212) 691-9359; 259 West Fourth Street (Perry Street); $$; $25 and Under: 9/8/04.

Brodsky claims in ''The Legislature You Don't Know'' (Op-Ed, March 4), most New Yorkers aren't fed up with our state legislators because they don't keep us sufficiently informed regarding all the wonderful things they are doing.Rather, we are dismayed that they act as mere rubber stamps for the leaders of their respective houses -- the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver -- and, most recently, because they went back on their word to Gov. Eliot Spitzer and insisted on putting an unqualified crony of theirs, Thomas P. DiNapoli, in charge of the state's finances.I also doubt that most New Yorkers would agree that our state legislators ''provide ordinary people access to power.'' I've never so much as glimpsed my assemblyman, Daniel O'Donnell, around the district -- and I've yet to receive an answer to the e-mails I sent to Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Brodsky, or Mr. Silver regarding their votes for Mr. DiNapoli.Kevin Baker  Upper West SideTo the Editor:Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky defends the independence of his branch while omitting any reference to its craven performance in appointing an egregiously unqualified legislative colleague as state comptroller.I used to think that Gov. George E. Pataki was the problem with Albany. It is now clear that the two legislative leaders and those who follow their orders are at least equally responsible for New York State's dysfunctional government. I prefer Gov.

Still, Ms. Southwick, an agent with a keen eye and a wicked tongue, is moved to pull out her ever present tape measure. Chloe's hips have grown to a 36 1/2 from a 35. Not good.''You're like the Pillsbury doughboy,'' Ms. Southwick says, grabbing at the aspiring model's soft midsection.

The show offers an unflinching look at the lives of modeling agents, who scout, mold and sell the young beauties that populate billboards, commercials and the pages of magazines.The office, buzzing with a cacophony of ringing phones and frenzied, clipped conversations, feels at times like a college dorm. Hopeful young women often lack a certain get-up-and-go, seeming more inclined to pout than take advice. The bookers curse at every turn; Ms. Southwick whines about, well, everything; an assistant booker, Lola Milligan, is shown in one episode sleeping off a hangover at her desk.Unlike other reality TV series about the modeling business, which tend to be coated in copious amounts of sugar, there are no soft coos of reassurance from Tyra Banks or tempered criticisms from Heidi Klum. ''The Agency'' serves it up raw.But does the series really portray the vagaries of the business accurately? Reactions from the industry were mixed, with some insiders saying that agents often develop very close relationships with girls they've nurtured. But the insiders say agencies often employ a mixture of kid gloves and brutal critiques to get the best from their models. Two executives at rival modeling firms, however, said the show's bitchiness was exaggerated, though they would not speak for attribution.One veteran agent called the show, ''overdramatized'' and said it perpetuated negative stereotypes about the fashion industry. ''No one is ever that harsh,'' he said. ''Yes, when we're dealing with models, we're to the point, but it's not about humiliating or laughing at people. We are professionals.''Another modeling manager at a top-tier firm described the show as a public relations gaffe. ''Hey moms, entrust your daughter in my care, so I can constantly tell her how fat she is, how her nose is big, how her skin is bad,'' he said. ''I guess it makes for good television, but it doesn't make good business sense to me.''Sean Patterson, the president of Wilhelmina, had a quick response: ''Anyone who believes that this isn't real'' is out of touch. He was in his office with several of the cast members discussing the show's veracity.Greg Chan, another booker, said he is often asked if the show is scripted. ''We don't have time to learn lines,'' he said. ''Trust me, we're not actors.''One former model also attested to a harsher reality. Amanda Kerlin, an author of the novel ''Secrets of the Model Dorm,'' has not watched the show, but said that while she worked in the industry, weekly measurements were not uncommon, especially during the time leading up to Fashion Week.''After a while it messes with your psyche,'' she said. ''Some girls chose to starve themselves or took drugs to keep the weight off. A lot of girls develop bad eating habits. Some girls will have one Big Mac a day, smoke Marlboros and just drink a lot of coffee because it boosts your metabolism.''On the show, the person who does most of the critiquing is Ms. Southwick, the delightfully acerbic hitwoman who has become the character to watch.Brian Graden, president for entertainment at the MTV Networks Music Groups, which includes VH1, said that at parties, his version of a pop culture litmus test, people have mentioned her repeatedly. ''They remember Becky, which is usually a good sign,'' he said.That's no surprise to Ms. Southwick. ''I'm the best one on the show to be quite honest,'' she said. ''If I wasn't on the show, it wouldn't be as good.''Sarah Raimo, who works in New York for the public relations firm Full Picture, said she watches it just to see what Becky is going to say next. ''She's so unremorseful and I think it's hysterical. They hit the jackpot with her.''Ms. Southwick and her takedowns are featured prominently. In Episode 2, she writes off a hopeful because of her chin. ''It's like Jay Leno's,'' she bellows. ''Her chin looks like a canoe.''ALREADY, Ms. Southwick is being compared to another mouthy Brit with a granite heart, Simon Cowell. ''It's a compliment, because 9 1/2 out of 10 times he's right and 9 1/2 out of 10 times I'm right,'' she said. ''Love me or loathe me, most people will agree I'm telling the truth.''But Ms. Southwick, who after three years at Wilhelmina now works at Trump Model Management (Episode 7 has more on that story), is not the show's only acid tongue.The first episode opens with Pink, a portly man covered in tattoos, slicing through a group of aspirants with the precision of a ninja. One attractive brunette is dismissed with a terse: ''Hi, you're too old and you're too short.'' A blonde with teeth that look like moving piano keys is told: ''Your smile is off, and if your smile is off you can't make money.'' And still another stands in horror as she is methodically dissected. ''Your face is asymmetrical, your eyes are too close together, your nose is off at an angle,'' Pink says. ''Do you want me to keep going?'' Subtle he is not. Pink, who is as quick-witted in real life, remained unapologetic. ''Do you want someone who is going to be nice, or honest with you?Though the show is by no means a runaway hit like ''Flavor of Love,'' it has a modest following; the show had more than 800,000 viewers last week, up 84 percent from the previous week. Michael Hirschorn, executive vice president for original programming and production at VH1, said character-driven shows like this ''have to build,'' but he was happy with its performance. The series is the brain child of Mr. Patterson, who is also an executive producer and the show's level-headed papa bear. He would not disclose financial details of the deal with VH1, but said he was happy with the arrangement.Mr. Patterson believes the show's unabashed honesty is a good thing, a form of public service even. ''There are so many delusional people in this world that think they can actually be models,'' he said.''They'll spend years of their life and an inordinate amount of money getting test shots done or working with some scam agency, pursuing something that they never had a chance to succeed at.''Capitalizing on the show's visibility, Mr. Patterson said he is aggressively revamping Wilhelmina's high-end women's division, which over the years has diminished in stature. James Scully, a fashion show casting agent, said Wilhelmina's high-end men's division is considered in the top five, if not No. 1, in the business, while its women's division is ''not even in the top 10,'' lagging far behind agencies like IMG Models (home to Kate Moss and Gisele B&#252;ndchen).Founded by Wilhelmina Cooper in 1967, the agency enjoyed great success in the '70s and '80s. Competition increased in the '90s, when more upstart agencies entered the market and Wilhelmina's luster began to fade. It once handled the careers of supermodels like Lauren Hutton and Iman, but now has few high-profile women.Mr. Scully thinks the show can help change the agency's fortunes: ''If done right it could be a boon.''It already has been, Mr. Patterson said. . Since the show made its debut, the agency has been deluged with e-mailed photo submissions and phone calls -- about 1,000 more a week. At a recent open-call audition for the company's children's division, the line wrapped around the block. ''We usually get about 50 to 60 people,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''This time it looked like a rock concert outside.''Lorri Shackelford, another agent, said she has received several calls from clients requesting models that have appeared on the show. ''People I haven't talked to in years,'' she said, ''have been reaching out to me.''</text></article><article id="1832331"><summary>New Jersey Transit says computer glitches in recently-introduced locomotives caused numerous delays last year (S)</summary><text>Computer glitches in recently introduced New Jersey Transit locomotives caused numerous delays for commuters last year after the software forced the engines to shut down frequently, the agency said.The diesel and electric engines, known as PL42's, operate on the Bergen, Main and Pascack Valley Lines and are able to pull the new double-decker trains introduced last year, said Penny Bassett-Hackett, a spokeswoman for the agency.The engine computer controls all transportation functions, which sometimes get jumbled, causing the system to reset. In 2006, after the PL42's, which cost about $5.3 million each, had been introduced, New Jersey Transit reported 322 delays involving locomotives on the three lines, up from 192 in 2005. The average delay was about 15 minutes.''With any new equipment there is a break-in period, and that's what we experienced with the PL42,'' Ms. Bassett-Hackett said, adding that the locomotives were examined extensively on test tracks before going into use. ''It's not until you put them into real-life experiences, pulling all types of equipment, where you can see where the issues are.''Ms. Bassett-Hackett said the necessary repairs fell under warranty and the locomotives had been performing better so far this year. There are 33 PL42's in use by New Jersey Transit, and nearly all have been debugged. Eventually, she said, there will be fewer delays than with the old equipment.JOHN HOLLTHE WEEK</text></article><article id="1832334"><summary>Nina Eckhoff letter on March 4 letter on super real estate agents</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Super Agents, Super Teams'' (March 4):As a former advertising manager of a real estate agency, I can tell you that people do not need real estate agents to sell their homes or other properties.My family sold a $1 million property in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., in 2004.

But probably just one has inspired enough of his countrymen to take up the game that the country became a world chess power. That is Viswanathan Anand of India.Anand, who for a decade has been among the world's top three players, was the first Indian to earn the grandmaster title. He won the world junior championship in 1987 and the World Chess Federation championship in 2000. He also played a memorable 18-game match for the world title against Garry Kasparov atop the World Trade Center in 1995.He has won all of the world's regularly scheduled major tournaments at least once.India now has two players in the top 20 and three in the top 35. Parimarjan Negi, 14, the world's youngest grandmaster and the second youngest in history, is from India.One extraordinary aspect of Anand's style is how quickly he plays. Even in complicated positions, he rarely, if ever, uses all of his allotted time. This has allowed him to win most rapid events he has entered and to be generally acknowledged as the world's best rapid player.Anand clinched the Morelia/Linares tournament yesterday, the second time he won what some call the Wimbledon of chess competitions.In Round 10, Anand beat Magnus Carlsen of Norway for the second time in the tournament. (Every player faced every other player twice at Morelia/Linares.).The opening was the Ruy Lopez, named for a 16th-century Spanish priest. It has remained one of the most popular openings to this day because of its myriad complexities.Instead of 13  g6, most people have played 13 f5, striking at White's center while he is not fully developed.Anand's 14 b4 was played by Peter Leko, another competitor in the tournament, against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov last year. In that game, which ended in a draw, Leko went on to play 17 Bh6, which looked active but ended up doing nothing constructive. Instead, Anand tried 17 Bb3 to attack Black's knight.Carlsen's 22  Na8 looked terrible, but it was necessary to keep Anand's queen and rook from penetrating Black's position.With Carlsen's pieces now badly coordinated, Anand switched his attention to the kingside, playing 24 Bg5 to try to remove a key defender.Carlsen missed the danger signs and played 25  Rc8, removing another piece from protecting his king.After 27 Ne6, Carlsen could have tried to take the knight, but 27  fe 28 de Be8 29 e7 Kg7 (not 29  Bf7 because of 30  Qh6) 30 Qd5 Rc4 31 Bc4 Qc4 gives White an edge.Still, that would have been preferable to what happened.At the end, Carlsen's position was indefensible (38  Re8 39 Qf6 Qe7 40 Bg8 Rg8 41 Qe7), so he gave up.CHESS</text></article><article id="1832361"><summary>Photo of demonstrators in Madrid protesting house arrest of Basque separtist Jose Ignacio de Juana Chaos</summary><text /></article><article id="1832392"><summary>Correction of Feb 25 article about director and artist David Lynch</summary><text>An article on Feb. 25 in T: Women's Fashion magazine, about the director and artist David Lynch, rendered the title of a 1923 book by Robert Henri incorrectly.

It never was. It was formed in 1998 to provide an alternative for Democrats, Republicans and independents to get away from partisan politics and sponsor candidates of integrity in local elections.At the time, the Democratic Party had put forth a mayoral candidate. Bill Sherwood and I, having served with him as fellow trustees, were convinced that his election as mayor would be disastrous for the village. We founded the Dobbs Ferry Party.In subsequent years the community continued to agree with our vision that the village would be better served by searching out and putting forth the best candidates, regardless of their national affiliations. As Brian Monahan, a former mayor, once told me, ''There is nothing Republican or Democratic about a broken sewer or a pothole.''To my knowledge, the Dobbs Ferry Party never favored development. It did sponsor candidates who understood that, given existing state and federal law, the only sure way to stop development was to buy properties before they fell into developers' hands -- a course, unfortunately, out of reach of village funds.Martin Greenberg  Somers</text></article><article id="1832407"><summary>Nina Eckhoff and Stephanie Lecker Sherman letters on March 4 article on super real estate agents</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Super Agents, Super Teams'' (March 4):As a former advertising manager of a real estate agency, I can tell you that people do not need real estate agents to sell their homes or other properties.My family sold a $1 million property in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., in 2004.

Their deer-vehicle collision rate was not reduced during that period.There are proven methods to reduce accidents. The use of Strieter-Lite reflectors has been effective in 11 states and can reduce collisions by 78 to 90 percent.Ottawa successfully reduced collisions by 20 percent through a public education campaign called ''Speeding Costs You Deerly.''

In the gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's ''Talk Radio,'' which opened last night at the Longacre Theater, Mr. Schreiber's presence seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather. You get the feeling that even if you shut your eyes and plugged your ears, he would still be gnawing at your senses and manipulating your mood.Well, that's how God is supposed to be, right? Omnipresent, invasive, all-seeing. And Mr. Schreiber is playing Barry Champlain, an abrasive radio talk show host who, as another character puts it, has seen the face of God -- ''in the mirror.''In the course of ''Talk Radio,'' set during one eventful night broadcast in a Cleveland studio, Barry will be forced to confront another, less august image of himself, offered up by the sort of lonely, angry people who regularly phone in. What Barry glimpses allows Mr. Schreiber to provide the most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting.Directed by Robert Falls, who provides a solid frame for his incandescent leading man, this revival may not make a case for Mr. Bogosian's 1987 drama as a play for the ages. The rotting United States decried by Barry looks almost wholesome 20 years later. But like the original production, which starred Mr. Bogosian as Barry, it allows its star to grab an audience by the lapels and shake it into submission. Anyone familiar with Mr. Schreiber's stage work -- whether in Shakespeare, Pinter or Mamet -- will regard this opportunity as a privilege.With ''Talk Radio'' Mr. Schreiber, who won a Tony two years ago for his performance in ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' confirms his status as the finest American theater actor of his generation, a man capable of presenting clouded, complicated minds with searing clarity. His performance here is unnervingly physical as Barry's malaise of the soul translates into all manner of bodily discomforts.Yet the insight and technique that shape this downward slide are never slipshod. You are always subliminally aware that Barry's losing control is mapped by someone who will never lose control as an artist. A good but less dazzling screen actor, Mr. Schreiber offers a balance between intelligence and instinct, both invigorating and reassuring, that is made for the theater. You know you're in the hands of the ultimate professional.This puts Mr. Schreiber's Barry in stark contrast to that of the more intuitive Mr. Bogosian, who made his name as a wild and crazy performance artist and who whipped through ''Talk Radio'' in a roller-coaster rush of adrenaline. Mr. Schreiber's take is more analytical, taking us through one man's inner hell as a sort of Dante-esque tour where you're made conscious of each level of discontent.Mr. Schreiber's careful lucidity shines light on inconsistencies and creaky dramatic tricks that you might not have noticed before, including the redundant use of Barry-explaining monologues by others, describing traits fully evident in Mr. Schreiber's performance.At the same time, though, Mr. Schreiber brings out what was most prescient about ''Talk Radio.'' I don't mean its screeds about a culture in which, as Barry disgustedly tells his listeners, ''your fear, your own lives, have become your entertainment.''Mr. Schreiber's Barry is an incisive study in a subject that has since become the stuff of endless analysis: the pathology of fame, of what happens to someone who sees himself reflected and distorted in the eyes (or in this case, ears) of multitudes. (Madonna was at the performance I attended, and it was hard to avoid wondering what she made of it all.) Being God, after all, is a big burden.How Barry perpetuates his egomania is given bright, fast life in Mr. Falls's production, which runs 100 intermission-free minutes. Mark Wendland's set, which isolates Barry from his co-workers by a glass wall, ideally underscores the sense of the studio as a kind of cosmic control tower. And Mr. Schreiber's use of microphones is the best argument ever made for the use of artificial amplification on Broadway.Barry's mikes become biological appendages; he uses them as if they were vocal cords. The resulting sounds -- baritone purrs and snarls as Barry insults and cajoles (mostly insults) his philistine callers -- gleam with daunting authority.Then there's Mr. Schreiber's way with a cigarette, turning exhaled smoke into a forbidding wall. It matches the radioactive energy field of Barry's restlessness, fueled by infusions of coffee, Jack Daniel's and cocaine, the effects of which Mr. Schreiber registers with meticulous craftsmanship.The same exactitude comes across in the increasing evidence that Barry is made, after all, of very fallible flesh. Such commonplace afflictions as throat-clogging congestion and a running nose do battle with Barry's mellifluousness. His walk becomes shakier, more lopsided; his skin turns raw and mottled; tics flicker in his smooth, masklike face.''Talk Radio'' does have a plot of sorts that is intended to motivate Barry's breakdown. His station executive (played with knife-edged corporate blandness by the excellent Peter Hermann) tells Barry that he has aroused the interest of producers who want to take his show national. This night's performance will determine his future.Adding to the pressure are two co-workers -- a longtime friend (Michael Laurence) and a recent lover (Stephanie March) -- whom he has shut out from his life and who want readmittance. But Barry's real connection, and the source of the play's tastiest dialogue, is with his unseen callers, embodied by a host of protean performers who become a babel of disparate voices, from a white supremacist to an obsessive cat lover. There is also the woman who is afraid of her garbage, whose monologue of fear provides a backdrop for the show's most ingeniously theatrical scene.One of these voices materializes in person toward the end. That's the young stoner named Kent (the compellingly hyper Sebastian Stan), who provides the one instance when Barry is compelled to engage, instead of dismiss, another person in the flesh.Watch how amused contempt shades into appalled dismay on Mr. Schreiber's face as Barry listens to this babbling hedonist. It's Dr. Frankenstein looking at his monster. From that moment Barry's defenses are down. And Mr. Schreiber, with surgical finesse, delivers the frightening and illuminating vision of a man without his skin.Talk RadioBy Eric Bogosian; created for the stage by Mr. Bogosian and Tad Savinar; directed by Robert Falls; sets by Mark Wendland; costumes by Laura Bauer; lighting by Christopher Akerlind; sound by Richard Woodbury; production stage manager, Jane Grey; general manager, Albert Poland; technical supervisor, Neil A.

The role called for someone willing to pour a bucket of water over Mr. Miller's nude body.''You have to love performance art, really,'' Mr. Miller says, flashing one of his sly, ingratiating smiles.Mr. Miller, whose latest personal show is about falling in love and life on the road, may be one of the few who call themselves performance artists without any irony -- but that doesn't mean he takes himself too seriously. Coming of age in the 1980s, he was a founder of Performance Space 122 and helped pioneer a certain kind of politically passionate, confessional solo show that has since been done to death.Of course, he is probably best known for having his National Endowment for the Arts grant revoked in 1990 because of complaints from conservative politicians, and he still occasionally appears locked in that period. How many artists are still talking about Pat Buchanan's 1992 culture war speech?The title is a reference to the number of hotel beds he will have slept in if he continues his life as a touring performer for the next two decades. ''A horrifying statistic,'' he says, before describing the joy of spreading his fierce, ''homo-drenched'' stories to Santa Monica, Calif.; Cleveland; or some other city on his itinerary.The son of a traveling salesman, he muses eloquently about the atmosphere of hotels (''every hotel is a haunted hotel'') and waxes philosophic about the role of the bed in our lives. ''Our deep selves are forged on beds,'' he says.Dressed in a black tank top, shorts and sneakers, Mr. Miller looks as if he is ready for a game of pickup basketball. A faux bed is the only set, and he stands on top of it, pouncing from pose to pose with feline quickness. As a performer, he is a real pro, a savvy craftsman who knows the shape of a classic narrative and, if things break down, how to get a quick and dirty laugh.If anything, he can come off as a little slick. But his real weakness is for the cheap political shots (No more Nazi comparisons, please!), although the anger he expresses over homophobia or immigration rights for his partner is only fleeting.It's a hopeful show, and you are left with the impression that Mr. Miller is an eternal optimist, happy with his life and his mission to continue doing enlightened performance art. He has plenty more beds to sleep in, and he's looking forward to every one.''1001 Beds'' continues through March 18 at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1832621"><summary>Jason Zinoman reviews Tim Miller one-man show 1001 Beds; photo (M)</summary><text>Animated Soviet Propaganda From the October Revolution to PerestroikaA four-disc boxed set that includes both a two-hour documentary and six hours' worth of short films, ''Animated Soviet Propaganda'' opens a window on a lost art from a lost world. Animation began in Russia under the czars, with the morbid wit of Ladislaw Starewicz's stop-motion creations using the stiff little bodies of insects. (In ''The Camerman's Revenge'' a grasshopper uses a movie camera to catch his unfaithful mate in flagrante delicto.) But after revolution and civil war, film acquired a new importance to the state.With the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, Lenin proclaimed the cinema the most important of all the arts, presumably for its ability to communicate directly with the oppressed and widely illiterate masses; in that same year Stalin was named general secretary of the central committee and the Soviet censorship office was established -- two developments that did not facilitate the free exchange of ideas.For a while, though, Soviet cinema lived in a whirl of avant-garde experimentation, as do the earliest films contained in this compilation: ''Soviet Toys'' (1924), directed by Dziga Vertov (''The Man With a Movie Camera'') and reputed to be the first Soviet cartoon, and a 1924 episode of the series ''Kino-Pravda'' that pays tribute to the recently dead Lenin in 58 seconds of boldly modernist animation.That was also the year that Russian Futurism found its highest cinematic expression in Yakov Protazanov's visionary science-fiction spectacular, ''Aelita: Queen of Mars,'' which also appears to be the inspiration for one of the most bizarre and strikingly designed films in this set: ''Interplanetary Revolution,'' directed by Nikolai Khodataev, Zenon Komisarenko and Yuri Merkulov.Described in an opening title as ''The tale of Comrade Comintern, the Red Army Warrior, who flew to Mars and vanquished all the capitalists on the planet!!,'' this short film uses both cut-out animation (the style later made popular by ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'') and hand-drawn cell animation to create a harsh, violent and vulgar satire that suggests the political caricaturists of Weimar Germany, an impression reinforced by an early use of the swastika to identify particularly villainous characters.The film climaxes with a fierce spaceship and ray gun battle that blasts away the capitalist exploiters, as Lenin benignly beams down from a giant television screen.These same three directors are also represented by the two-reel ''China in Flames'' (1925), which protests European interference in Chinese affairs in the same stringent tones. The ''N. Khodataev Group'' is credited with the 1927 ''We'll Keep Our Eyes Peeled,'' about the mounting threat of war, at least as perceived by the Soviets, from the vampirish capitalists of Western Europe.This period of free experimentation did not last any longer than it did for Soviet live-action filmmakers. Just as Eisenstein and Vertov had fallen under suspicion and lost their artistic autonomy by the mid-1930s, so too the careers of Mr. Khodataev, Mr. Komisarenko and Mr. Merkulov dried up. None have credits after 1935, though all three lived into the '70s.What replaced radical aesthetics was, of course, the Socialist Realism favored by Stalin, a manner that matched up -- all too smoothly -- with the increasing naturalism of Walt Disney's animation style. The Soviet Disney appears to have been Ivan Ivanov-Vano. An experimenter in his early days (''Black and White,'' from the 1930s, is a devastating account of American racism, covered in a few boldly graphic images), Mr. Ivanov-Vano soon mastered Disney's anthropomorphic animals, painterly backgrounds and cozy, folklorish tone.Still venerated in Russia today for his twinkly 1952 feature, ''The Snow Maiden,'' Mr. Ivanov-Vano is represented here by ''Someone Else's Voice,'' a 1949 short that could easily pass for a Disney ''Silly Symphony'' except for its threatening undertone: When a magpie returns from a flight abroad and dares to warble some of the jazz music she has heard on her travels, the hearty peasant birds of the forest swoop down and rip her feathers out.''This fable has a moral,'' suggests the narrator, ''and not just for magpies.''Soviet animation style changed again with the thaw of the late '50s, and animators like Anatoly Karanovich (''Mister Twister,'' 1963) adopted the simplified, linear style made popular in America by UPA Pictures (of ''Gerald McBoing-Boing'' and the Mr. Magoo cartoons). The tone is darker and more embittered as ''Animated Soviet Propaganda'' moves into the '70s and '80s: Vladimir Tarasov's expressionistic ''Shooting Range'' imagines a Times Square where the unemployed are mowed down for sport.There is a lot to discover in this wide-ranging, well-documented anthology, produced by Joan Borsten in cooperation with Russia's leading animation studio, Soyuzmultfilm. (Kino International/Films by Jove, $89.95, not rated.)A Lizard in a Woman's SkinFor Western decadence at its most luridly entertaining, it's hard to beat Lucio Fulci's Italian thriller ''A Lizard in a Woman's Skin'' (1971), which has been reissued in an upgraded version -- a much better image, a few additional minutes of nudity and gore -- by Media Blasters. Mr. Fulci has a fierce following among gorehounds for his stomach-churning ''Zombie'' (1979), but this earlier effort relies more on suspense than on splatter.Florinda Bolkan (''A Brief Vacation'') is a wealthy Englishwoman whose dream that she has murdered the coke-sniffing, sexually omnivorous Swedish model next door has apparently come true. Mr. Fulci finds intelligent and expressive use for many of the most annoying mannerisms of '70s filmmaking -- the aimless zooms; the wobbly, hand-held panning shots; the rapid-fire, strobelike editing -- as he creates a radically unstable visual environment for the disintegrating heroine.Pucci colors explode from everywhere as Mr. Fulci's basic whodunit plot writhes through some surprising twists and turns. The score, it almost goes without saying, is by Ennio Morricone, and the disc includes both English and Italian-language versions.

A man in a bowler hat sits at one end of a long table reading a journal, a meat grinder at his elbow. A woman in a shawl sits at the other end, a menorah with three candles before her. Downstage a man is painting a piece of cloth, a mannequin in a full-length slip nearby.The woman lights the candles; the man begins to grind some meat; the painter drapes the cloth on the dummy and sits at the table. He says that while the table separates the actors from the audience, just as a writer is separated from his reader by the book, ''don't we hold each other's hand?'' The show pretty much goes downhill after that.''Republic of Dreams'' was put together by Stacy Klein, who also directed, and other members of the troupe. It is clearly intended as a homage to Schulz, who has acquired a sort of cult following that includes John Updike, the author of an introduction to an American edition of ''Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass.''Schulz was born in 1892 in Drohobycz, then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire and now of Ukraine. He trained as an architect, then turned to painting and later to writing. His day job was teaching drawing in high school. He was shot dead on a street by a Nazi Gestapo officer in 1942. He is now known primarily for two books: a story collection called ''The Street of Crocodiles'' in its English-language edition, and ''Sanatorium.''''Republic of Dreams'' (the title comes from an exhibition of Schulz's artwork that toured Poland in 2003) is a pastiche of scenes suggested by excerpts from his work, some of it mildly erotic, all of it profoundly surreal. The main problem is that there is no coherence in the succession of sketches: no narrative thread that could help an audience, especially one unfamiliar with his work, understand Schulz as an artist or as a man. It has the random feel of a highlight album of Schulz's greatest hits.Some of the passages from Schulz's writing are intriguing. Few writers in the last century are more worthy of being called Kafkaesque. But whether the jumble of scenes paraded onstage in ''Republic of Dreams'' will send many in the audience to find Schulz's books on Amazon.com is doubtful.None of the cast members seem very sure of characters they are supposed to be playing or have a clear sense of their objectives.Original music by Jacek Ostaszewski helps cover the tedium in a show that seems longer than its 50 minutes.''Republic of Dreams'' continues through March 18 at the Double Edge Theater at La Mama E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1832635"><summary>Edith d'Addario, 84, Joffrey S</summary><text>Edith d'Addario, for 43 years the director of the Joffrey Ballet School in Greenwich Village, died on March 4 in Brooklyn. She was 84.The cause was complications of emphysema, said her daughter Diane Green of San Francisco.Mrs. d'Addario, known to generations of dancers, students and their parents simply as Mrs. D, began her career at the Joffrey not long after bringing one of her daughters to classes at the school. Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino had only recently established the company, previously a touring ensemble, and the troupe and school were a hands-on affair. Mrs. d'Addario answered a ringing phone one day while waiting to pick up her daughter and her fate was sealed.She was appointed assistant to Joffrey and Mr. Arpino in 1961 and five years later was named executive director. In 1988, the year Joffrey died, she became simply ''director.''As the school's ever-present, plain-spoken doyenne, she also worked behind the scenes to expand several programs, including classes for children, pre-professional training and a summer intensive training project in four major cities across the United States.Mrs. d'Addario also established ballet classes for deaf children, helped form several junior touring ensembles and coordinated the casting of children's roles in the Joffrey Ballet productions of ''The Nutcracker'' and ''Petrouchka.''

Joseph Metcalf III, who in October 1983 was given less than two days to plan and start the controversial invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada after President Ronald Reagan issued orders to overturn a Marxist coup, died on March 2 at his home in Washington. He was 79.The cause was progressive neurological degeneration and two strokes, his wife, Ruth, said.The invasion of the island, which is 25 miles long and lies north of Trinidad and Tobago, started before dawn on Oct. 25, 1983. Six days earlier, a Marxist faction had toppled the government and executed the prime minister, Maurice Bishop. But even before the coup, Fidel Castro had sent more than 600 Cuban military personnel and construction workers to Grenada to build a 10,000-foot airport runway outside St. George's, the capital.Admiral Metcalf, commander of the Atlantic Second Fleet at the time, was placed in charge of what was code named Operation Urgent Fury. It took him 39 hours to deploy a force of 1,800 marines, 700 Army Rangers, 1,600 Army paratroopers and several dozen Navy Seal commandos. His deputy commander was Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who seven years later led the first American attack on Iraq.Within three days, American forces took control of Grenada and captured the coup leader, Bernard Coard, who had been the island's deputy prime minister; Mr. Coard remains in prison on the island. Nineteen Americans and 45 Grenadians were killed during the invasion, including 19 patients at a mental hospital that was accidentally bombed.The operation caused considerable controversy, particularly after journalists were barred from going ashore to cover the story. Critics charged that the administration had made misleading statements to bolster President Reagan's assertion that the invasion was necessary to prevent a Cuban takeover.The administration was accused of having inflated the number of Cubans on the island and exaggerating evidence that Americans in Grenada were in danger. There were approximately 1,000 Americans on the island at the time, including about 400 medical students. None were harmed.In 2002, in an oral history for the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, Caspar W. Weinberger, the secretary of defense at the time, defended the invasion, saying there was great concern ''that Cuba had been allowed to go too far and had become a threat.''''This construction was going on in Grenada,'' Mr. Weinberger said, ''and the government there was in complete anarchy. The American medical students were going to be an obvious target.''Admitting that there was faulty planning, Mr. Weinberger also said: ''We didn't have enough maps, and we didn't have this and that, and we didn't have very good communications between the various units. But it was very hastily put together, and we won.''Initial intelligence reports had indicated that there were 1,200 Grenadian regulars and 600 Cubans on the island. As the first helicopters swooped in, the only opposition came from a few snipers. But when resistance stiffened, the estimate of Grenadian forces was raised to 2,000 and the Cuban forces to 1,100. An additional 3,500 American paratroopers were rushed in.When Navy Seal teams came under heavy attack from Fort Frederick, outside the capital, they requested an air strike. An A-7 jet roared in. Soon after, much of the fort lay in ruins, including a wing of a 180-bed mental hospital.Admiral Metcalf was born in Holyoke, Mass., on Dec. 20, 1927, a son of Alice Conrad and Joseph Metcalf II. His father was a partner in a wool factory. In 1946, he enlisted in the Navy and a year later was admitted to the Naval Academy. He graduated in 1951, the same year that he married Ruth Daniels. Besides his wife, surviving are a brother, Conrad, of Westminster, N.C.; a daughter, Elizabeth Miller of Reston, Va.; 2 sons, David, of Wellington, Fla., and Joseph IV, of Knoxville, Tenn.; and 11 grandchildren.After the Grenada operation, Admiral Metcalf was named a vice chief of staff for naval operations.In 1985, it became public that Customs officials had stopped him and a staff member from bringing 24 Soviet AK-47 automatic rifles back from Grenada to distribute as souvenirs. The guns were surrendered, and Admiral Metcalf received a nonpunitive warning after saying he had not known that importing automatic rifles violated federal law.But nine lower-ranking servicemen were court-martialed and sentenced to hard labor for similar offenses. The secretary of the Navy, John F. Lehman Jr., later pointed out that some of the enlisted men had not only brought in the weapons, but also sold them.Admiral Metcalf rarely spoke about his Grenada experiences, his wife said, except to say that ''he thought it was a success, and it was.''</text></article><article id="1832647"><summary>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co will pay $6.9 billion to take discount retailer Dollar General private (M)</summary><text>Even the superrich go thrift-store shopping every once in a while.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, the giant buyout firm, said yesterday that it would pay $6.9 billion to take the discount retailer Dollar General private.The deal would be a very lucrative one for Dollar General shareholders, who would receive $22 a share -- a premium of nearly one-third over the stock's closing price on Friday. Besides the $6.9 billion price tag, the deal also includes assumption of about $380 million of debt.Shares of Dollar General jumped more than 25 percent yesterday to $21.07 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.Analysts said that in many ways, Dollar General was an ideal target for a private equity firm like Kohlberg Kravis. With 8,260 stores and sagging profits, analysts have said that the retailer would benefit from the type of consolidations that are common after a private equity buyout.''I think K.K.R. is probably looking at a company that is operating below its potential,'' Mark Miller, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Company in Chicago.Dollar General's earnings shrank in each of the last three quarters. In November, the same day it reported a $5.3 million loss for the third quarter, the company announced a restructuring plan that included closing at least 400 stores, scaling back plans to open new stores and repurchasing $500 million in stock.Mr. Miller said he thought the new owners would accelerate Dollar General's restructuring plans and would close even more stores. ''There's easily hundreds more,'' he said.A spokesman for K.K.R. would not comment on the possibility of store closings beyond the 400 Dollar General has already announced. K.K.R. issued a statement that said, in part, ''We support the strategic changes the company has under way and look forward to working with them to accelerate their progress and take advantage of growth opportunities in the market.''Rumors of a private equity buyout of Dollar General have been circulating for months. In November, the company's stock rose after news reports suggested that Bain Capital and Cerberus Capital Management were potential suitors.And yesterday, some analysts raised the possibility that additional bids could emerge. The fact that neither Bain nor Cerberus was part of the deal could prompt ''some speculation that other bids will emerge,'' said Scott A. Mushkin, an analyst at Bank of America.When the first Dollar General opened in Springfield, Ky., in 1955, its appeal was that it sold nothing that cost more than a dollar. Basic economics have since changed that, but about a third of its merchandise still sells for a dollar or less. It carries typical convenience-store fare like laundry detergent, groceries and beauty products.Because it caters to lower-income consumers, Dollar General has been particularly vulnerable to economic forces like gas price spikes and stagnant wage growth, which have hurt other retailers like Wal-Mart. With gas prices off their peaks of last summer and wages growing far ahead of inflation, analysts have raised their outlooks for retailers like Dollar General.''If you look out a couple of years, it's likely their customer fares somewhat better than they have been,'' Mr. Miller said.Goldman Sachs has agreed to commit debt financing, the companies said.Both parties expect the deal to close before the end of September.</text></article><article id="1832670"><summary>Photo of mourners at funeral for Shiite pilgrims killed by car bomb attack in central Baghdad</summary><text /></article><article id="1832671"><summary>Defense Dept confirms death of service member in Iraq (S)B</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,184 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

MULLANYTHE CAUCUS: IN THE RUNNING</text></article><article id="1832806"><summary>Jeannette Catsoulis reviews Oksana Dvornichenko documentary film A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich (M)</summary><text>A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer. Yet absent any kind of narrative discipline, the movie is ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject.Structured around a 1973 Soviet propaganda cruise to the United States that Shostakovich participated in two years before his death, this movie parallels the ocean voyage with his personal journey from child prodigy to bitter tool of the Politburo. Mixing Soviet propaganda films with snippets of symphonies and rare film of this composer at work, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life.Yet their approach is too scattershot to enlighten, and the archival film too often lacks context. As we jump back and forth from shipboard frivolities to ecstatic public adorations of Stalin, the movie's pleasures are episodic and random: synchronized street ballets performed by beaming girls in bathing suits, Paul Robeson singing a Russian folk song, Shostakovich confessing his hatred of movies and love of Guy de Maupassant.And if the composer's motivations remain murky, the triumphalism of his music so perfectly matches the aesthetics of Soviet agitprop that his beliefs seem almost beside the point. This is music for the masses.A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich  Opens today in Manhattan.Written and directed by Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer; narrated by George Watts and Ms. Landauer; director of photography, Juliy Olshvang; edited by Alexander Sokin and Vladimir Samorodov; produced by Ms. Dvornichenko and Darya Zhuk; released by Horovod in association with Turnstyle TV.

Desperate residents slip and slide over enormous snowdrifts to grab from the charred skeletons of bombed-out buildings whatever they can scavenge to use as fuel. On streets where all public transportation has halted, women fill pails with melted ice extracted from a hole in the snow.The siege that began on Sept. 8, 1941, when German troops surrounded the city and cut off its supply lines, continued through Jan. 27, 1944. After Leningrad's short-term stockpiles of necessities were exhausted, three million residents, subsisting on the most meager of rations, had to cope without fuel, water or electricity. During the unusually harsh winter of 1942, 200,000 died of malnutrition and exposure. Some estimate that 1.1 million had perished by the time the siege was lifted.The director has applied realistic sound effects to accompany these images, but the sounds are a background noise that seems to come from a distance, as if in a dream. Scenes of bombings are underscored with muted explosions, and fires by faraway sirens. As bodies are shoveled into mass graves, we hear muffled sobs of grief, but no actual words are heard. It all has a ghostly feel, like eerie murmurs during a s&#233;ance: the static of history heard on a short-wave radio.These pieced-together black-and-white sequences chronicle the deterioration of an austere, stately city into a snowbound graveyard of scarred buildings and numbed survivors. The only happy faces are seen at the end, when jubilant Russian crowds break into smiles after the siege is lifted, and gawk approvingly at the corpses of executed Germans displayed in a public square.Irina Gedrovich's ''Amateur Photographer,'' a 26-minute film assembled from materials found in K.G.B. archives, weaves snapshots taken by a German soldier, Gerhard M., with excerpts from his wartime diary into an episodic story of a typical German soldier (named Gerhard M.), dispatched to the Eastern front during the same period.The diary entries, which describe atrocities in an offhand, almost jocular style, are translated and read in English. The snapshot images reveal a landscape flattened by war, while the diary reveals a soldier doing his lethal duty without suffering pangs of conscience.At the end we learn that the diary landed its author in trouble when it was discovered by East German authorities. Gerhard M. was convicted by a Soviet court and executed in 1952.Blockade  Amateur Photographer  Open today in Manhattan.''Blockade'': written, directed and edited by Sergei Loznitsa; produced by Viacheslav Telnov.

One floor below, in a small soundproof studio, another instructor is teaching a youthful group of would-be rappers how to operate digital recording and video equipment.This is one of Brazil's Culture Points, fruit of an official government program that is helping to spread hip-hop culture across a vast nation of 185 million people. With small grants of $60,000 or so to scores of community groups on the outskirts of Brazil's cities, the Ministry of Culture hopes to channel what it sees as the latent creativity of the country's poor into new forms of expression.The program, conceived in 2003, is an initiative of Brazil's minister of culture, Gilberto Gil, who will be speaking on digital culture and related topics on Wednesday at the South by Southwest Music and Media Conference in Austin, Tex. Though today one of the country's most revered pop stars, Mr. Gil, 64, was often ostracized at the start of his own career and so feels a certain affinity with the hip-hop culture emerging here.''These phenomena cannot be regarded negatively, because they encompass huge contingents of the population for whom they are the only connection to the larger world,'' he said in a February interview. ''A government that can't perceive this won't have the capacity to formulate policies that are sufficiently inclusive to keep young people from being diverted to criminality or consigned to social isolation.''As a result of the Culture Points and similar programs, Mr. Gil said, ''you've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods.'' He added, ''It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role.''As the ministry sees it, hip-hop culture consists of four elements: M.C.'s (rappers), D.J.'s, break dancers and graffiti artists. At the Projeto Casulo, a community center here on a narrow, winding street at the foot of a favela, or squatter slum, all four art forms are being taught to dozens of young residents.''This program has really democratized culture,'' Guin&#233; Silva, a 32-year-old rapper who is the director of the center, said during a tour of its simple concrete building. ''We've become a multimedia laboratory. Getting that seed money and that studio equipment has enabled us to become a kind of hip-hop factory.''Though links to music run strong and deep in Brazilian culture, the notion of using taxpayers' money to encourage rap and graffiti art is not universally accepted. But because Mr. Gil's musical judgment is widely respected, the level of skepticism and resistance is lower than might be expected.''Gil still has to fight against other parts of the government in favor of things that everyone else there thinks are alienating junk, but he's willing to do that, whether it's on behalf of rap or funk or brega,'' another style of music considered vulgar and lower class, said Hermano Vianna, a writer and anthropologist who works in digital culture programs. ''He looks at that sort of thing not with prejudice, but rather as a business opportunity.''On the other hand, some important exponents of hip-hop culture in Brazil, like the rapper Manu Brown and the writer Ferr&#233;z, remain skeptical and have chosen to keep their distance from the government program. Others are participating but complain of the bureaucracy involved.''The idea is great because it has brought about a level of recognition we didn't have before,'' said the rapper Aliado G., president of an entity called Hip Hop Nation Brazil. ''But people get frustrated when a project of theirs is approved, and they can't get the money because they don't know how to do all the paperwork.''Brazilian rap, at least as it has developed in poor neighborhoods here in the country's largest city, tends to be highly politicized and scornful of lyrics that boast about wealth or sexual conquests. In contrast, the funk movement in Brazil, also imported from the United States but centered in Rio de Janeiro, is unabashedly about celebrating sex, bling and violence.''When U.S. rap groups come here and try to be ostentatious or do the gangster thing, they get booed off the stage,'' Mr. Silva said. ''We feel a kinship with Chuck D and Public Enemy'' -- known for their political commentary -- ''but we don't have any respect for people like Snoop Dogg and Puff Daddy.''Since established commercial radio stations and publishing houses have shown minimal interest in the music and poetry that new hip-hop artists are producing, or want to impose contract terms that are too stringent, rappers have developed their own channels to distribute their work. These range from selling their discs and books themselves on the streets and at shows to having the works played on a network of low-power but linked community radio stations.''There is an entire industry being built in the informal sector,'' Mr. Vianna said. ''If you were to apply all the laws in place today, no producer can release a record from a favela. So you have to create a new model, and Gil is willing to do that.''At the Projeto Casulo, the Culture Points program has produced a pair of documentaries about housing problems, complete with a rap accompaniment, that were broadcast on commercial television. The center has also generated a radionovela, a fanzine and a community newspaper and plans next to set up an online radio station to broadcast the rap songs that its musicians and those at similar community centers here have composed and recorded.In addition, a Culture Ministry grant enabled Hip Hop Nation Brazil to publish a book called ''Hip Hop in Pencil,'' a collection of rap lyrics. After a first edition of 2,000 copies quickly sold out in 2005 and was nominated for a literary prize, a conventional publishing house was interested enough to negotiate a deal to publish subsequent editions.''We had never before seen our story told in a book, and at first the publishing houses didn't take us seriously,'' said Toni C, one of the editors and authors of the collection. ''Books had always been used as a weapon against us, and people didn't know that such a thing as hip-hop literature existed. Now they do.''Brazilian law also offers tax breaks to companies that contribute to cultural endeavors like films, ballet and art exhibitions. Rap music has now been granted similar standing, and as a result, some of the country's largest corporations have begun underwriting hip-hop records and shows.At a recent event in Campinas, a city of one million an hour's drive from here, the sponsors included a power company, a bank, a construction business and an industrial conglomerate. As a troupe of break dancers strutted their most flashy moves, D.J.'s and M.C.'s railed against social, economic and racial inequality with lyrics like ''Reality is always hard/for those who have dark skin/if you don't watch out/you'll end up in the paddy wagon.''''It took a while for companies to wake up to the potential this offers,'' said Augusto Rodrigues, an executive of the power company and the director of the cultural center where the show was held. ''But there's a hunger for cultural programs like this, in which for the first time in 20 years, the ideology of the periphery can express itself.''</text></article><article id="1832835"><summary>Betty Hutton singer and actress, dies at age 86; photo (M)</summary><text>Betty Hutton, a singer and actress celebrated as a blond bombshell of Hollywood musicals and comedies in the 1940s and 50s, died Sunday night at her home in Palm Springs, Calif., her executor announced yesterday. She was 86.The cause was complications of colon cancer, the executor, Carl Bruno, told The Associated Press. He said the announcement of her death had been withheld until after her funeral, held yesterday at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City, Calif.Ms. Hutton, a brassy, energetic performer with a voice that could sound like a fire alarm, had the lead role in the 1950 film version of Irving Berlin's ''Annie Get Your Gun'' and a starring role in Cecil B. DeMille's 1952 spectacular, ''The Greatest Show on Earth.''She was known for her renditions of upbeat songs like ''Murder, He Says,'' a Jimmy McHugh and Frank Loesser number from the 1943 film ''Happy Go Lucky,'' and ''His Rocking Horse Ran Away'' from ''And the Angels Sing'' (1944).Ms. Hutton's electric presence in films like ''The Fleet's In'' and Preston Sturges's ''Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' masked emotional problems rooted in a poverty-stricken childhood. As a young girl, she sang for coins on street corners and in speakeasies to help support her alcoholic mother, who had been abandoned by Ms. Hutton's father.Years after Ms. Hutton's film career ended, those emotional problems still plagued her. ''I tried to kill myself,'' she said in 1983, recalling her decline after fading from public notice.Ms. Hutton re-emerged in the 1970s, when reporters learned she was working as a cook and housekeeper in the rectory of a Roman Catholic church in Portsmouth, R.I. Before being rescued and rehabilitated by a priest, she said, she had become addicted to sleeping pills and alcohol and had lost what she estimated to be a $10 million fortune.Betty Hutton was born Elizabeth June Thornburg in Battle Creek, Mich., on Feb. 26, 1921, the daughter of Percy Thornburg, a railroad brakeman, and Mabel Lum Thornburg. In the early 1920s, Mr. Thornburg left town with another woman, and Mrs. Thornburg took her children to Lansing and finally to Detroit, where she got a job in the automobile industry for 22 cents an hour. To make ends meet, she sold homemade beer to Prohibition violators. Betty and her sister, Marion, sang for the customers.Ms. Hutton quit school in the ninth grade and started earning money ironing shirts and doing housework. She also kept singing. When she was 15 and singing in a Detroit nightclub, the bandleader Vincent Lopez hired her and gave her the name Hutton. The band was also heard on radio. (Marion Thornburg later adopted the name Hutton, too, and became a vocalist with the Glenn Miller Orchestra; she died in 1987.)Ms. Hutton left Mr. Lopez's band after a couple of years and in 1940 appeared in the Broadway revue ''Two for the Show.'' Vogue magazine called her ''the most supercharged'' member of the cast. A year later she went to Hollywood at the invitation of B. G. DeSylva, executive producer at Paramount. He gave her, at 21, a part in ''The Fleet's In.'' Look magazine said it made her a star overnight.Her film credits in the next 15 years included ''Let's Face It'' (1943) and ''Here Come the Waves'' (1944). Sturges gave her more of a chance to act in ''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' (1944), a screwball comedy about wartime morality that ruffled censors with its story of a young woman who becomes pregnant after a spur-of-the-moment marriage and then can't quite remember who the father is.The next year she was back in a familiar role, as a hat-check girl, in ''The Stork Club,'' in which she memorably sang Hoagy Carmichael's ''Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief.''Several of her films were biographies: ''Incendiary Blonde,'' about the actress and nightclub queen Texas Guinan; ''The Perils of Pauline,'' about the silent-screen heroine Pearl White; and ''Somebody Loves Me,'' about the singer Blossom Seeley.In 1950, when Judy Garland was ill and unable to meet her commitments to star in the film version of ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' Ms. Hutton got the part, winning praise in a role that had been created on Broadway by Ethel Merman.There were also Hutton movies that got bad reviews, most notably ''Dream Girl'' (1948). Ms. Hutton began to feel her career was headed downhill. To help her get the romantic heroine's role in ''The Greatest Show on Earth,'' playing a trapeze artist, she sent DeMille a floral tribute 18 feet in diameter.But her career was winding down, and after ''Somebody Loves Me'' (1952), she was all but finished. That year she married Charles O'Curran, a dance director, who wanted to direct her in a film. Paramount rejected the idea, and Ms. Hutton, in a fit of temper, walked out of her contract. Her final film, ''Spring Reunion'' (1957), received little notice.Ms. Hutton soon turned to the new medium of television and was given a series, ''The Betty Hutton Show,'' but it lasted only for the 1959-60 season. In 1965 she appeared on Broadway in the musical ''Fade Out, Fade In,'' replacing Carol Burnett, but pills and alcohol were taking over her life.At her lowest ebb, in 1974, Earl Wilson, the columnist, organized a benefit for her in New York. ''I haven't got a cent,'' said Ms. Hutton, who had earned $150,000 a week in her good years.She found a way to cope with her problems in religion. She renewed her interest in Lutheranism, her original faith, then converted to Roman Catholicism. She regarded the Rev. Peter Maguire of St. Anthony's Church in Portsmouth as primarily responsible for saving her life. During one of her many hospital stays, he talked her into working for St. Anthony's. ''No one had ever talked to me before,'' she said.She later resumed work as an actress, appearing in nightclubs and, briefly in 1980, in the Broadway musical ''Annie.'' ''It's groovy being a star again,'' she said. ''But I know how fast it can be over.''In the early 1980s, Ms. Hutton, who had never gone beyond the ninth grade, enrolled at Salve Regina, a Catholic college for women in Newport, R.I. She earned a master's degree in psychology; the college had decided that her life experience entitled her to a bachelor's degree. By the late 1980s, she was teaching comedy and oral interpretation at Emerson College in Boston.She made occasional broadcast appearances in her later years, notably an hourlong interview, first shown in 2000, with Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies.She married four times, to Mr. O'Curran; Ted Briskin, a manufacturer; Alan Livingston, a recording company executive; and Pete Candoli, a jazz trumpet player. She had two daughters, Candy and Lindsay, with Mr. Briskin, and another, Caroline, with Mr. Candoli. All her marriages ended in divorce.''My husbands all fell in love with Betty Hutton,'' Ms. Hutton once said. ''None of them fell in love with me.''</text></article><article id="1832836"><summary>Ernie Ladd, hall of famer in football and pro wrestling, dies at age 68; photo (M)</summary><text>Ernie Ladd, a massive defensive tackle turned wrestler who was the only man elected to the American Football League Hall of Fame and the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, died Saturday at his home in Franklin, La. He was 68.The cause was colon cancer, which had spread to the stomach and bones, his son Rodney said.Ladd played 112 consecutive A.F.L. games in eight years, with the San Diego Chargers (1961-65), the Houston Oilers (1966) and the Kansas City Chiefs (1967-68). In the years before the A.F.L. merged with the N.F.L. in 1970, he played in three A.F.L. championship games and the first Super Bowl, in 1967, before becoming a full-time wrestler.Ladd was the largest player of his time: 6 feet 9 inches and 315 pounds, with a 52-inch chest, 39-inch waist, 20-inch biceps, 19-inch neck and 18D shoes. His quickness despite his size earned him the nickname Big Cat.In 1966, Sam DeLuca of the Jets, who at 6-2 and 245 pounds was hardly small, told The New York Times what it felt like playing against Ladd. ''Sometimes, he almost beats you on every play,'' DeLuca said. ''You wind up on the ground. If it wasn't for his size, I'd enjoy playing against him.''Ladd overpowered blockers until he abandoned football for wrestling. His professional wrestling career started when he was playing football.''After a few years, I was making so much money wrestling in the off-season that I figured I could make a lot more by giving up football and wrestling full time,'' Ladd told The Times. ''I quit football at 28 and still had several good years left. That first year wrestling, I made $98,000, and after that never made less than a hundred grand a year. That was big money back in the '60s.''In that era, as now, the outcomes of wrestling matches were scripted, and the good guys included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon and Bobo Brazil. They invariably won. Ladd was a villain and usually won, too. He said it was his idea to be a bad guy.''That's when the real fun began,'' he said. ''I was too big to get sympathy by getting beat on, so I made a much better heel.''He wrestled until 1986, when bad knees forced him to stop and to use a wheelchair most of the time. In later years, when he spoke at churches and prisons, he had to walk down stairways backward.Ladd, a native of Rayville, La., was reared in Orange, Tex. His high school coach was Willie Ray Smith Sr., the father of the College Hall of Fame football player Bubba Smith. Ladd attended Grambling State University in Louisiana on a basketball scholarship.He is survived by his wife, Roslyn; three sons, Ernie and Rodney, of Franklin, and Reginald, of Houston; a daughter, Erika Peters of Broussard, La.; 16 grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; two sisters, Jamesetta and Louella, both of Houston; and a brother, James, of Woscom, Tex.Ladd left lasting impressions on many people. According to ProWrestling.com, his football coach at Grambling, Eddie Robinson, once said: ''The first year he was here, he taught me a lesson. He told me how good he was. Sure, I'd say. Then he hurt somebody. I'd feel sorry for the people he was tackling.''Jon Morris, one of the top centers in the A.F.L., said that he was struck by Ladd's size. When he played head to head against Ladd, he said: ''It was dark. I couldn't see the linebackers. Couldn't see the goalposts. It was like being locked in a closet.''Correction:  March 24, 2007, Saturday  An obituary on March 14 about Ernie Ladd, who was the only man elected to both the American Football League Hall of Fame and the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, referred incorrectly to some of his football accomplishments. He did not play in the first Super Bowl in 1967, and he played in four -- not three -- A.F.L. championship games.</text></article><article id="1832837"><summary>John Thow, composer and professor, dies at age 57 (S)</summary><text>John Thow, a prolific composer of chamber, symphonic and stage works and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, died on March 4. He was 57.His death was announced by Diana Thow, his daughter, who said the cause was a chronic illness.Mr. Thow's music combined a modernist's approach to rhythm and harmony with an almost Romantic lyricism, and often -- in works like ''Trilce'' (1992) and ''Breath of Sun'' (1993) -- the music's interest lies in the tension between those contradictory impulses.In other scores, his interests ranged farther afield, and he had a particular fondness for Native American music. ''Lene Tawi'' (1996) is a chamber orchestra setting of a Hopi rain song. His ''Chumash Songs'' (2000) used rhythmic figures from the Chumash Indians of Southern California, and his ''Three Echoes'' (2001) is scored for a flute played by the Lakota tribe.Mr. Thow (the name rhymes with ''now'') also wrote an opera, ''Serpentina'' (1999), based on a story by E. T. A. Hoffmann; music for a production of Shakespeare's ''Much Ado About Nothing'' (1989); and a dance work, ''Rim of Heaven'' (1984), that was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival. He wrote copiously for solo voice and for chorus, and his large catalog of chamber works included scores in which Baroque instruments (wooden flutes and harpsichord, for example) were combined with modern ones. Critics often commented on his ear for vivid instrumental color.Mr. Thow was born in Los Angeles in 1949 and began his musical studies as a flutist and pianist. His composition teachers included Adolph Weiss, Frank Salazar and Ingolf Dahl. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Southern California in 1971, and a Ph.D in composition from Harvard, where he studied with Earl Kim and Leon Kirchner. He also won a Fulbright fellowship for study in Italy, where he worked with Luciano Berio, Luigi Dallapiccola and Franco Donatoni.He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1981, and was chairman of the music department from 1991 to 1992.In addition to Diana Thow, of Iowa City, Mr. Thow is survived by another daughter, Caroline Thow of Davis, Calif.; a brother, George Thow of Santa Rosa, Calif.; and his former wife, Peggy Thow.</text></article><article id="1832852"><summary>Photos of fashionable people in Times Square in 1970s and 2007</summary><text>Times Square is an unpretentious runway.

Called gestation crates, the cages virtually immobilize pigs during their pregnancies in metal stalls so narrow they are unable to turn around.Numerous studies have documented crated sows exhibiting behavior characteristic of humans with severe depression and mental illness. Getting rid of gestation crates (already on their way out in the European Union) is welcome and long overdue, but more action is needed to end inhumane conditions at America's hog farms.Of the 60 million pigs in the United States, over 95 percent are continuously confined in metal buildings, including the almost five million sows in crates. In such setups, feed is automatically delivered to animals who are forced to urinate and defecate where they eat and sleep. Their waste festers in large pits a few feet below their hooves. Intense ammonia and hydrogen sulfide fumes from these pits fill pigs' lungs and sensitive nostrils. No straw is provided to the animals because that would gum up the works (as it would if you tossed straw into your toilet).In my work as an environmental lawyer, I've toured a dozen hog confinement operations and seen hundreds from the outside. My task was to evaluate their polluting potential, which was considerable. But what haunted me was the miserable creatures inside.They were crowded into pens and cages, never allowed outdoors, and never even provided a soft place to lie down. Their tails had been cut off without anesthetic. Regardless of how well the operations are managed, the pigs subsist in inherently hostile settings. (Disclosure: my husband founded a network of farms that raise pigs using traditional, non-confinement methods.)The stress, crowding and contamination inside confinement buildings foster disease, especially respiratory illnesses. In addition to toxic fumes, bacteria, yeast and molds have been recorded in swine buildings at a level more than 1,000 times higher than in normal air. To prevent disease outbreaks (and to stimulate faster growth), the hog industry adds more than 10 million pounds of antibiotics to its feed, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates. This mountain of drugs -- a staggering three times more than all antibiotics used to treat human illnesses -- is a grim yardstick of the wretchedness of these facilities.There are other reasons that merely phasing out gestation crates does not go nearly far enough. Keeping animals in such barren environments is a serious deprivation. Pigs in nature are active, curious creatures that typically spend 10 hours a day foraging, rooting and roaming.Veterinarians consider pigs as smart as dogs. Imagine keeping a dog in a tight cage or crowded pen day after day with absolutely nothing to chew on, play with or otherwise occupy its mind. Americans would universally denounce that as inhumane. Extreme boredom is considered the main reason pigs in confinement are prone to biting one another's tails and engaging in other aggressive behavior.Finally, even if the gestation crate is abandoned, pork producers will still keep a sow in a narrow metal cage once she gives birth to her piglets. This slightly larger cage, called a farrowing crate, severely restricts a sow's movements and makes normal interactions between mother and piglets impossible.Because confinement buildings are far from cities and lack windows, all of this is shielded from public view. But such treatment of pigs contrasts sharply with what people say they want for farm animals. Surveys consistently find that Americans believe all animals, including those raised for food, deserve humane treatment. A 2004 survey by Ohio State University found that 81 percent of respondents felt that the well-being of livestock is as important as that of pets.Such sentiment was behind the widely supported Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which sought to improve treatment of cattle and hogs at slaughterhouses. But it's clear that Americans expect more -- they want animals to be humanely treated throughout their lives, not just at slaughter. To ensure this, Congress should ban gestation crates altogether and mandate that animal anti-cruelty laws be applied to farm animals.As a cattle rancher, I am comfortable raising animals for human consumption, but they should not be made to suffer. Because we ask the ultimate sacrifice of these creatures, it is incumbent on us to ensure that they have decent lives. Let us view the elimination of gestation crates as just a small first step in the right direction.Op-Ed Contributor Nicolette Hahn Niman, a lawyer and cattle rancher, is writing a book about the meat industry.</text></article><article id="1832859"><summary>Name of one American newly confirmed dead in Iraq; 3,185 American service members have died since start of war</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,185 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

Except in spirit.The crowd was there on West 45th Street to pay tribute to Vincent Sardi Jr., the unofficial mayor of Broadway and the owner of Sardi's, who died on Jan. 4 at 91.Inside the theater, the stage was set with a pair of cane-backed chairs around a tiny round table that was draped with a red and white checked tablecloth. A photograph of a smiling Mr. Sardi, larger than life-size, peered down at the audience. Visible behind him in the picture was one of the 700 or so famous caricatures that hang on the walls of the restaurant.Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization and the master of ceremonies for the event, strode onto the stage and took a seat at the table.''You may not see him,'' he said solemnly to the audience. ''But he is here.''The tribute began with a slide show of Mr. Sardi's life, moving from a childhood photo of him on a tricycle to adult scenes that highlighted his love of cars, horses and family.Mr. Schoenfeld presented the speakers and performers: Mr. Sardi's son David; the famed Broadway producer and director Harold Prince; the classical pianist Etsko Tazaki, who as a student at Juilliard was taken in by the Sardi family; and Bebe Neuwirth, who sang.''In my all my travels,'' David Sardi told the hundreds of invited guests and members of the public in the audience, ''I never fail to encounter people who, when they learn I'm a Sardi, have a story to tell about their experience at the restaurant, or in meeting my dad.''He added: ''To many it's the highlight of their trip to New York. And this is what I call the Vincent Sardi effect, and I marvel at it to this day.''Mr. Prince affectionately recalled that he got only two free meals at Sardi's, which he patronized for decades, and noted that he was one of those honored with a caricature. He held up the framed drawing to the audience, which included Neil Simon and Joyce Randolph, and, after pausing for dramatic effect, said, ''I have been hanging over the kitchen for 53 years.''Mr. Schoenfeld took a lead role in a skit about a diner at Sardi's, playing a producer whose waiter turns out to be an actor too eager for work to take Mr. Schoenfeld's order.The skit alluded to Mr. Sardi's well-known generosity with struggling actors: He let them run up tabs and often seated them next to a hiring producer. In this case, Mr. Schoenfeld's waiter, played by the veteran dancer and choreographer Donald Saddler in a faded red jacket, had won the promise of an audition by the time the curtain fell.Afterward, a crowd of more than 400 of the invited guests went over to Sardi's a block south for a reception. ''This was his kingdom,'' said Mr. Sardi's managing partner, Max Klimavicius, gesturing at the restaurant's caricature-covered walls. ''We wanted to make it fun and relaxed.''Sidney Zion, a New York writer and raconteur, sat at the bar and recalled his first time in the restaurant.''I opened the door, and there was Marlene Dietrich on the arm of No&#235;l Coward,'' Mr. Zion said. ''I said, 'This can't be!' ''Paula Lysak, who works in program operations at ABC, remembered her first trip as a young woman in the 1970s.''I had drinks at the Algonquin and dinner at Sardi's,'' she said. ''And you're sitting there having dinner, and oh, there's Ginger Rogers over there in the corner. That was the kind of restaurant it was.''And for a few hours yesterday, as the place filled with theater folk offering each other air kisses and theater fans looking on in awe, it was again.</text></article><article id="1832914"><summary>Correction of March 12 report on child labor in Guatemala, in light of Pres Bush's visit there; minimum wage is about $1 per hour</summary><text>An article on Monday about child labor in Guatemala, one of the five countries President Bush visited on a trip to Latin America, misstated the minimum wage there.

A cheerleading squad at a Florida retirement home, maybe, but not Her.''I didn't read the reviews,'' Madonna said on the phone the other day. ''I don't care what people say. I like them.''Next week Madonna gets a do-over as a celebrity designer.Blouses, wrap dresses, printed halter tops, corset belts and a turban -- all designed by Madonna! -- go on sale in H&amp;M's 1,300 stores on March 22. And, She wants you to know, real effort went into these clothes, like maybe She does care, just a little, about what people say.''Did they come and see my show?'' She asked, still on the subject of the mixed reviews. ''If they'd seen my show, they would cut me some slack about how simple my tracksuit was. I like the simplicity of it and live in my tracksuits.''But one cannot live in tracksuits alone. The new collection, called M by Madonna, has an unexpected vibe that could be described as landed-gentry Madonna goes office-casual Madonna.The degree of workplace appropriateness depends on whether one chooses to accessorize with pearls or a riding crop. Madonna, who chooses both, was inspired by the dynamic young women who work with Her, a group She calls the Semtex Girls, because, you know, they are like the explosive. Naughty!''They are the kind of clothes that mean business and fun all at the same time,'' Madonna said. ''I thought about what I like to wear every day.''Still, there will be Madonna fans (um, me) looking for something more emblematic of the many, many Hers. Like that bodysuit ($19.90) that speaks of ''Confessions on a Dance Floor''; or the double-breasted pantsuit (jacket, $99.90; pants, $59.90), circa ''Express Yourself''; or a long white dress ($69.90) that could have been a castoff from ''Vogue'' days. But no.''I didn't really think about anything in connection to the stages of my career or the evolution of my persona,'' She said.Not even the $34.90 corset belts?''Well, what part of my career didn't I have a corset in?''FRONT ROW</text></article><article id="1833021"><summary>Michelle Slatalla column on sites online that list condos, apartments and houses you can rent for vacation; drawing (M)</summary><text>THERE is nothing more terrifying than watching a child read a hotel dining room menu on the third morning of a vacation.As a chubby finger runs down the page -- $5 for toast, $15 for scrambled eggs, all my retirement savings for the full buffet -- I silently tally the cost of the previous days' half-eaten meals.I repeat a silent mantra. Please, not the orange juice, anything but the orange juice.The finger stops. It is pointing at the $10 million glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.''Are you sure you're going to drink all that?'' I snap.The child nods sweetly, takes one sip from the elegant stemmed glass and then skips off to the pool to investigate the possibilities of watching ice cubes melt in abandoned $12 Coca-Colas.When it comes to holding the line on costs for family vacations, I am a failure. How well I remember the Christmas of the $20 liquados (in Cabo San Lucas) and the summer of the untouched $15 apple juice frapp&#233; (Beijing) and the recurring nightmare, year after year, of the $9 banana-mango smoothies (Miami).Although I have developed two coping mechanisms -- I hide these expenses from my accountant and I vow, after every ruinous trip, never to repeat the mistake -- neither is effective at solving the problem.That's because I go into denial (no more summer vacations! Or Christmas trips! Ever!) until suddenly an uncontrollable urge strikes in, say, mid-November to book a trip in December. By then, of course, only the most ridiculously expensive vacations are left for last-minute planners and I find myself on a remote beach, about to purchase a $34 Caesar salad that none of my daughters will end up eating anyway because ''the sauce has black specks.''All my friends are smarter. They're always whisking their families off on fabulous vacations that cost next to nothing because, they say, they eschew hotels in favor of renting condos or apartments or houses they found on the Internet.While we were waiting in the carpool lane the other day, my friend Abby confided that she had just booked a London flat through aplacelikehome.co.uk to house her family of five this summer. Tom and Lisa just took their three children to Maui to stay in a condo they found on Mauiaplaceapart.com. And Jessica, who finds historic English cottages at www.nationaltrustcottages.co.uk, said an added benefit of this approach is that sometimes your children learn to milk cows. (And, the subsequent sips of milk are free.)Maddeningly, however, this approach has never worked for me. After I saw Tom looking relaxed and tan earlier this month, I rushed to the computer, only to learn that everything on Mauiaplaceapart.com was booked for the summer. Well, at least all the two-bedroom units that didn't have scary floral-print curtains, on all the possible dates that didn't conflict with our schedule.Similarly, when I widened my search to VRBO.com (which lists tens of thousands of rentals worldwide and is where my friend Tina found a house to rent on Oahu for a family reunion), I learned that it probably was too late to rent for this summer any of the places that caught my eye at locations that included the west side of Maui, or the north shore of Kauai near Hanalei, or even on the north shore of Oahu near Haleiwa.One problem with these sites is redundancy. Although much has been made of the great selection online these days, the truth is that many Internet rental sites' listings overlap.This can be confusing.It was only as I was composing an e-mail inquiry to vacationrentals.com that I realized that the site's listing No. 13132 ('' 'Old Hawaii' Garden Island paradise'') was identical to VRBO.com's listing No. 24936. (I'd recognize that green-frond pattern on the master bedspread anywhere.)Similarly, cyberrentals.com's ''Steps to Hanalei Bay'' ($2,250 a week, sleeps five) was the same as VRBO.com's listing no. 49105 (''hear the surf''), which I already had learned was unavailable.To be fair, it wasn't that everything already was booked for summer -- just everything that appealed to me for reasons of having a great location, or a great price, or a great view, or even other more idiosyncratic qualities like a recently renovated bathroom or a lack of floral patterns in the master bedroom.A rental agent who responded to my query about a beachfront house on Kauai (already booked!) suggested an alternative property nearby that had one minor difference: it overlooked a parking lot. On Oahu, a three-bedroom, three-bath beachfront house for $3,500 a week near Haleiwa was already booked too, but a more expensive alternative -- $5,250 a week -- was still available.I hesitated. At that price, the costs would be headed into the territory of a resort vacation.It was at this point that Tina -- my practical friend who holds the record for going the most years without allowing any of her children to order a club sandwich poolside -- came to my rescue with a plan designed to reduce costs while increasing options.''Let's rent a house together and go to Mexico in December,'' she said. ''We'll really be booking ahead.''So I started again -- with a destination of San Miguel de Allende and a goal of finding a house that could sleep 14, since my friend Amy and her family wanted to get in on the trip as soon as they heard Tina was organizing it.This time, I had more luck.Although the ''Authentic, Romantic Hacienda'' that ''sleeps 30-40'' for $10,400 a week was unavailable, at VRBO.com I found ''Villa Mariposa,'' with seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a heated pool and a reasonable price tag of $3,600 a week (be still my heart -- $1,200 a family).Tina took over from there, arranging with the rental agent to send a $1,000 deposit and to request menus for meals that a resident chef could prepare for an additional cost.The next challenge? Getting there. With 14 people and scant direct flights from Northern California to the nearest airport in Mexico, I probably would give up and suggest we all start walking today so we could arrive by Dec. 22. But I'm sure Tina, who has never uttered ''three banana-papaya smoothies, please,'' has another solution in mind.ONLINE SHOPPER E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1833025"><summary>Cathy Horyn article expresses satisfaction with fall fashion runway season just ended; photos (M)</summary><text>WHEN the fall runway season ended, a week ago Sunday, there seemed more to consider than to sweep aside. Rare was the first-tier show that clanged like an empty pot -- and you wouldn't have said that six months ago, when designers conjured up a cross between a Star Trek groupie and an Elvis impersonator. (See Steven Meisel's spread in February Italian Vogue for details.)It's hard to say what brought designers back to earth, but there's a good chance it was the bottom line. Clothes cost lots of money, a single garment the equivalent of a mortgage payment. There is only so much rationalizing available to a black wool jacket, however good the fit and self-esteeming the label, before a little voice cries ''Zara!'' and you're out the door.Jennifer Wheeler, the vice president for designer apparel at Nordstrom, suggests that women have learned to think of clothes in much the same way they do jewelry or fine art. ''They have to have an emotional reaction,'' she said. That sounds reasonable, or reasonable enough, but after hundreds of collections sprawled over four cities, how do you determine the real thing?If a woman walking past Bergdorf Goodman's windows last week felt cold-shouldered by the minidresses on display, she will certainly not want for ways in September to cover her behind. This is the biggest change. Fall clothes are longer and roomier if not always age-considerate.Marc Jacobs's tall-drink-of-water silhouette may recall Paris Vogue of the 1970s, when nearly every foot forward was a Maud Frizon, but the easy polish and hopeful palette of bright accents against gray and navy blue ought to strike a chord with women who always carry in their minds the figure they want to become. It's a romantic sensibility, to be sure, but Mr. Jacobs keeps it as cold and sparsely furnished as the classical villa that served as the backdrop for his show.If the collections of Jil Sander, Lanvin, Calvin Klein and Narciso Rodriguez seem just as self-assured and individualistic, it may be because these designers have developed a strong point of view that makes potential trends subordinate. As Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys New York, said, ''We buy designers, not trends.''In addition to making some exceptional dresses -- plain, sensual, with a single pressed-down pleat as the only detail -- Raf Simons, the designer at Jil Sander, offered capes that just graze the body and incorporate the details of a jacket. Other collections had capes and trapeze coats, but the difference is that Mr. Simons uses his to convey the message of a leaner, smartly polished look.''The strength comes from being exact,'' Ms. Gilhart said. ''If you're going to buy a cape, you're going to buy it from Jil Sander.''At Givenchy, Riccardo Tisci's neat jackets and wool sailor pants play the same mental game. Tailored trousers aren't a lingering thought of the collections, in part, Ms. Wheeler says, because ''leggings and skinny pants are still out there.'' (And, to reinforce that impression, Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga has added a new, slouchy variation on the khaki jodhpur.)But that's precisely why Givenchy's high-waist, wide-leg trousers (and those from Versace and Stella McCartney), should appeal to women. ''They make a statement on their own,'' Ms. Wheeler said.FOR Ms. Gilhart and other retailers, no collection summed up the season more energetically than Lanvin, designed by Alber Elbaz. For spring, Mr. Elbaz came up with a look that in its blunt use of wet-looking synthetics and hardware touched on futurism. The new collection still has that sharpness (or hardness), but, as Ms. Gilhart points out, it manages to cross divides of age and taste.''You have all that color and those amazing sleeves, so it's great for a woman who wants the glamour of couture,'' she said. ''Yet it works for a woman who loves to be Goth and edgy. It all has to do with the cut and the silhouette.'' The line is close to the body without being limiting, and Mr. Elbaz's use of ivory silk charmeuse, mixed in with navy and black and patent-leather accessories, throws a flattering light on the face. It's one of those collections in which the dress solutions seem incredibly simple.If you were following the shows online, you may have noticed a tendency toward exaggerated sleeves. Boxed, belled and barrel-shape sleeves turned up in a number of collections, notably Fendi, Yves Saint Laurent, Lanvin and Dior, for which John Galliano reprised shapes from his January couture show and brought them into his romantic Galliano label as well.By contrast, the sleeves of Rick Owens's jackets looked wand-thin. Yet he, too, went for the exaggerated gesture, with oversize funnel collars and wide fleece lapels. The same was true for Azzedine Ala&#239;a, who balanced his high-waist, bell-shape wool skirts with his immaculate sense of proportion. ''Hands-down, my favorite collection was Ala&#239;a,'' said Ikram Goldman, the owner of the Ikram boutique in Chicago.Another dominant look is the oversize coat. There are essentially two schools of thought: Stefano Pilati's draped, slightly masculine style for Saint Laurent and the Poiret, blouson-back cocoons from Prada and Proenza Schouler, which look different in part because the silhouette has been pulled toward the back.For all the black, navy and charcoal that appeared on the runways, the most memorable collections invariably had a jolt of color. In fact, there are so many ways to play with color that to single out one is to limit another.Linda Dresner, the owner of boutiques in New York and Michigan, bought sleek pantsuits from the London designer Todd Lynn, who showed them with orchid-bright shirts. Dior was awash in violets, fuchsias and greens. And there were the almost childish hues at Comme des Gar&#231;ons, which Ms. Goldman believes will help introduce the avant-garde label to a younger audience.But perhaps the best way (or, anyway, the newest way) to think about color is as accent. You may not give a marigold leather bag a second look, but when Mr. Jacobs put it over the shoulder of a long, lean blue jacket, he opened our eyes to the possibilities.Is color the new layering? Tights in shades of chartreuse, burnt orange and turquoise were key to the looks at Balenciaga, John Galliano and Undercover. Miuccia Prada offered two-tone knee socks. With shoes in a contrasting color, the idea is almost too eccentric to flub.Last season, to the surprise of mere mortals, designers saw women as superheroes. While some of those imaginings contributed to the technological history of fashion (few more so than Mr. Ghesquiere's sculptural tailoring), they also reminded us that we are all too human.And that's what will draw women toward the fall clothes, whether it's the cozy, swirling knits from Nina Ricci, the subtle innovations of Jun Takahashi at Undercover or the controlled volumes at Lanvin. It's fashion that is recognizably human.</text></article><article id="1833026"><summary>Rachel Zoe establishes multifaceted fashion career based on her talent as stylist and fame derived from working with celebrities; photos (M)</summary><text>RACHEL ZOE strums her moods like the strings of a guitar. Her tone, dulcet when she talks about the women she has dressed -- Hollywood nymphets like Keira Knightley and Mischa Barton -- turns raspy when she catalogs her woes. There is the jackhammer pounding from the construction site opposite her house in the Hollywood hills; there is the walk-in closet that cannot begin to contain her personal wardrobe, its contents spilling into three adjacent rooms. But Ms. Zoe, a celebrity stylist almost as famous as the stars she dresses, coaxes out a plangent chord on the subject that most vexes her: the rude gossip that trails her wherever she goes.''It's like being punished by your parents for something you didn't do,'' she said last week, in response to rumors that have variously portrayed her as a taskmistress who foists diet-drug cocktails on her clients to whittle them into sample sizes, and as suffering herself from an eating disorder that has ravaged her tiny frame. Most grievous, in her view, is the talk that she ceaselessly schemes to upstage her clients by thrusting herself at the camera with the likes of Ms. Barton, Ms. Knightley and Nicole Richie (who deserted Ms. Zoe last month for a rival stylist).Snatching the spotlight ''was never my intention,'' Ms. Zoe insisted over Diet Cokes and brownies on her palm-shaded patio. ''I never set out to be in the public eye.''In recent months Ms. Zoe has parlayed her fame (or notoriety), her talents and a readily identifiable Rachel Zoe look -- a studiedly disheveled distillation of vintage clothes and current designs -- into a multitentacled fashion career. The latest red-carpet stylist to affix her name to a product line, Ms. Zoe, who began as a stylist for YM magazine in the 1990s, stands to eclipse them all.In the last year, L'Wren Scott, who dresses Nicole Kidman and Ellen Barkin, introduced her own fashion label. Patricia Field, the costume designer for ''Sex and the City'' and ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' now markets her own line; and Andrea Lieberman, who dresses Faith Hill and Mary J. Blige, designs jewelry for Mouawad and consults on L.A.M.B., the sportswear collection conceived by her client Gwen Stefani.As for Ms. Zoe, she juggles projects. She is at work on a handbag collection, her second, for Leiber, formerly Judith Leiber.''She is one of those rare personalities in this business who can make a name for herself, and in this case almost brand herself,'' said Frank Zambrelli, the president of Leiber and Ms. Zoe's collaborator in the bags' design. Baroque in their styling, they sell for about $2,500 to $9,000.Charlie Corwin, a Hollywood producer who with Jamie Patricof is developing a television pilot with Ms. Zoe, calls her one of the world's most influential fashion personalities. ''More so than in the past,'' he said, ''the fashion industry today is largely driven by celebrities. Rachel is the conduit to that. And certain members of the old guard in fashion are probably feeling threatened by that.''Ms. Zoe, who reportedly commands up to $6,000 a day for talking her clients out of their dungarees and baseball caps (a figure she would not confirm), acknowledged that the gossip stings. ''Over the last year I've learned to develop a really thick skin,'' she said.But the whiff of scandal that clings to her is an integral part of the Zoe mystique. Cinco Calfee, the senior manager for strategic marketing at Samsung, which is featuring Ms. Zoe in a print campaign for its BlackJack cellphone, said that her controversial image has been a boon. ''It only raises her profile,'' Ms. Calfee said. Among potential Samsung customers, ''she's getting a lot of attention. People who didn't know who she was a year ago know her now.''Ms. Zoe, who styled spring 2007 advertising campaigns for Leiber and the Jimmy Choo shoe brand, has simultaneously been working on staff uniforms for the Thompson Hotel in Beverly Hills, in collaboration with Jenni Kayne, a Los Angeles designer.She consults for Piperlime.com, a Web site selling shoes that is run by the Gap, and performs a similar service for Revolveclothing.com, a popular shopping site that features Ms. Zoe's styling tips. She is writing a guide, ''Style A to Zoe,'' to be published by Warner Books in October.Although confidentiality agreements prohibit her from talking about her plans, she said she is about to complete arrangements to style or design for at least two well-known luxury brands. Her agent, Todd Shemarya, confirmed that Ms. Zoe will be a creative consultant for Halston, the legendary fashion house, which this week was bought by the film producer Harvey Weinstein and a private equity group. She will help put together a creative team for the house.PUBLICLY hiring a stylist to design or market a fashion label is a departure for the fashion industry. A half-dozen years ago, stylists were all but invisible -- service personnel hovering behind the scenes, shrouded in sweats and darting to center stage only to pin a stray seam.Today they are the boldface names. ''They're walking down the carpet, sitting in the front rows at fashion shows and invited to fabulous parties'' said Bonnie Fuller, the editorial director of American Media, which publishes Star magazine. ''They're living the celebrity lifestyle.''In Ms. Zoe's case, the pictures seem to tell the tale. Last fall she appeared in Harper's Bazaar celebrating her 35th birthday party at Social Hollywood, a club on Sunset Boulevard, partying with intimates like Debra Messing, Mary-Kate Olsen, Ms. Knightley, Ms. Barton and Ms. Richie.She is routinely seen in celebrity gossip magazines like Star, toting supersize handbags and wearing alien-style specs. She hobnobs with her clients -- her ''girls,'' as she calls them -- in much the same way that Halston socialized with Liza Minnelli in the 1970s and early '80s, outfitting her, then escorting her to Studio 54.Ms. Zoe stands to profit from similar associations. Socializing with the stars ''gives the stylist a certain cachet of being in the know,'' said Dana Telsey, an independent retail analyst. Stylists like her ''do have the ability to make a name for themselves,'' Ms. Telsey said, and to transform their personal wattage into a valuable marketing tool. She added that the phenomenon, while ''still in its infancy,'' bears watching nonetheless.To Ms. Zoe's detractors, especially her peers, the phenomenon rankles.''It's shocking to see a stylist get as much publicity as her clients,'' said Wayne Scot Lukas, who has dressed Janet Jackson and Meryl Streep. Mr. Lukas, who sells a sportswear collection on HSN shopping channel, said that for a stylist like Ms. Zoe to ''step away from her primary role as caretaker and actively seek out the flashbulbs is the kiss of death.'' He suggested that her angling for the spotlight would cost Ms. Zoe clients.Not so, she maintained. Aside from Ms. Richie, whom she declined to discuss, ''I haven't lost anyone,'' she said.Ms. Zoe both caters to and circulates among Hollywood's hard-partying set, young actresses who are the subject of continual rumors in the tabloids and on the Web. As their stylist, she has been caught in the cross hairs, portrayed as a controlling ''older sister,'' as dependent on drugs as some of her clients. Those rumors, Ms. Zoe said, ''not only have no merit, they are so opposite of reality.''Sounding by turns wounded and willful, she added: ''I've never touched a drug in my life. Until recently, I didn't even know what crystal meth was. And I haven't known the name of a diet drug since Dexatrim in the '80s. The only person I've told to lose weight is my mom.''Mr. Weinstein, who has known Ms. Zoe for years, called her ''the straightest, most conservative person I know. Socially she is boring. The most I've seen Rachel do at any party or event is have a glass of white wine.''Some suggest Ms. Zoe is vulnerable in part because she has forged relationships with clients that some of them find oppressive. Inexperienced in the ways of style, they appear to have refashioned themselves in her image -- Zoebots, as rival stylists call them -- dressed in look-alike Grecian draped gowns and Mod-inspired minis.Ms. Zoe concedes that she has a hard time keeping professional and personal relationships apart. ''I nurture these girls,'' she said of her clients and styling assistants. ''We're like family. I don't know how to do it any other way. We laugh, we fight, we let our guards down. If we bond, we have to hang out.''She has even enlisted her husband, Rodger Berman, an investment banker turned awards-show entrepreneur, as a collaborator. ''He goes to the shows in Europe with me,'' she said. ''And here at home, my girls have done whole fashion shows for him.''Her relationships come from the heart, she said, her style sense ''from the gut.'' Mr. Zambrelli of Leiber is impressed by her radar. ''She brings almost a prescient sense of where the market is going to be, and of where peoples' tastes are,'' he said.Ms. Zoe has a personal affinity for vintage pieces, which she mixes with pristine Gucci, Herm&#232;s and Chanel. Pulling a leopard-spot Saint Laurent coat from her closet, she gushed: ''My mother gave me this. It's fabulous, isn't it? I wore it the very first hour.''Her makeup, too, owes a debt to the old-school glamour of an Edie Sedgwick or Brigitte Bardot. ''I'm always going to have a smoky eye and a matte lip,'' she said. Then, in the next breath, she unabashedly contradicted herself. ''I'm going to head toward a polished lady look,'' she mused. ''I'm feeling Grace Kelly. I like to mix it up.''It's about change, isn't it?''</text></article><article id="1833027"><summary>Ties in atypical fabrics and novel cuts are on sale at men's shops from Bergdorf Goodman and Bblessing on Lower East Side; photo (M)</summary><text>LIKE many men working in a creative field, Michael Famighetti is not a traditional tie guy. ''I find most of them too wide, or too silk,'' he said. ''Basically, too stuffy.'' Which is not to say that Mr. Famighetti, 28, a photo editor at the Aperture Foundation, does not like wearing ties. He just prefers them loosened up a bit, a little offbeat, somewhere between a Ferragamo and a fish tie.It appears that a lot of stylish men are feeling similarly playful. Men's shops, from Bergdorf Goodman to Bblessing on the Lower East Side, are stocked with neckties made from atypical fabrics or cut in novel ways. They are refreshingly, charmingly odd.''It's that tension between the traditional and the unusual that I find appealing,'' said Alexander Olch, a tie designer, whose round tortoiseshell glasses and halo of red mad-scientist hair mirror the skewed preppiness of his Italian corduroy and gingham seersucker ties.At Dior Homme, the designer Hedi Slimane has trimmed his already skinny ties to a three-quarter-inch strip that clips around the collar and hangs below the waist. At A.P.C., scarflike cotton knits feel as light as a T-shirt and about as formal.And James Kendi, a Brooklyn tie designer whose dagger-shape bandanna and buffalo plaid ties are worn by Mr. Famighetti (not to mention Justin Timberlake), sees his neckwear as part of a way of life -- a goofy albeit style-conscious one best portrayed in a video on his Web site (kendities.com) of a lanky guy in a striped tie dancing on a bed to Serge Gainsbourg's ''Sea, Sex and Sun.''But what about Mr. More Ordinary? Can he wear a cheeky tie and not look clownish? The answer is yes. But Matthew Edelstein, the fashion editor of Details magazine, cautions: ''It's important to keep the rest of your styling subtle. Pairing an unusual tie with an equally statement-making look could make you appear as if you'd recently escaped from the mental ward.''FINE POINTS</text></article><article id="1833028"><summary>Ginia Bellafante reviews Mike Batistick play; Michael Imperioli, E J Carroll and Sharon Angela star; photo (M)</summary><text>The men and women who populate contemporary relationship dramas tend to belong to a specific demographic, and when they quarrel, do so on pale sofas and sea grass rugs. Their minds may be cluttered -- with unruly dissatisfaction, with upper-middle-class regret -- but their rooms have the air of 100 oxygen tanks.The set of ''Chicken,'' a new play by Mike Batistick at Michael Imperioli's Studio Dante, inflicts a certain stifling anxiety right away. Designed in exquisite detail by Mr. Imperioli's wife, Victoria Imperioli, the set is a tiny, cramped apartment full of the mess of people who must worry about money.Mr. Batistick renders his metaphors in the thickest available chalk, but the story itself is as moving as the jump over the class divide is rare. ''Chicken'' is about marriage and imperiled masculinity. In it a cuckold of a husband, Wendell (E. J. Carroll), who works for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and grew up in foster care, takes an avid interest in cockfighting in the hope that it will bring in much-needed extra income to help support his growing family.Mr. Imperioli plays the best friend he enlists to help him win the fight, and while his talents are undeniable, it is Mr. Carroll who dominates, who is such a believable presence onstage that it is hard to shift your attentions away from him. But Sharon Angela, who plays his wife, Lena, more than rises to the challenge of balancing her character's brittle demeanor and soft, ruined spirit.Ms. Angela's training on ''The Sopranos,'' in which she plays the widow Rosalie Aprile, has clearly given her a knack for deadpan humor, and here she elevates lines that might easily come off as clich&#233; with the dexterity of her comic rhythm. When asked why she is smoking while pregnant, she responds not with defensiveness but with mellow resignation: ''People in Ireland do it all the time.''In this play her cast mate from ''The Sopranos,'' Mr. Imperioli, again succeeds in bringing us the thug loser, and you cannot watch without wondering when he will do something radically different. (''Law &amp; Order'' doesn't count.) What a pleasure it would be to see him as a temperate financial planner, or maybe a chemist.''Chicken'' runs through March 31 at Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1833030"><summary>Room to Improve column comments on how high a sofa should be relative to other seating in the room; photo (M)</summary><text>Q. How high should my sofa be, relative to the other seating in the room?A. A rule of thumb is that seating should be between 15 and 18 inches off the ground. Any higher and a seat will feel too throne-like; any lower and you will feel like you are sitting on the floor.You might think that in a room with several seating arrangements, there would be some flexibility in seat heights. Not so, according to Jeffrey Bilhuber, the designer responsible for the interior at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel in New York, as well as the homes of Mariska Hargitay and David Bowie.Excessive variation in seat heights makes it hard for people to talk to each other, Mr. Bilhuber said, which is a problem, especially when you are entertaining.''Three inches is the maximum seat-height disparity you can have without ruining the party,'' he said.But don't try to get around the problem by buying matching seating, which will erase a room's character.''Please do not buy a matching furniture 'suite' with no personality from a big-box store in order to get corresponding seat heights,'' Mr. Bilhuber said.If you want to buy all your furniture from one company, he said, ''make sure you get pieces that are similar in seat height, but also present different textures and color tones.''In his own living room, Mr. Bilhuber has a 10-foot sofa, a 19th-century settee and a set of 10 antique chairs, all within a comfortable range of heights. His previous living room, above, had three very different seating pieces with similar heights.To create a mix of styles with similar seat heights, you can look for a company that carries many different brands and lists seat heights at its Web site. One such site is Design Within Reach (dwr.com). For a medium- to large-size living room, you could start with a basic Portola Sofa ($1,998 to $4,298, depending on length and fabric) and a matching armchair ($1,398 to $1,898) in a different color. In an adjacent seating area, you could add a loveseat like the mod-looking (and modular) Libre Two Seater ($1,198 to $1,298 in fabric; $1,998 in leather). For visual interest, you might throw in a chair or two like Philippe Starck's aluminum Heritage Rocker from Emeco ($640) or the Ultra Bellini Chair ($195), made of injection-molded nylon with a flexible back. The room will look stylishly mismatched, but all the seat heights will be the same: 18 inches.You can do a seat-height check just as easily at Ikea's Web site (ikea.com). You might like the way a traditional-looking beige Ektorp chair ($349) contrasts with a black leather Sandhem sofa ($999); both have a 17 3/4-inch seat height.Besides evaluating the seating, you should consider the other furniture in the room. David Ling, a New York-based architect who does residential and retail interiors, recommends choosing ''a big, substantial grounding piece to tie all the seating together,'' like a coffee table.For one client, Mr. Ling picked a Kjaerholm sofa and chair in black leather; between them, he placed a raw-edged wood table by George Nakashima. The Stick coffee table from Lorna Lee John Muller Designs (around $9,000), a collection of wooden sticks fused into a single blocky whole, would be another high-impact choice. It is so impressive, it almost compensates for having one uncomfortably high piece of furniture.Finally, if you love a chair or a sofa but the legs are too high, Mr. Bilhuber said, there is an extreme solution: hire a professional with a hacksaw and have the legs cut down. But check with an appraiser first, especially if the piece is an antique, to make sure you are not chopping off its value.</text></article><article id="1833031"><summary>Venerable textile and housewares companies, some centuries old, embrace new designs, but rely on their original hand production methods (S)</summary><text>MANY textiles and housewares companies now produce avant-garde products, but some have been doing so for years -- in fact, for centuries.One of the oldest is St.-Louis, the French glassworks, which has made fine crystal stemware since 1586 and is now making modern pieces. Wedgwood, the British china company, traces its history to 1759, when Josiah Wedgwood founded a pottery works and produced the first cream-colored earthenware. Nymphenburg porcelain has been run by the Bavarian royal family since 1761; today it makes very modern tableware by designers like Hella Jongerius, Ted Muehling and Khashayar Naimanan, a Londoner who started his career in graffiti.While these companies embrace new design, most reject new technology, relying on their original hand production methods. It is an approach that they insist ensures high quality; the downside is that their products remain costly.1. Excess is a line of crystal by Herv&#233; Van der Straeten, the Parisian designer, for St.-Louis. The Line Chandelier, 63 inches tall and 39 wide, has arms studded with cut crystals that look like rough rocks ($75,500). Store locations: (800) 441-4488, or hermes.com.2. Mr. Van der Straeten also created Excess crystal stemware for St.-Louis, in a variety of sizes and gemstone colors like ruby, amethyst and black diamond. The tall goblets, 8 1/2 to 10 1/2 inches, are $400 (for clear glass) to $595 (for colored). Store locations: (800) 441-4488.3. Each piece of Nymphenburg's Hidden Wealth dinnerware, designed by Khashayar Naimanan in a signed, limited-edition set, has a hand-painted pattern on the bottom and the manufacturer's mark on top. On an ordinary table, the pattern would be hidden. But the set is sold only with a glass-top steel table by Mr. Naimanan, with a mirror beneath the serving surface, so everyone can see the pattern. The dinnerware comes in sets of 6 or 12 place settings -- with the table -- starting at $52,000. Store locations: (312) 421-3500.4. Ted Muehling created White Coral, another dinnerware pattern for Nymphenburg. This set can be bought by the piece: a clamshell or a snail shell is $219; a salad plate with a broken rim is $459; an unpierced dinner plate is $459. Store locations: (312) 421-3500.5. Brunschwig &amp; Fils, a textiles company founded in France 118 years ago, is known for its traditional fabrics. But it also produces a Kirk Brummel line of contemporary textiles made of synthetic fibers -- some laser-cut, like Gramercy Square, shown hanging near a window ($147 a yard, to the trade). Showroom locations: (800) 538-1880 or brunschwig.com.6. Plato Gold is a reinterpretation of classic gold-rimmed white dinnerware; some pieces have coral or floral motifs. Part of the Eternity Collection of bone China dinnerware from Wedgwood, it is $185 for a five-piece place setting. Stores: (800) 955-1550 or wedgwoodusa.com.7. Baccarat, the French glassware company, was founded in 1764 and started making crystal in 1816. Today it manufactures glassware in patterns by contemporary designers like Philippe Starck, Andr&#233;e Putman and Arik Levy, who designed this stacked-cube candleholder. It comes in a stack of two ($235), three ($325) or five ($475).

She was 74.The cause was breast cancer, said her partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen.At a time when few gay men and women dared come out in private, much less in public, Ms. Gittings was a vocal -- and highly visible -- figure in the fledgling gay rights movement. In the late 1950s, she founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, the first national organization for lesbians. In the 1960s, she took part in early gay rights demonstrations at the White House and elsewhere. In the early 1970s, she helped lobby the American Psychiatric Association to change its stance on homosexuality; in 1973, the association rescinded its definition of homosexuality as a mental disorder.''She was one of the rare people in the homophile movement -- before Stonewall -- who took a militant stance,'' David Carter, the author of ''Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution'' (St. Martin's, 2004), said in a telephone interview. ''And she not only took a militant stance, but she was in the forefront.''Ms. Gittings also worked to make information about gay men and lesbians more widely available in libraries. Though not a librarian by training, she was for many years the head of the American Library Association's Gay Task Force. (It is known today as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Round Table.) In that capacity, she oversaw and edited the association's comprehensive bibliography of literature by and about gay men and lesbians.As Ms. Gittings often said in interviews, she became keenly aware of the need for such a bibliography as a young woman, when she scoured local libraries, seeking, but seldom finding, something that would help her understand her own life.Barbara Gittings was born on July 31, 1932, in Vienna, where her father was a member of the United States diplomatic corps. Returning to the United States when Barbara was young, the family eventually settled in Wilmington, Del. When she was a teenager, her father caught her reading ''The Well of Loneliness,'' the 1928 novel of lesbian love by the English writer Radclyffe Hall. He told her to burn the book. He did so by letter, for he could not bring himself to speak to her.Ms. Gittings entered Northwestern University, intending to study drama. But she was increasingly distracted by the need to learn as much as she could about homosexuality. She haunted the libraries of Chicago, unearthing little that was relevant and less that was encouraging.''I had to find bits and pieces under headings like 'sexual perversion' and 'sexual aberration' in books on abnormal psychology,'' Ms. Gittings told the publication American Libraries in 1999. ''I kept thinking, 'It's me they're writing about, but it doesn't feel like me at all.' ''She left Northwestern after her freshman year, and throughout her decades of activism supported herself with clerical jobs. In 1958, commuting from her home in Philadelphia, Ms. Gittings started the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, which was founded in San Francisco in 1955; she later edited the organization's national newsletter, The Ladder. In 1965, she took part in one of the first gay rights pickets of the White House, an effort to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians in federal employment.Ms. Gittings received many awards, among them honorary membership in the American Library Association. The Free Library of Philadelphia named its gay and lesbian collection for her. This week, the New York Public Library acquired the papers of Ms. Gittings and Ms. Lahusen, which chronicle more than half a century in the gay rights movement.Besides Ms. Lahusen, her companion of 46 years, Ms. Gittings is survived by a sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor of San Diego. With Ms. Lahusen, Ms. Gittings lived for many years in Philadelphia and Wilmington before moving to Kennett Square in January.''Before Barbara died, we went jointly into an assisted-living facility here,'' Ms. Lahusen said by telephone. ''Our last bit of activism was to come out in the newsletter of our assisted-living facility.''</text></article><article id="1833064"><summary>F Clark Howell, who is credited with transforming study of human origins, dies at age 81; photo (M)</summary><text>F. Clark Howell, credited with transforming the study of human origins from just ''stones and bones'' to a broader discipline drawing on biology, ecology, geology and primatology, died on Saturday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 81.The death was announced yesterday by the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a professor emeritus of anthropology. Dr. Howell learned last year that he had cancer, the announcement said.Rising to prominence 50 years ago, as the science of human origins made the first in a succession of discoveries in Africa, Dr. Howell worked with Louis and Mary Leakey and then their son, Richard. The Leakeys established East Africa as the likely nursery of human evolution.Dr. Howell led or participated in fossil-hunting excavations around the world, in Turkey, Spain and China, as well as Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania. It was as leader of an Omo Basin expedition in southern Ethiopia from 1968 to 1973, colleagues say, that he established the multidisciplinary approach to modern paleoanthropology, the science of early human origins.''When you look at a modern project, whether in Tanzania or South Africa or Ethiopia, you find Clark's stamp everywhere,'' said Tim D. White, a Berkeley professor of integrative biology and successful hunter of early human fossils. ''He personified modern paleoanthropology.''By that, Dr. White said he meant that Dr. Howell's research was not confined by geography or constricted by academic specialties.''He was as much a Paleolithic archaeologist interested in prehistory as a physical anthropologist interested in anatomy,'' Dr. White said. ''He integrated the physical, biological and behavioral sciences.''Dr. White was co-director with Dr. Howell of the Human Evolution Research Center, which Dr. Howell founded at the university in 1970. After retiring as a professor in 1991, Dr. Howell joined excavations in Spain and Turkey and returned to Ethiopia with Dr. White for fossil studies related to the recent discovery of a new hominid genus and species, Ardipithecus ramidus.Colleagues said this research in the Middle Awash Valley was notable on two counts. It appeared to extend the trail of human ancestors back nearly six million years, almost twice as early as the hominid species, Australopithecus afarensis, commonly known as Lucy.In addition, Dr. Howell trained many Africans on the discovery team. One of them, Giday WoldeGabriel of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said Dr. Howell ''was a genuine advocate for the advancement of Africans'' as full participants in fossil-hunting projects.As a founder and trustee of the Leakey Foundation, officials of the organization said, Dr. Howell had a wide influence on the field by steering research grants to young scientists engaged in new directions of scholarship. Likewise, he had earlier provided financial backing at a crucial stage in the work of Jane Goodall on chimpanzees and other projects on orangutans and gorillas and studies of modern human hunter-gatherers.Don Dana, vice president of the Leakey Foundation board, praised Dr. Howell as ''the one who took paleoanthropology from a fossil-recovery type of science to a science where we had to understand the geology, the flora and fauna, the chemistry, everything.''Francis Clark Howell was born on Nov. 27, 1925, in Kansas City, Mo. He served in the Navy in World War II and then entered the University of Chicago to study anthropology. He graduated in 1949 and received his doctorate in 1953.After two years as an anatomy instructor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he joined the faculty at Chicago as a physical anthropologist, becoming a full professor in 1962. He moved to Berkeley in 1970.Surviving are his wife, Betty Ann Howell of Berkeley; a son, Brian David Howell of Berkeley; a daughter, Jennifer Clare Howell, and a granddaughter, Alisa Howell-Smith, of McMinnville, Ore.; and two sisters, Margaret Johnson and Elizabeth Howell of Charlotte, N.C.In addition to his many scholarly publications, Dr. Howell wrote a popular book, ''Early Man,'' an entry in the Time-Life Nature Library series in 1965. The book sparked the interest of Tim White, then a teenager, in anthropology, eventually leading to his close scientific collaboration with the author.</text></article><article id="1833071"><summary /><text>The police fired on protesters in eastern India early Wednesday, killing at least 11 people at a demonstration against one of the new Chinese-style economic zones.The violence erupted when the police tried to enter Nandigram, a rural area in West Bengal State, where the Salim Group of Indonesia has proposed building a vast chemical hub. Protesters had blockaded the area for several weeks, and it was effectively off limits to state law enforcement.The Nandigram strife has become a parable of a larger debate roiling India over whether and how the government acquires agricultural land and hands it over for industrial development. The central government announced in January that it would temporarily suspend the approval of new zones and review rules for acquiring land and compensating landowners and farmers.The Special Economic Zones at issue are especially attractive to companies because they offer long-term tax breaks. Applications are pending in India for zones devoted to development as varied as technology companies and power plants.Roughly two-thirds of Indians rely on agriculture for their livelihood, and farmland conversion is an emotional and politically charged issue.West Bengal, which is governed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has emerged as the center of that debate.The state's government has faced protests in another area, Singur, over converting nearly 1,000 acres of agricultural land into an automobile factory. Last year, 11 people were killed in protests over the building of a steel plant in another eastern state, Orissa.</text></article><article id="1833073"><summary>Photos of New Yorkers enjoying warm March day as temperature reaches 69</summary><text /></article><article id="1833080"><summary>Arkansas General Assembly approves resolution that state's should be spelled with additional 's' in possessive case: Arkansas's (S)</summary><text>Bowing to a native son's passion for proper punctuation and etymological exactitude, the General Assembly has put the English-speaking world on notice: the possessive case of ''Arkansas'' requires an '' 's.''As in, Arkansas's many wonders.Please, not Arkansas'.''It's esoteric, I agree,'' said one of those wonders, Parker L. Westbrook, 81, a stickler for language and an authority on all things Arkansan, including its politics, ''but that doesn't mean it isn't important.''Indeed, a resolution passed Tuesday by the Senate requires that spelling in all official documents. The measure, written by Mr. Westbrook, was approved by the House last week. Gov. Mike Beebe is expected to sign it.Although not every manual of style agrees with the resolution, which does not specify criminal sanctions for failure to comply, the silent second ''s'' in Arkansas demands an apostrophe and a third ''s'' to form the possessive, Mr. Westbrook insisted, lest precision count for nothing. (For the record, the style manual at The New York Times agrees with Mr. Westbrook.)Had the State Legislature not decreed in 1881 that the name ''Arkansas'' would end with a silent 's,' there would be no cause for concern, he said.''This is not an apostrophe battle,'' he added. ''It's a war to recognize the definition of the word 'silent.' ''There was some silent rolling of eyes amid the ayes, but no legislator dared seriously challenge the research or the resolve of Mr. Westbrook. Since 1949, he has been an aide to a governor, two United States senators and two congressmen. They included Representative Boyd A. Tackett, whose grandson, State Representative Steven P. Harrelson, Democrat of Texarkana, sponsored the resolution.''As much as anything it's a tribute to Parker,'' Mr. Harrelson said with a chuckle, citing Mr. Westbrook's dedication to historic preservation.</text></article><article id="1833081"><summary>Florida jury recommends that John E Couey be sentenced to death for rape and murder of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in 2005 (S)</summary><text>The sex offender who was convicted last week of the rape and murder of Jessica Lunsford, 9, in 2005 should be executed, a jury recommended on Wednesday.The 12-member jury deliberated about an hour before voting, 10 to 2. to recommend the death penalty for the murderer, John E. Couey. It had found Mr. Couey guilty of first-degree murder, burglary, kidnapping and sexual battery.''This is justice for Jessie,'' Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, said outside the courthouse. ''Justice prevailed.''In the penalty phase of the trial, which began Tuesday, defense lawyers argued for a life sentence. They presented mental health experts who said Mr. Couey, 48, is retarded and has other mental problems.Experts called by the prosecution rejected those views.''Mental health issues had nothing to do with this crime,'' the prosecutor, Ric Ridgway, said in closing arguments. ''If this is not the person who deserves the death penalty, who does?''Mr. Couey's lawyer, Alan Fanter, asked jurors to let his client live, saying, ''Justice is not vengeance.''The jury recommendation will be heavily considered by Judge Richard A. Howard of Circuit Court in Citrus County. The judge will make the final determination in several weeks.Jessica's family reported her missing in February 2005 when they realized that she had disappeared from her bedroom in Homosassa, 55 miles north of Tampa. Her body was found three weeks later. The authorities said she had been buried alive outside Mr. Couey's mobile home.Mr. Couey confessed and directed investigators to the body. Judge Howard did not allow the confession in the trial because Mr. Couey had not been granted a lawyer when he confessed.The trial was moved 300 miles to Miami because of heavy publicity.Mr. Couey, convicted in 1991 for exposing and fondling himself in the presence of a 5-year-old girl, was registered as a sex offender, but skipped counseling sessions and moved without telling parole officers. In April 2005, the Florida Legislature passed the Jessica Lunsford Act, which requires prison sentences of at least 25 years for child molesting and permanent electronic monitoring for many sex offenders.</text></article><article id="1833085"><summary>Sinkhole develops on East 96th Street in Manhattan; cause has not been determined but reportedly may involve sewer under street; photo (M)</summary><text>When it comes to the birth of a sinkhole, a big bang there is not.Shofi Ieslam did not hear one, anyway. He was working the day shift as a doorman at 10 East 96th Street. The sinkhole at the street end of his building's canopy evolved from near-nothingness.''It was a warp,'' he said. ''Then it started to grow.''So he was ''Present at the Creation,'' but Dean Acheson, secretary of state in the Truman administration, had something else in mind when he wrote that book. Franz Joseph Haydn made an oratorio of ''The Creation,'' but that was about something larger than this sinkhole.''I'd say it's a cab and a half long,'' said Eugene Cottrell, the superintendent at 8 East 96th Street. But this is New York, the world capital of bumper-to-bumper squeezes. This is why he immediately added, ''Two cabs if you're a good parker.''The pavement was cracked, like a layer cake with a firm top layer that has been attacked by a hungry eater. Or maybe the deep-down layer that shifts and cracks in an earthquake and is then pictured in a geology textbook that one only dimly remembers when contemplating an hours-old sinkhole from the sidewalk.As if the sinkhole were not large enough, workers with jackhammers arrived and enlarged it. They cut a bigger, more precise rectangle around the area. Mark Norton, who was visiting from Charlotte, N.C., and staying with friends around the corner, described the process in a way that made it sound like what a dentist does, drilling away the decayed part of a tooth and a bit more.It was far, far shallower than the 330-foot-deep sinkhole that swallowed a dozen homes and killed two teenagers in Guatemala City last month. Nor was 96th Street fouled by odors or shaken by the tremors that accompanied that sinkhole.Anne Canty, a deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, the agency responsible for repairing the problem, said the cause of what she called the ''street collapse'' had not been determined, but it appeared to involve a sewer under 96th Street. Mr. Ieslam, the doorman, remembered seeing someone doing repairs a month ago in a manhole nearby.''Maybe something spread underneath and this warp started,'' he said, ''or the thing that would start the warp started.''</text></article><article id="1833086"><summary>Article on guidelines for using cellphone abroad; focuses on different types of handsets and ways to save money; drawing (L)</summary><text>As a T-Mobile subscriber, Ken Grunski, a businessman in San Diego, knew that his cellphone would work during a trip to Tanzania.

T-Mobile charged him $5 a minute to roam in Tanzania.If Mr. Grunski had used one of the SIM cards he sells, he would have paid $1.15 a minute to call the United States and his calls -- averaging 16 minutes a day -- would have cost him $184, rather than $800.While Americans have embraced the convenience of using cellphones, trying to dial from overseas often brings surprises. Even if the phone works, voice mail may not. Depending on the handset, coverage can be spotty. Make the wrong choices, and you may find a huge bill.The right tactics to avoid those headaches depend on which carrier you use, the length of your trip and your destination.GSM vs. CDMAA majority of the world's cellphone subscribers -- 82 percent -- use the GSM technology standard, according to the GSM Association. In the United States, the major carriers use two systems. Cingular (now AT&amp;T) and T-Mobile use GSM, while Sprint and Verizon use CDMA, an incompatible technology.CDMA technology is found in North America, as well as some Asian countries, but it is basically nonexistent in Europe, Australia and South Africa. As a result, Sprint and Verizon customers can use their phones in just 26 countries. (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers can potentially use theirs in over a hundred.)When traveling in non-CDMA countries, Sprint and Verizon customers can rent or purchase GSM phones from those providers. Sprint rents a Motorola Razr for $58 for the first week, and $70 for two weeks, plus $1.29 to $4.99 a minute of airtime. Verizon charges $3.99 a day to rent, plus $1.49 to $4.99 a minute. Verizon also sells three combo CDMA-GSM models, priced from $150 to $600 with a two-year contract.Cingular and T-Mobile customers have more options -- if their existing phones can pick up multiple frequencies. To complicate matters, the American GSM standard operates on 850 and 1,900 megahertz, while the rest of the GSM world uses 900 and 1,800 megahertz.To use an American GSM cellphone in a foreign country, the handset you own must be tri-band or quad-band and able to operate on one or both of the frequencies used outside the United States. The Cingular and T-Mobile Web sites, as well as Telestial's and others, list the predominant frequencies used in each country, and show if your phone can operate on one or both overseas bands.To protect against fraud, American cellphones are typically blocked from making calls when used abroad. Before traveling, call your provider and ask to have that restriction removed.A Temporary SIM CardGSM phones use SIM cards (subscriber identity modules), tiny electronic chips that hold a cellphone's ''brains,'' including the subscriber's contact numbers and phone number. (CDMA phones store such information directly in the hardware.)GSM customers can avoid sky-high roaming charges by replacing their American SIM cards with ones from other countries. For example, travelers to Britain can pick up a SIM card from the British carrier Vodafone; once inserted, it gives the phone a temporary British phone number. Calls within Britain and to the United States would be much cheaper.For example, T-Mobile charges its customers $1.99 a minute for using their phones in Britain, whether calling a pub in London or your home in New Jersey.Insert a prepaid British SIM card instead, and local calls drop to 26 cents a minute, while calls back to the United States cost 9 to 14 cents a minute.Another benefit when using overseas SIM cards is that incoming calls are typically free in most countries.Overseas SIM cards can be purchased before you travel from companies like Cellular Abroad (www.cellularabroad.com) and Telestial (www.telestial.com) or at local shops in foreign countries.Unlocking the PhoneEven if you have a GSM phone that operates on both overseas frequencies, domestic cellphone providers do not want you to use your phone with another company's SIM card, because they do not make any money when you do. To prevent your doing so, cellphones bought through Cingular and T-Mobile are electronically locked -- they accept only their own company's SIM cards.Before you throw your phone off the Eiffel Tower in frustration, know that there are several ways to unlock your phone and avoid those high overseas roaming rates.Cingular and T-Mobile will unlock their customers' phones under certain conditions. Cingular will provide unlock codes to customers whose contracts have expired, who have canceled their service and paid an early termination fee, or who have paid a full rather than subsidized price for their phones, according to Rich Blasi, a Cingular Wireless spokesman.T-Mobile has more lenient policies. It will provide the unlock code to any customer after 90 days of service, but no more than one unlock code will be provided every 90 days, said Graham Crow, a T-Mobile spokesman.If you do not meet these requirements, you can still get your phone unlocked from a private company. For a few dollars, the Travel Insider (www.thetravelinsider.com) and UnlockTelecom (www.unlocktelecom.co.uk) will provide your phone's specific unlocking code.Other GSM PhonesCellphone customers with dual-band GSM phones that cannot be used overseas can always purchase unlocked quad-band phones from third-party providers. These phones can be used solely when traveling outside the United States. Since they are unlocked, they can also be used instead of your current phone on your American network.Because the phone is not subsidized by a carrier, the price is higher. For example, an unlocked quad-band Motorola Razr V3 can be bought for $140 from Cellular Blowout (www.cellular-blowout.com). Cellular Abroad and Telestial also sell unlocked phones.A Few More TipsWhen entering numbers in your phone, always add the plus (+) sign and the country code; that way, the number can be dialed automatically no matter from what country you are calling.Store your GSM phone's numbers in the phone itself, rather than the SIM card. Then the numbers will still be available to you when you use an overseas SIM card. To transfer them to a new phone easily, store them on a device like Backup-Pal (www.backup-pal.com), an external U.S.B. memory unit.While you will not pay any charges for incoming calls when you use a foreign SIM card, tell your American callers to get an overseas calling plan from their phone company before you ask them to ring you. If they do not, they could be paying the same sky-high rates that you just avoided.And if you take your American phone overseas, make sure that its battery charger is dual voltage; without one, all the effort to get your phone to work in other countries may go up in smoke the first time you plug it in.CIRCUITSCorrection:  March 17, 2007, Saturday  An article in the Circuits pages of Business Day on Thursday about using cellphones overseas misstated the charge to T-Mobile USA customers for placing a call in Britain. It is 99 cents a minute, not $1.99. The article also referred incorrectly to the status of CDMA cellphone technology in Australia. While CDMA phones from American carriers do not operate there, other CDMA phones are in use; they are not ''basically nonexistent.'' And the article also referred incompletely to a source of low rates for calls from Britain. The rates -- 26 cents a minute for local calls and 9 to 14 cents a minute for calls to the United States -- are available with use of a SIM card sold by Telestial.</text></article><article id="1833097"><summary>Michelle Chadwick and Alexander Stein letters praise March 13 article on perinatal hospice</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''A Place to Turn When a Newborn Is Fated to Die'' (front page, March 13):What a beautiful portrait of these courageous parents, who are willing to endure the pain of embracing their precious and damaged children, for however brief a time.We have come so far in palliative care for those at the end of life; why not offer it as well to the children whose lives end at the beginning?Michelle Chadwick  Dallas, March 14, 2007To the Editor:''A Place to Turn When a Newborn Is Fated to Die'' poignantly underscores the importance of acknowledging, voicing and integrating the utterly personal experience of loss in a self-directed way.The news is overflowing with stories from near and far of unfathomable loss.

I don't know that that is going to be feasible, but I would certainly entertain it. And I think we have a remaining vital national security interest in trying to prevent Iran from crossing the border and having too much influence inside Iraq.And so it will be up to me to try to figure out how to protect those national security interests and continue to take our troops out of this urban warfare, which I think is a loser, and I do not believe that it can be successful. If we had done it right from the beginning, we might have had a fighting chance. We did not, and I think it is beyond our control now.But what we can do is to almost take a line sort of north of -- between Baghdad and Kirkuk, and basically put our troops into that region, the ones that are going to remain for our antiterrorism mission, for our northern support mission, for our ability to respond to the Iranians, and to continue to provide support, if called for, for the Iraqis.One of the things that I would hope to be able to do is to be able to get the unvarnished, honest opinions of a lot of the people who would have to make these decisions and fulfill these missions.I've had enough private conversations with enough generals and colonels and captains, that there is a lot of dissension about what we're doing and how we're doing it and how successful we can be doing it.And I think we've got to try to strip out the ideology and the particular passions of our current leadership and try to take a very unvarnished look at where we are and what it would take to try to achieve any of these missions over a reasonable period of time.If there is not any political resolution, the civil war will continue, and we need to get out of the way.So, yes, there will still be Al Qaeda and other extremist elements operating in Baghdad, but we're not going to be putting pressure on the Iraqi government to limit their response, or to prevent self-defense on the part of people in the neighborhoods who are being subjected to this reign of violence.It is going to happen if we stay there a year, if we stay there five years, unless there is some resolution, and I do not yet see that.Look, I think the American people are done with Iraq. I think they are at a point where, whether they thought it was a good idea or not, they have seen misjudgment, and blunder after blunder, and their attitude is, What is this getting us? What is this doing for us?No one wants to sit by and see mass killing. It's going on every day! Thousands of people are dying every month in Iraq. Our presence there is not stopping it. And there is no potential opportunity that I can imagine where it could. This is an Iraqi problem; we cannot save the Iraqis from themselves. If we had a different attitude going in there, if we had stopped the looting immediately, if we had asserted our authority -- you can go down the lines, if, if, if --But we didn't do it.</text></article><article id="1833110"><summary>Correction of March 9 obituary about Nils Y Wessell, former president of Tufts University</summary><text>''We would not be doing patrols.

She is from Brooklyn and majored in mathematics and musical theater at New York University.This year's Miss New York competition will be held July 12-to-14 at the Dix Hills Center for the Performing Arts in Huntington.The winner of each year's pageant goes on to compete in the Miss America contest. And the shift in New York locations is one of many changes in the larger competition, once one of the most watched network television events in the nation but now consigned to the narrower reach of cable television.The contest moved from its longtime home in Atlantic City to Nashville and other cities. In January, the contest drew 2.4 million viewers on the CMT network, down from a recent peak of 25 million viewers in 1995 on ABC.Huntington with a population of nearly 200,000 is more than seven times larger than Watertown.''So many of the past Miss New Yorks have been from the New York City metropolitan area that we felt that it was time to showcase our community and play host to the pageant and really utilize all the resources we have on Long Island,'' Dr. Paul C. Brown, a pageant co-executive director, said in a statement. By contrast, Miss Americas in the recent past have come from the Midwest and the South, usually from small towns.The last Miss New York to be crowned Miss America came from a Watertown competition, but her reign came to a hasty end.Vanessa Williams of Millwood -- in Westchester County, 36 miles north of New York City -- served only 10 months after she was crowned in September 1983. She resigned after nude photographs of her that had been taken two years earlier surfaced. She has since become a successful actress.</text></article><article id="1833233"><summary>Breaking Ground column describes AtlanticA, oceanfront resort and residential development in Dominican Republic; photo (S)</summary><text>WHAT -- Oceanfront resort and residential development.

Spread over peninsulas and islands in a bay and along the Atlantic coast, the initial phase of development will consist of 230 houses near a golf course designed by Arnold Palmer; a beachfront hotel with 112 condo-hotel units and 80 other rooms; 70 townhouses near a marina; and 33 houses overlooking the ocean from a bluff. Some of the condo-hotel units, which owners may enter in a rental program, will have private pools. The houses, many with private docks, can be customized with options like pools, wine cellars and screening rooms. Adjoining the marina will be a village with shops and restaurants, and plans call for a polo facility, a beach club and additional hotels and residences to be added later.NICK KAYEBreaking Ground is a weekly look at projects, planned or under construction, that include weekend or vacation homes.AtlanticABreaking Ground</text></article><article id="1833235"><summary>Weekend With the Kids column on visit to Portland, Ore; photos; map (M)</summary><text>PORTLAND is one of those friendly, funky cities you move to after college to be within easy striking distance of water, mountains, coffeehouses, brew pubs and like-minded people your age -- but it's just as friendly (if slightly less funky) when you have kids of your own in tow.Renowned for its embrace of public transportation (and tight limits on sprawl), Portland is a great walking city with a patchwork of neighborhoods that change hue and texture every few blocks. When little feet get sore, you can easily hop onto one of the buses, streetcars or light-rail trains that ply downtown avenues free of charge (within the designated Fareless Square). On weekend mornings, you'll find as many parents pushing strollers as joggers clutching iPods on the Eastside and Westside Riverwalk paths beside the Willamette River.WASHINGTON PARK ATTRACTIONSImagine Central Park as a steeply sloping conifer forest sprinkled with child-friendly attractions and you'll have some idea of Washington Park. A 10-minute ride from downtown by MAX Light Rail (Washington Park stop) or the No. 63 bus (or a five-minute drive in your own car), the park offers three top-rated children's destinations -- the Oregon Zoo, the Portland Children's Museum and the World Forestry Center -- all conveniently clustered together.The zoo is pretty self-explanatory (admission $9.75; $6.75 ages 3 through 11; 503-226-1561; www.oregonzoo.org) with an elephant herd, penguins, tree kangaroos and mountain goats in a Cascade Mountain setting. So is the Portland Children's Museum (503-223-6500; www.portlandcm.org; open Monday through Saturday 9 to 5; Sunday 11 to 5 p.m.; admission $7), with a hands-on construction exhibition, a hand-cranked water ''conveyor belt,'' a pint-size grocery store and craft studios. But don't rule out the World Forestry Center (503-228-1367; www.worldforestrycenter.org; admission $7, $5 ages 3 to 18) just because of the name. A $7 million renovation in 2005 introduced attractions like a waterless raft ride and a forest canopy ride ($4 extra) in which children (over 42 inches tall) are snapped into a harness and hoisted 60 feet into the treetops.For hiker tykes, there are miles of trails right outside the World Forestry Center entrance. Budding horticulturists may enjoy a romp through the International Rose Test Garden, also in Washington Park. The garden has fountains, sculptures, formal beds, paths, stairs and a terraced setting that some children will find magical.ARTS AND SCIENCESYou may need to resort to bribery to carve out time for the Portland Art Museum (1219 Southwest Park Avenue; 503-226-2811; www.portlandartmuseum.org; $10, $6 for ages 5 to 18), but that's what gift shops are for. First stop should be the Impressionist and Abstract Expressionist masterpieces in the museum's new Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art. When the attention spans of the young ones flag, let them blow off steam in the small but nicely arranged sculpture mall in the plaza between the two museum buildings, featuring Roy Lichtenstein's ''Brushstrokes'' and Anthony Caro's ''Gulf Stream.''If you have a junior scientist in tow, budget at least a couple of hours for the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (1945 Southeast Water Avenue, 503-797-6674; www.omsi.edu; $9; $7 ages 3 to 13). Children love the robots and the earthquake simulation; the laser shows with rock music scores are a blast for everyone. There are extra charges for these attractions, as there are for the Omnimax films, the planetarium and tours of the Blueback submarine, all rainy-day favorites.If hunger strikes in the midst of all that high-tech wizardry, hop into the car and drive five minutes to Mio Sushi at 3962 East Hawthorne Boulevard (503-230-6981) for a quick fix of ramen (from $3.50), udon with chicken ($4.95) or California roll ($3). Atmosphere is minimal, but the service is prompt, always a plus with little ones.DOWNTIME DOWNTOWNThe trendy Pearl District is ideal for relaxed urban wandering. Take the 10th Avenue streetcar north to Marshall Street and check out the new Tanner Springs Park, a sort of cross between an Italian piazza and a weedy urban wetland with lots of benches perched beside gently running streams.In the Pearl, you're never far from gelato and espresso -- in fact, Via Delizia is right across from the park at 1105 Northwest Marshall Street (503-225-9300). It's $2.50 for a single scoop of gelato, perhaps pistachio, peanut butter or pumpkin spice; $2.95 for a double-shot medium latte. Head over to 11th Avenue, then turn back south past Green Frog Toys at 1031 (a good place for Playmobil) and make another pit stop at Jamison Square at 810 Northwest 11th Avenue. You can perch on the stone steps and watch residents walk their dogs past the totem poles, play bocce and sip lattes from the adjoining Sip &amp; Kranz coffee lounge (purveyors of the highly regarded local Stumptown coffee).Continue south past the Hanna Andersson store (327 Northwest 10th Avenue), with timeless Swedish clothing for kids and parents, and end up at the main branch of Powell's Books (1005 West Burnside Street, 503-228-4651), a Portland landmark for new and used books -- so vast you need a map to navigate. The children's section, like everything here, is phenomenally well stocked.Not long ago, Portland replaced a freeway with the Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park -- and when the sun shines, residents turn out to jog, stroll and loiter beside the Willamette River at the southwest edge of downtown. Just south of the park, RiverPlace is a spiffy collection of shops, restaurants, cafes and ice cream places, with nice landscaping and views of the river to the east and of new high-density housing to the west. On a really nice day, get outfitted with wheels and maps at Waterfront Bicycle Rental (360 RiverPlace, 503-227-1719; www.waterfrontbikes.net; $28 for five hours).WHERE TO EATDan and Louie's Oyster Bar Restaurant (208 Southwest Ankeny Street, 503-227-5906) has been dishing up clam chowder ($5.50), fish and chips ($6.50 for a half-order of cod; $8.50 for halibut) and oyster stew ($7.50) since 1907, acquiring a burnished patina and a mesmerizing collection of sea shells and fancy china displayed on the walls. Save room for the chocolate sundae ($2.95).Mother's Bistro and Bar (212 Southwest Stark Street, 503-464-1122) is not really a bistro or serious bar at all (except maybe late at night), but a large welcoming downtown emporium of comfort food, three meals a day. Homesick New Yorkers can get H&amp;H bagels and lox ($12.95) or challah French toast ($7.95) or branch out to Belgian waffles ($5.95). Kids will find old favorites like burgers ($9.95), mac and cheese ($8.95), and chicken noodle soup ($3.95 a cup).Typhoon! is one of Portland's better Thai restaurants with three downtown locations (410 Southwest Broadway, 503-224-8285; 2310 Northwest Everett Street, 503-243-7557; and 720 Southwest Washington Street, 503-222-7991). Ideal for small appetites are ''nibble platters'' like chicken satay (three strips for $6.75) and Thai wrap ($8.95), which you assemble yourself out of coconut, lime and dried shrimp. The creamy royal duck curry ($15.95) is exquisite.WHERE TO SLEEPThe Hotel Monaco (506 Southwest Washington Street, 888-207-2201) is not only family friendly but dog friendly, with a chalkboard in the lobby listing resident dogs and a stash of dog treats at the desk. The high-ceilinged suites have cozy living rooms (with sofa beds) separated from king or queen bedrooms by sliding doors, and each room has its own television. Nice touches include teddy bears, funky-pattern robes, an evening wine reception and free wireless Internet access. Suites from $169.Embassy Suites Downtown (319 Southwest Pine Street, 503-279-9000) also offers suites, with sofa beds in the living rooms and separate bedrooms with kings or two double beds (starting at $139). Pluses here include a nice pool (for kids), a day spa (for adults), a grand historic building and a full breakfast.Hilton Portland and Executive Tower (921 Southwest Sixth Avenue, 503-226-1611) consists of two cater-corner towers, each with its own pool. Rooms are notably smaller than the accommodations at the other two hotels, but are a good deal for the location, near the Portland Art Museum and big downtown department stores. Rooms with two double beds start at $129.WEEKEND WITH THE KIDS</text></article><article id="1833238"><summary>Article on ski-golf events scheduled around country; photo (M)</summary><text>THE notion of skiing in the morning and golfing the same afternoon usually reflects wishful thinking -- or the convenience of a private jet. For a brief window in mid to late spring, however, weather conditions can converge in mountain spots to allow this elusive combination, and some resorts take advantage of it by holding annual ski-and-golf tournaments. The entrants vary in skill level and competitive drive, but all are in search of the ultimate day of recreation.''We get interest from people all over the country,'' said Doug Fish, whose marketing firm has organized Race and Ace ski-and-golf events in the Pacific Northwest since 2003. ''They take pride in the fact they can do both in one day. It's something they like to tell their friends about.''Race and Ace combines a dual giant slalom ski race (two runs) with an 18-hole scramble golf tournament. Race times and golf scores are ranked and then added together, with the lowest score winning.There will be two Race and Ace tournaments this spring: on May 5 in Oregon, at Mount Bachelor and the Meadows course of the Sunriver Resort; and two weeks later at the Tamarack Resort in Idaho, which has both a ski area and a Robert Trent Jones Jr. golf course.At the Mission Ridge ski area in Wenatchee, Wash., about three hours east of Seattle, the Steve Burchett Memorial Ski and Golf Classic on March 31 starts with a slalom race and continues with golf at the Highlander Golf Club in East Wenatchee. March usually favors both skiing and golfing, said Taylor Everett, the assistant ski patrol director at Mission Ridge, though last year, the vagaries of spring weather scuttled part of the tournament. Eight inches of new snow blanketed the mountain, but the golf course, 3,600 feet lower than the race course, was too rain-soaked to play, the first time part of the event was not held in its 12 years.Spirits weren't dampened, though. The event simply became an all-day ski fest. Not surprising, since these tournaments generally resemble spring break, not hard-nosed competition.At the Burchett Classic, competitors wear costumes, and the winning team dons pink blazers in a sly nod to the green jackets awarded to the champions of the Masters golf tournament. Participants at the yearly ski-golf tournament at Big Mountain in Whitefish, Mont., come out in Hawaiian shirts or retro ski wear.STILL, Mr. Fish of Race and Ace said, some competitors are serious. ''They'll show up to race in speed suits,'' he said, ''and we get some scratch golfers.''Bryan Paligo, 33, of Bend, Ore., has won the elite individual division in three of the five Race and Ace events he's entered. A former ski coach and a dedicated golfer (with a two handicap), he admits he takes the event ''a little more seriously than most people.''And with a good possibility of firm spring snow on a May morning at Mount Bachelor, which Mr. Paligo calls ''ideal race conditions,'' coupled with a sun-drenched afternoon on the greens, who can blame him?On the other hand, Ian Griffiths, 32, a self-described hacker on the golf course who has played in several of the Whitefish tournaments, said: ''There's a lot of trash talk going on in the beginning. But some of the better golfers are not very good skiers, so everyone really has a chance.''Ski-golf events are rare in the East. A late-April event the last three years at Bretton Woods, N.H., with Bode Miller as host, is being transformed into a skiing-only event a couple of weeks earlier to take advantage of better snow.At the Attitash ski area in New Hampshire, there's another variation: a nine-hole golf course temporarily built on a black-diamond ski trail for an annual on-snow golf tournament next week. Todd Anthony, the resort's grooming manager, said he and his staff use snow-grooming machines to sculpture features like elevated tees and greens, roughs made from churned-up snow and holes marked by institutional-size food cans. Players must compete on skis or snowboards.This course lacks one amenity, however, that's important to ski-golf competitors like Mr. Griffiths. Describing the approach of his ski-golf team at Whitefish in Montana, he said, ''After we'd triple-bogey our third hole, it was time to settle down and get that beverage cart over to us.''DETAILSBARTLETT, N.H. -- Attitash; (603) 374-2368; www.attitash.com.What: On-Snow Golf Tournament; $25 per team of four, plus lift tickets.When: March 24.WENATCHEE, WASH. -- Mission Ridge; (509) 663-6543; www.missionridge.com.What: Steve Burchett Ski and Golf Classic, $280 a foursome.When: March 31.WHITEFISH, MONT. -- Big Mountain; 406-862-2911; www.bigmtn.com.What: Hellroaring Saloon Ski-Golf Classic, $60 a person.When: April 1.MOUNT BACHELOR, ORE. -- Mount Bachelor and Sunriver; (503) 635-0007; www.raceandace.com.What: Race and Ace, $229 a person.When: May 5.TAMARACK, IDAHO -- (503) 635-0007; www.raceandace.com.What: Race and Ace, $179 a person.When: May 19.Ahead | Ski-Golf Events</text></article><article id="1833239"><summary>Correction of March 9 article about marketing of Israeli vacation homes to Americans (S)</summary><text>An article last Friday about the marketing of Israeli vacation homes to Americans misspelled the names of two Jerusalem neighborhoods, and a picture caption misstated the location of another.

Baumann and his wife, Karen, set off on their quest to buy a vacation home two years ago, they started in Myrtle Beach, S.C., then drove south toward Savannah, Ga., sizing up beach communities along the way. When they came upon Isle of Palms, a barrier island 15 miles east of Charleston, S.C., they stopped looking.In Isle of Palms, with its seven miles of beachfront, mild winters, swaying palmettos and upscale but easygoing lifestyle, the Baumanns knew they had found their home away from home.Most compelling to them was the beauty of the white beaches on Isle of Palms and its sister, Sullivan's Island, which is 100 yards across a small inlet next to the Intracoastal Waterway. Deeming Myrtle Beach to the north too crowded, and Kiawah, a barrier island to the south, too expensive, Mr. and Mrs. Baumann, who live in Wilmington, Del., bought a three-bedroom, three-story, three-bath, single-family home for less than $1 million in the gated community of Wild Dunes on Isle of Palms.Their house is typical of the two islands, built in what Mr. Baumann, who is a tax lawyer, calls ''the typical Charleston style, where the houses go up and not out.'' That kind of construction is dictated by the region's vulnerability to storm surges.Many newer homes are built with the living room, kitchen and master bedroom on the top floor to capture the best views, and the other rooms on the second floor. The ground level, most susceptible to flooding, is set aside for a garage or storage.Isle of Palms offers part-time residents a range of housing options, with time shares in condominiums and large vacation homes, along with conventional single-family homes. Residences on Sullivan's Island are almost all single-family homes.There is also a brisk rental market from March through September, mostly on Isle of Palms, though some weekly and monthly rentals can be found on Sullivan's Island.The SceneThough the two islands are separated by just a narrow inlet, each has a distinct character.Isle of Palms is crowded in its central part along the waterfront with large condo complexes and multimillion-dollar private homes. It pulses with beachgoers, shoppers and diners who often party into the night. One popular gathering spot is the Windjammer bar, which offers light fare and live music. The Windjammer has a capacity of about 600, and even more in warm weather when the crowd spills onto the deck.In the 1,600-acre gated Wild Dunes section of Isle of Palms, the pace is languid, though the community has some 2,500 homes. Life in Wild Dunes, as Mr. Baumann put it, is ''not too crowded, not too exclusive and just the right amount of laid back.''Besides the beach, the main attractions in Wild Dunes are golf -- two 18-hole courses designed by the architect Tom Fazio -- and tennis. There are 17 courts, five lighted for play at night.William and Mary Kay Friend, who live in McLean, Va., also found that Isle of Palms suited them. They bought a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house two years ago for $2.5 million amid a stretch of single-family homes along the ocean. ''We looked in the Caribbean Islands and in Florida for a second home,'' said Mr. Friend, a retired chemical engineer and a former corporate executive. ''But the first option was too far away from our grown children, and Florida was too homogeneous for our tastes.''They usually visit Isle of Palms for two weeks at a time, about six times a year. The Friends walk at least five miles each morning on the two islands, take care of business matters at home, then visit Charleston or nearby Mount Pleasant.Compared with the hustle and bustle of Isle of Palms, Sullivan's Island is the less assuming little sister with mainly single-family homes on half-acre lots. There, next to Fort Moultrie, where Edgar Allan Poe was stationed with the United States Army in the late 1820s, residents ride their bicycles and walk their golden retrievers.When Poe lived on Sullivan's Island, the setting for his story ''The Gold Bug,'' the place had just a few beach cottages, which he described as ''some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever.''Many newer residents on Sullivan's Island are converting vintage beach cabins that date back to the early 1900s into multimillion-dollar homes, said Stephen Herlong, who owns an architecture firm on Isle of Palms. His clients, many from the Northeast, commission him to build houses that are ''not ostentatious, but still have state-of-the-art kitchens and all the modern-day comforts.''ProsThe seemingly never-ending shorelines are the great lure of these two barrier islands. They are at once remote -- away from the noise and congestion of the city -- and still close enough to Charleston for its restaurants and culture.ConsNeither island offers much in the way of second-home options for less than $400,000, unless it's a one-13th share in a residence on the Isle of Palms. And, in late summer and early fall, there is always the threat of a hurricane.The Real Estate MarketThe two most significant changes on both islands in the last 15 years have been the sharp increase in the cost of housing and the number of people who live there part time, said Bill Ripley, a broker with the Keller Williams Island Realty on Isle of Palms.In 1993, a five-mile bridge was built over marshland to connect Isle of Palms to the mainland. At about the same time, major highways leading into Charleston were improved. What had been a much longer trip from places like Charlotte, N.C., and Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C., dropped to less than three hours, Mr. Ripley said. ''The sheer numbers of people increased,'' he said, ''and Isle of Palms became a busy weekend getaway place.''Many second-home owners start by renting, said Allison Dudley, a sales and rental agent for Island Realty on Isle of Palms. During high season, a two- to three-bedroom condo will rent for an average of $2,500 a week, she said. Large homes on the ocean with 10 or more bedrooms can rent for $19,000 a week.A record price for an oceanfront home on the Isle of Palms was set last fall when a 6,800-square-foot single-family house with nine bedrooms and nine baths sold for $5.75 million to a second-home buyer, said Vicki Hollingsworth of Beachside Real Estate in Isle of Palms. In 2005, houses of that size on the waterfront sold for $3 million to $5 million. Smaller houses, like three-bedroom ranches, are selling for $650,000, she said, but are usually razed to make way for larger houses.The median price for all homes listed for sale on both islands was $995,000 in 2006, but it was $1.25 million this week, according to the Charleston Trident Multiple Listing Service.Suzanne and Richard Galloway, who now live in Wild Dunes, rented at first. ''We started off in Atlanta,'' said Mr. Galloway, a business consultant, as he relaxed near the water on a recent mild winter day. ''Then we began renting a condo and vacationing here. The next thing that happened is that we fell in love with this place and bought a house. Now we've decided to retire here.''LAY OF THE LANDPOPULATION -- Sullivan's Island 1,911 and Isle of Palms 4,585, according to Charleston County.SIZE -- Sullivan's Island is 2.4 square miles, Isle of Palms 4.5 square miles.LOCATION -- The two barrier islands are 15 miles east of Charleston.WHO'S BUYING -- Property owners on the two islands run from couples with young children to empty nesters planning to retire there.

As you watch ''Premonition,'' a psychological thriller that scrambles time in the life of a desperate housewife, you imagine that the director, Mennan Yapo, and the screenwriter, Bill Kelly, must have some notion of where they're heading, so you suspend your doubts, invest your emotions and go along for the ride. After all, aren't these Hollywood professionals who know something about storytelling? And didn't a major star (Sandra Bullock) sign on to the project?The movie seems to be headed in several possible directions. Is it a supernatural ''Gaslight''? A Hitchockian psychological mystery like ''Marnie'' or ''Vertigo''? An M. Night Shyamalan party trick with a jack-in-the-box ending? None of the above, it turns out.The sloppy, absent-minded ''Premonition'' is a giant step backward for Ms. Bullock, who plays Linda Hanson, a woman with a perfect home, a perfect husband and two young daughters. Linda's world suddenly crashes around her when the local sheriff knocks on the door and tells her that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon), has died on a business trip when his car was hit by a truck.Grief settles over the Hanson household. Linda gently breaks the news to her daughters, Bridgette (Courtney Taylor Burness) and Megan (Shyann McClure). And her mother, Joanne (Kate Nelligan), and best friend, Annie (Nia Long), rush to her side to flutter around offering solace.But when Linda wakes up the next morning, she goes downstairs to find Jim contentedly sipping coffee and watching television. His death must have been a dream, she concludes. Soon after that she wakes to find the living room filled with anxious mourners. There is a spilled bottle of lithium in her bathroom sink. But the following morning she finds Jim in the shower. Is she losing her mind? After some tentative sleuthing, she decides that through a temporal mix-up, she has learned of Jim's imminent death before it takes place.The story brings in an ominous psychiatrist, Dr. Norman Roth (Peter Stormare), whom Linda has consulted but can't remember; enigmatic answering-machine messages; and Jim's blond co-worker Claire (Amber Valletta), who shows up at his burial and looks suspiciously like the Other Woman. There is some shady-seeming business involving Jim's recently jiggered life insurance.The movie veers toward horror, with Linda eventually dragged kicking and screaming to a mental hospital. Later, after we learn that the Hansons' marriage has been in unspecified trouble for some time, the movie takes a turn toward the spiritual, with Linda consulting a priest who regales her with mumbo-jumbo about how her confusion stems from a lack of faith.With a dozen loose strands still dangling at the two-thirds mark, ''Premonition'' abandons the psychiatric subplot to become a simple melodrama in which Linda, who has pieced together a timeline of past and future events, dashes to the scene of Jim's accident to try to prevent it.Ms. Bullock, who proved she could act in ''Crash'' and ''Infamous,'' returns to nonacting in ''Premonition.'' Embodying a paranoid but plucky Everywoman clutching at an elusive mate while trying to maintain her sanity, the best Ms. Bullock can manage is to seem glumly opaque.Mr. McMahon, with his Mephistophelean eyebrows, dead eyes and slack mouth, walks the same line between Mr. Right and Mr. Wrong as his character, Dr. Christian Troy, does in the cable series ''Nip/Tuck.'' All he has to do to suggest sinister motives is to twist his features into a sour expression and address his wife in a blas&#233; tone. Even in his Mr. Right mode, you'd be an idiot to trust him for a millisecond.''Premonition'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language.Premonition  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Mennan Yapo; written by Bill Kelly; director of photography, Torsten Lippstock; edited by Neil Travis; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, Dennis Washington; produced by Ashok Amritraj, Jon Jashni, Adam Shankman, Jennifer Gibgot and Sunil Perkash; released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Hyde Park Entertainment and TriStar Pictures.

So it can take a minute watching ''Andr&#233;,'' a play about the Revolutionary United States that opened on March 10 at the Metropolitan Playhouse, to remember that this is not a stilted look back at history through the lens of hindsight. ''Andr&#233;'' is the story of the British officer who helped Benedict Arnold to turn his coat. It was written in 1798, when the events it dealt with were still fresh, and the question of how the Republic should behave in wartime was crucial to the still-forming identity of a new nation. Plus &#231;a change.Written by William Dunlap, one of America's first theater impresarios, ''Andr&#233;'' is at least a pleasant historical curiosity. Elfin Vogel's production initially is slow going, involving lots of men in uniforms declaiming in hoarse shouts with rather dreadful accents. The intention, according to a program note, is to show the variety and social strata of colonial society, but even in Hollywood, fake accents inevitably sound, well, fake.But the pace picks up a bit. The play gains interest through presenting a genuine dilemma: Maj. John Andr&#233; (Nicholas Richberg) is indubitably a good guy, a bit of a dandy and a bit of a saint. But if General Washington (Ronald Roy Johnson Jr.) is soft on his prisoner -- caught in 1780 carrying incriminating documents after meeting with Arnold, who later escaped to England -- it will signal weakness to the British. The characters remain slightly one-dimensional, thanks to clunky text, in blank verse declaimed with too much seriousness. But there is genuine suspense about how the whole thing will turn out.''Andr&#233;'' is also, at heart, a good old-fashioned melodrama: an opera libretto in search of an opera. As the piece continues, the playwright gradually loosened his hold on earnest sobriety. First there are the outbursts of the callow officer Bland (Joseph Yeargain), who rages against Andr&#233;'s sentence and then learns that if Andr&#233; dies, his own father, a prisoner of war of the British, will be killed in retaliation. Then there's his mother, Mrs. Bland (Suzanne Savoy), whose joy at her husband's impending release turns to anguish at his impending death. Mr. Dunlap finally abandons all pretense at docudrama with the entrance of Andr&#233;'s lost sweetheart, Honora (Kathleen Dobbs), precipitating a love duet and then a mad scene as Andr&#233; is led off. Fortunately the playwright kept things fairly terse, even when turgid.''Andr&#233;'' continues through April 1 at the Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1833253"><summary>A O Scott reviews film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, directed by Ken Loach; Cillian Murphy stars; photo (M)</summary><text>In Ken Loach's movies -- he has made more than 20 in the last 40 years -- characters frequently argue about politics, which is only fitting, since the films themselves are political arguments. There is no point in combing through Mr. Loach's work for hints of ideological significance. Ideology -- Marxist, anti-imperialist, aligned with the perceived interests of the powerless and the marginal -- is the engine that drives his stories. The clarity and force of those stories is considerable, but their bluntness sometimes sticks in the craw of critics, who often scold Mr. Loach for lacking subtlety.But in watching ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley,'' his new film (which won the top prize at Cannes last year), it is possible to appreciate both Mr. Loach's passion and his sense of nuance. Set in Ireland in the 1920s, the film paints history in stark colors and observes as they blur and bleed. Mr. Loach and Paul Laverty, the gifted screenwriter with whom he regularly collaborates, leave no doubt as to who the villains are in this tale.From the start, when they raid an Irish farm, the British irregulars known as the Black and Tans are as brutal and sadistic as Hollywood Nazis. The atrocities they commit have an immediate radicalizing effect on the film's hero, Damien (Cillian Murphy), who abandons his plans to study medicine in London to join the armed uprising against the British.Injustice, in Mr. Loach's world, tends to be a simple matter. It resides in the unprincipled, dehumanizing exercise of power -- whether wielded by capital, the state, or an army of occupation -- against those who have none. The complications arise, and the arguments start, when the powerless try to fight back.Brutal as ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' is in depicting British acts of violence, it does not flinch from showing the harsh, sometimes heartless tactics of the Irish Republican Army flying columns. Among the most painful scenes are the executions of an informer and later a landlord, killings that foreshadow a turn from insurrection to civil war.Radical though he is, Mr. Loach is hardly a romantic, and the deep humanism that informs his best work -- a category in which ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' surely belongs -- is insulated from sentimentality by the sense that history is a long, bruising fight, a chronicle of compromise and defeat as well as of tentative triumph and provisional hope. He is also, as anyone steeped in the history of the modern left must be, acquainted with the factionalism and disunity that bedevils those who see themselves on the side of the angels.''Land and Freedom'' (1995) examined this theme in the context of the Spanish Civil War, in which anarchists and communists at times fought each other as fiercely as they fought Franco. The logic of rebellion in ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' has a similarly grim implacability. You start out fighting an obvious, odious enemy, and you will end up killing your friends.It's an old story perhaps, but Mr. Loach and Mr. Laverty tell it with enthralling -- and devastating -- economy and force. Beauty too. Mr. Loach and his cinematographer, Barry Ackroyd, use the grays and greens of the cloud-cloaked Irish countryside as a moody palette. Sometimes the human figures stand out in bold relief against the flat sky; at other moments they are wrapped in fog and smoke.Mr. Loach has always populated his films with superb actors (his knack for discovering them is uncanny), and the quality of the performances he elicits serves as a check against his more schematic polemical impulses. Mr. Murphy, fine-boned and ferocious, gives Damien a gentleness and sensitivity that shades toward fanaticism. He is a purist, an idealist, and therefore marked for a tragic destiny, either as monster or martyr.His performance is perfectly complemented by that of Padraic Delaney, who plays Damien's brother Teddy, a brave soldier but also a fatefully pragmatic politician. Between them is the marvelous Orla Fitzgerald as Sinead, a perfectly believable incarnation of an indomitable Irish woman.In 1921, after several years of fierce fighting, the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State, an event that split the Republican movement and unleashed a period of factional bloodletting, the Irish Civil War. The consequences of this strife propel ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' through its terrible final act, which is all the more chilling for being dramatized with such precision. Afterward it comes almost as a shock to recall that the Republic of Ireland today is a prosperous member of the European Union, and that even the Northern Ireland seems to have moved beyond sectarian violence.But the history presented in ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' hardly feels like a closed book or a museum display. It is as alive and as troubling as anything on the evening news, though far more thoughtful and beautiful.The Wind That Shakes the Barley  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Ken Loach; written by Paul Laverty; director of photography, Barry Ackroyd; edited by Jonathan Morris; music by George Fenton; production designer, Fergus Clegg; produced by Rebecca O'Brien; released by IFC First Take.

K.), plays Richard Cooper, an investment banker whose life is as bland as his name. Richard, in his voice-over narration, is the first to admit that his situation is enviable in many ways: He has a lovely wife named Brenda (Gina Torres), two cute small children, a spiffy house in the suburbs and a flourishing career at a reputable Manhattan firm.The problem, as you may be able to intuit from this checklist of bourgeois amenities, is that he's bored. He has reached a point at which existence settles into a series of pleasant routines and minor frustrations. In Richard's case one of these frustrations -- the sexual cooling of his marriage -- becomes the source of some potentially major trouble.''My marriage is frozen solid,'' he declares. He means to say that it's strong, but the metaphor sneaks up and traps him in an uncomfortable admission. To make matters worse, he delivers this diagnosis to Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington), a human blowtorch -- even without the cigarettes, she'd still be smoking -- aimed at the facade of Richard's comfortable, complacent life.Nikki, the ex-girlfriend of an old friend, shows up at Richard's office one afternoon, supposedly seeking a letter of recommendation. By caprice or design she ensnares him in a long, volatile flirtation, a relationship that, while not technically adulterous, is nonetheless tinged with furtiveness and guilty exhilaration.If the premise sounds familiar, that is in part because ''I Think I Love My Wife'' is a remake, at once free-handed and faithful, of ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' (1972), the sixth and last of Eric Rohmer's ''Moral Tales.'' Mr. Rock's affection for this source is evident in his careful restaging of some of its shots and scenes, even though Mr. Rohmer's wry, ironical temperament could not be further from Mr. Rock's candid, confrontational stand-up style.In attempting to synthesize the later French New Wave of the late 1960s and early '70s with the upscale African-American romantic comedies that flourished in Hollywood in the late 1990s, Mr. Rock has not only done his best work as a director and screenwriter but has also made an unusually insightful and funny mainstream American movie about the predicaments of modern marriage.There are some raucous set pieces and a lot of frank, jokey talk about sex, but ''I Think I Love My Wife'' is not after crude or easy hilarity, and Mr. Rock works hard to hold his aggressive, irrepressible comic personality in check. Though he has made great strides as a filmmaker -- his previous effort, ''Head of State,'' was a better idea for a movie than an actual movie -- he is still, unfortunately, not much of an actor.He is able, just barely, to impersonate a buttoned-up suburban professional, looking perfectly respectable in his suits but never quite conveying the inner life of the man inside them. Mr. Rock has a bit of a Woody Allen problem, in that any character he plays will always seem to be a transparent alter ego, and in the case of Richard Cooper this causes blurriness and confusion. Is this guy supposed to be Chris Rock or not? And if not, who is he supposed to be?Richard's everyman qualities, in other words, clash with Mr. Rock's irreverent individuality. But the movie still works, in part because the observational sharpness that characterizes this comedian's best performance work is sprinkled through the script. Without making race into a Big Theme, Mr. Rock and Louis C. K. nonetheless pepper the film with sharp insights into the black middle class, taking note of how the consciousness of race remains lodged in the fine grain of daily life. In front of her young daughter Brenda insists on spelling the words ''white'' and ''black'' instead of saying them, and Nikki, examining Richard's iPod, offers a piquant diagnosis of his monochromatic musical tastes.The key to the movie, in many ways, is Ms. Washington, whose flighty, needy, unpredictable character might have been better suited to Paris in 1972 than to present-day Manhattan. Nikki is a bit of a male fantasy, a dangerous temptress whose motives and feelings are as mysterious as they are intense, and whose attention is like oxygen to the sputtering vanity of a successful, sexually unfulfilled man.Luckily, Ms. Washington is as quick-witted and subtle as she is lovely, and she makes Nikki not just seductive but interesting, a quality that is crucial to the story's credibility. (Steve Buscemi, as Richard's wise, philandering colleague, similarly rounds out what might have been a flat, obvious role.)In short, ''I Think I Love My Wife'' is smart and likable, which is lavish praise in a season whose comic offerings have included ''Music and Lyrics'' and ''Because I Said So.'' The success of this movie also suggests, refreshingly enough, that not every Hollywood remake of a French movie is necessarily a crime against taste. I look forward to seeing the boxed set of Chris Rock's ''Moral Tales'' on my shelf, in alphabetical order right between Richard Pryor and Eric Rohmer.''I Think I Love My Wife'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some very frank and grown-up discussions of sex, though not much explicit depiction of it.I Think I Love My Wife  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Chris Rock; written by Mr. Rock and Louis C. K., based on the film ''Chloe in the Afternoon'' by Eric Rohmer; director of photography, William Rexer II; edited by Wendy Greene Bricmont; music by Marcus Miller; production designer, Sharon Lomofsky; produced by Mr. Rock and Lisa Stewart; released by Fox Searchlight Pictures.

Ripley, the hotshot comedy-writing team observed peddling their dubious wares in the documentary ''American Cannibal.'' As the movie observes them tossing around outlandish concepts, then trying to interest jaded cable network executives in their trashy ideas, you are tempted to wonder if the documentary, directed by Perry Grebin and Michael Nigro, is a put-on.One concept Mr. Roberts and Mr. Ripley invent: ''Virgin Territories,'' in which 10 men, all certified virgins, share a house where they are bombarded with pornography and tempted by sexy female visitors but forbidden to touch either the women or themselves. The one who remains chaste the longest gets the ultimate reward: loss of his virginity with a porn star.Never mind that some men might think that a paltry, if not a dangerously unhealthy, payoff. And never mind that the mechanics of certifying male virginity are never addressed, nor the methods of detecting furtive autoerotic release. It's the thought that counts.But the concept and its catchy slogan -- ''when you win it, you lose it'' -- fire the imagination of Kevin Blatt, a promoter who marketed the Paris Hilton sex tape and is eager to jump into the cesspool of reality television. Mr. Blatt is even more excited about another idea Mr. Roberts and Mr. Ripley pitch to him as a half-joking afterthought: ''American Cannibal.'' Contestants on this show would be transported to an island, starved and led to think that one of them would be eaten. The details are never spelled out.Mr. Blatt invests $100,000 in development money. Potential contestants are interviewed, told the show is called ''Starvation Island'' (minus the cannibal angle) and given a questionnaire in which they are asked if they would be able to eat their own fingers and toes.For some people, it seems, nothing is too humiliating or painful if it gets them on television. The six finalists are flown with a camera crew to the island of Vieques, off Puerto Rico, to shoot a pilot, and George Gray (of ''The Weakest Link'') is signed as host.Almost immediately upon reaching the island, the project collapses from sloppy planning, union problems and an injury to a contestant. As one thing after another goes wrong, the documentary itself is sabotaged by acts of God and legal problems. None of the tests the contestants endure are shown, and the ultimate fate of the injured woman is left unclear.The documentary illustrates the premise that if you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas. Until everything collapses, and the filmmakers are left grasping at straws, it's absorbing in a sick way. The fact that all the people we see in the reality-TV business appear to sneer at their own genre doesn't excuse their culpability for perpetuating that toxic phenomenon. Mr. Ripley, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Blatt, in particular, earn every failure and setback that comes their way.American Cannibal  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Perry Grebin and Michael Nigro; edited by Suki Hawley; produced by Mr. Grebin, Denis Jensen and Mr. Nigro; released by Lifesize Entertainment.

He was 99.According to news reports, he died at a hospital in Mexico City where he was recuperating from a fall at his house two weeks ago. The Treasury Department and the Inter-American Development Bank confirmed his death but gave no further details.Mr. Ortiz Mena, who went on to serve as the second president of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, oversaw a policy of fiscal prudence and public investment.Although Mexico's economy began to grow after the end of World War II, it was while Mr. Ortiz Mena was finance minister, from 1958 to 1970, that economic growth accelerated.''The achievements were impressive,'' Pedro Aspe, the finance minister in the early 1990s, wrote in an e-mail message. ''With a population growth double that it is today, the per-capita income was growing at an astounding 3.4 percent annually for 12 years.''During that time, economic growth averaged 6 percent a year while inflation often remained below 3 percent. Millions of Mexicans entered the middle class, and the country began its transformation from a largely rural economy to an industrial one.But after he left, two successive presidents embarked on economic policies characterized by runaway spending and excessive borrowing that undid many of his accomplishments.After Mr. Ortiz Mena's tenure, Mexico lurched from financial crisis to crisis for roughly a quarter-century. While a return to close fiscal management and a tight monetary policy have restored stability over the last decade, the economy has at times grown anemically.In an era of globalization these days, many of Mr. Ortiz Mena's policies -- like his protection of local industry and a policy of replacing imported goods with locally made ones -- seem outdated. Mexico has entered the free-market camp.Mr. Ortiz Mena was born in Parral in the northern state of Chihuahua on April 16, 1907. A lawyer by profession, he was a graduate of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He held a series of government posts before becoming finance minister under President Adolfo L&#243;pez Mateos and continuing under President Gustavo D&#237;az Ordaz.In 1970, he was named president of the Inter-American Development Bank, one of the World Bank's regional financiers, and he remained there until his retirement in 1988. During his tenure there, lending increased tenfold, to $40 billion in 1987 from $4 billion in 1970, the bank said.While the Inter-American bank concentrated most of its efforts during that time on lending to build Latin American infrastructure projects and heavy industries, Mr. Ortiz Mena also set up the bank's first financing operations for microenterprise.He resigned in 1988 at a time of tension over perceptions in the region that the Reagan administration was trying to control the bank.Mr. Ortiz Mena was a stalwart of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which governed Mexico for 71 years until 2000. As finance minister, he was considered a possible candidate for the presidency.In 1994, a dinner was held at his home at which the president of the party asked Mexico's top business executives to contribute $25 million each to the party. When an account appeared in newspapers, it was an enormous embarrassment to the party, although he was spared public outrage.Mr. Ortiz Mena is survived by his wife, Martha Salinas de Ortiz Mena, six children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</text></article><article id="1833284"><summary>Department of Defense confirms deaths of two US service members in Iraq</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,189 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

Moelis, the president of UBS's investment bank in New York, is threatening to leave the firm, according to people briefed on the matter.Credited with turning UBS from a small Swiss bank into a Wall Street powerhouse over the last five years, Mr. Moelis has told colleagues and friends that he has begun looking for opportunities elsewhere, these people said.He has floated the idea of starting his own advisory firm or private equity shop, or possibly joining another bank, but it remains possible that Mr. Moelis could stay at the company and may be angling for more authority, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about personnel matters.Rohini Pragasam, a UBS spokeswoman, said that Mr. Moelis was still with the firm and declined to elaborate.Speculation about Mr. Moelis has spread throughout the company and across Wall Street in recent days. On Wednesday, a prot&#233;g&#233; of Mr. Moelis, Jeffrey A. McDermott, who is one of three global co-heads of investment banking, said that he would leave on June 30 after six years at the firm.In an internal memo, UBS said that Mr. McDermott, who is based in New York, was leaving ''to pursue outside entrepreneurial opportunities.''The loss of Mr. Moelis would be a blow for UBS, which ranked first in advising initial public offerings globally and seventh in advising on global mergers and acquisitions last year, according to the research firm Thomson Financial.Around Wall Street, Mr. Moelis is known for his long list of big clients and for a long history in investment banking, including high-profile stints at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which he left in 1990 after the firm filed for bankruptcy, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, where he ran the Los Angeles office.But Mr. Moelis has had frequent confrontations with UBS's managers in Switzerland, who he believes have not used the balance sheet aggressively enough, especially as the private equity market has grown.He has been embarrassed by instances in which he committed loans to clients, only to be told by his Swiss bosses that he could not make the transaction.Mr. Moelis and Mr. McDermott joined UBS in 2001 as part of a sweeping transformation of the firm by John P. Costas, then the chief executive of the investment bank and now the head of UBS's hedge fund, Dillon Read Capital Management.Once he arrived at UBS, Mr. Moelis hired 70 investment bankers during his first three months, pulling in talent from competitors like Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.Among them was Mr. McDermott, who was then a managing director and co-head of investment banking for the industrial large-capitalization group at Salomon Smith Barney.</text></article><article id="1833299"><summary>Photo of mother and son inside wrecked building where they live in Grozny, Chechnya</summary><text>The admissions made by the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks illuminated and transformed the cases against him and the 13 other Qaeda leaders transferred last year from C.I.A. prisons to the Navy base at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba.In acknowledging last Saturday his role in more than 30 terrorist attacks and plots, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed certainly simplified the case against himself and may have effectively signed his own death warrant when he eventually faces a military trial.But those same statements, released on Wednesday by the Pentagon, may complicate the prosecution of his former colleagues.Speaking to a military tribunal that considers just the narrow question of whether Guant&#225;namo detainees were properly designated as enemy combatants, Mr. Mohammed was so expansive in his acceptance of responsibility that other defendants might be able to use his statements in their own defense.In a transcript of the hearing, Mr. Mohammed also disavowed information he had told Central Intelligence Agency interrogators about his accomplices, again potentially helping the other defendants.A revised version of the transcript released Thursday added another chilling confession. Mr. Mohammed said he decapitated Daniel Pearl, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, in Pakistan in 2002. The military said it had held back the passage about Mr. Pearl while it notified his family.That confession could figure in the case of Ahmed Omar Sheikh, who is appealing his death sentence in Pakistan for his role in Mr. Pearl's abduction and murder. Mr. Mohammed and the other Qaeda leaders will eventually face charges before military commissions that they are guilty of war crimes, many of which carry death sentences.Unlike the recent proceedings, before Combatant Status Review Tribunals, those trials will largely resemble ones before civilian criminal courts. Officials have said that they intend to charge the men this year and that those trials could start early next year.The trials of three less significant detainees, none of them among the 14 leaders, are expected to begin soon.It is not clear whether Mr. Mohammed was really involved in as many terrorism plots as he said or whether he was simply indulging in a penchant for drama and self-aggrandizement. Nonetheless, his confession could have a significant effect on the round of tribunals. Several lawyers said his statement could be used against him in other settings.''This statement is admissible and substantially hampers the ability of the defense to argue that he is not guilty,'' said David B. Rivkin, an official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush. ''The other side may argue that the poor dear was so stressed out by his earlier treatment that it had a lingering effect. That dog ain't going to hunt.''John Sifton, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said he questioned whether the statement read for Mr. Mohammed by his representative authentically reflected his views.''The grammar of it alone, when juxtaposed with his version of English, suggests it was prepared for him,'' Mr. Sifton said. ''It looked to me like it was printed out of whitehouse.gov.''But Mr. Mohammed in places amended and then expressly adopted the statement, telling tribunal officials that he was not under any pressure or duress as he did so. He later freely discussed aspects of his terrorism activities in an extended monologue to the tribunal.The debate over the consequences of Mr. Mohammed's admissions rekindled a larger one, about whether he and other terrorism suspects should be considered criminals or combatants. Mr. Mohammed embraced the administration view at the informal hearing on Saturday. He was, he said, a soldier. He compared his actions to the revolutionary zeal of George Washington, spoke on behalf of people he said were improperly detained after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and criticized American and Israeli foreign policy.By giving him that platform on a military level, the United States has dignified and legitimized a criminal, Mr. Sifton said, adding that could have been avoided by charging Mr. Mohammed with crimes in ordinary American courts.John Yoo, an architect of the administration's legal response to the Sept. 11 attacks who is now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, drew a different conclusion from the transcript.''K.S.M.'s statements show that he in fact was and is a treasure trove of intelligence information on Al Qaeda,'' Professor Yoo said, referring to Mr. Mohammed by his initials. ''He knew not just of past plots to attack the United States, but threats that were in motion at the time of his capture, threats that had to be stopped.''The criminal justice system cannot handle the demand both for an open trial with the right to remain silent and the need to collect that intelligence and act on it swiftly and secretly.''Mr. Rivkin said Mr. Mohammed's statement confirmed the correctness of treating him as a combatant rather than a criminal.''The only people who don't think we're at war are the critics,'' Mr. Rivkin said. ''We think we're at war, and they think they're at war.''In the transcript, Mr. Mohammed said he had made false statements to ''C.I.A. peoples,'' and he gave examples, though the military deleted most of the details. Although the transcripts were redacted, they hinted of the aggressive questioning of Mr. Mohammed in his more than three years in C.I.A. custody.They also showed some of the limitations of the hearings. Mr. Mohammed was denied what in criminal proceedings would be rudimentary protections, including, notably, the right to a lawyer.The ''personal representative'' provided to Mr. Mohammed by the military, an Air Force lieutenant colonel whose name was not released, recited a 31-point statement in which Mr. Mohammed confessed to a vast array of crimes.A criminal defense lawyer, by contrast, would have almost certainly advised a client to say nothing.The two roles are very different, said Jumana Musa, an advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, which has been sharply critical of the detention policies.''A personal representative is not a lawyer,'' she said. ''There is not privileged relationship. He can turn over any information he learns from the detainee, whether exculpatory or incriminatory.''A second high-value Guant&#225;namo detainee refused to appear before a status tribunal last Friday. But, through his representative, the detainee, Abu Faraj al-Libbi, submitted a comprehensive critique of the procedures used by the military.''No lawyer, either assigned to the detainee or by the detainee's choosing, has been made available to the detainee to assist in determining the nature of the evidence presented against him, its legality and its validity as evidence,'' Mr. Libbi's statement said. ''The detainee needs legal guidance as to what kind of testimonies and statements are enough to refute the evidence presented against him.''I am extremely keen to exercise my rights fully according the law of the United States.''Lawyers for some Guant&#225;namo detainees have asked the United States Supreme Court to hear their challenge to a recent law, the Military Commissions Act, that barred them from questioning the legality of their detentions in civilian courts through petitions for writs of habeas corpus.The hurried status proceedings over the weekend may have been intended to demonstrate to the court that an alternative procedure is available and operating.Professor Yoo said the military system was adequate and appropriate.''The C.S.R.T. and military-commission process,'' he said, using the initials of the review tribunals, ''are the best way to balance the wartime needs for the trove of intelligence that K.S.M. has, while still creating a process that reviews whether he should remain in detention.''NEWS ANALYSIS</text></article><article id="1833332"><summary>Matt Zoller Seitz reviews film Adam's Apple, directed by Anders Thomas Jensen; Mads Mikkelsen and Ulrich Thomsen star; photo (M)</summary><text>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Anders Thomas Jensen  In Danish, with English subtitles  Not rated; 91 minutesThe Danish writer and director Anders Thomas Jensen's 2005 feature, ''Adam's Apples'' -- about a neo-Nazi sentenced to community service at a rural church run by a sunshine-and-lollipops vicar -- is one of the latest examples of the post-''Pulp Fiction'' bloody comedy. It's also one of the weirdest, mixing glib humor with dead-serious spiritual inquiry.At first the film plays like a particularly grim sitcom. The glowering, bald Adam (Ulrich Thomsen, a star of ''The Celebration'' and the henchman in ''The World Is Not Enough'') moves into staff quarters at a church run by the young minister, Ivan (the frequent Jensen repertory company member Mads Mikkelsen, the blood-weeping bad guy from ''Casino Royale''), and nails a portrait of Hitler onto his bedroom wall. He grimaces through hs new job, which mainly consists of taking care of the church's apple tree.Other troubled church employees and parishioners are defined in broad strokes: a tubby, alcoholic ex-tennis pro, Gunnar (Nicolas Bro); a hot-tempered Arab immigrant, Khalid (Ali Kazim), who protests the misdeeds of global oil companies by robbing local gas stations; and a depressed woman named Sarah (Paprika Steen), who's dissuaded from aborting her out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Ivan, an improbably optimistic widower who believes his paralyzed and uncommunicative son in not only healthy but also a math genius.Mr. Jensen subverts the film's grim but frivolous wit with supernatural events. Some are dime-store DeMille. (The apple tree is infested with worms and attacked by giant crows.) Others are more slapstick: reverberating church bells knock Adam's Hitler portrait off the wall; a Bible, when dropped, always opens to the Book of Job. All have obvious metaphoric implications, but they're also literal events: manifestations of God's judgment.Smart-aleck comedy and spirituality aren't incompatible, but in ''Adam's Apples'' they cancel each other out. The film's cutesy, misanthropic characterizations; Scorsese-style beatings; and bloody, comic gunplay announce, ''People are deluded animals, God is blind or dead, and life is meaningless,'' but the supernatural events say the opposite, and Mr. Jensen's tone is so cagey that it's hard to tell if he has an opinion one way or the other.Nasty Adam is clearly headed for a fall into goodness, but along the way we have to endure overcooked scenes in which he plays Satan to Ivan's Jesus, torturing him with cynical statements about the futility of faith. Such scenes may seem daring on the page, but here they simply play as fashionably hip: a Quentin Tarantino remake of ''Going My Way.''MATT ZOLLER SEITZ''Adam's Apples'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for profanity, violence, sexual situations and various disturbing images.</text></article><article id="1833333"><summary>Matt Zoller Seitz reviews film My Brother, directed by Anthony Lover; Nashawn Kearse and Christopher Scott star (M)</summary><text>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Anthony Lover  100 minutes''My Brother'' is billed as the tale of two poor, orphaned siblings, the aspiring standup comic Isaiah (Nashawn Kearse) and the developmentally disabled James (Christopher Scott). It wants to be much more than that. At times it seems to want to counter 15 years' worth of Mayhem-N-the-Hood stereotypes all by itself, folding in commentary on the theological conundrums involved in accepting Down syndrome as God's will; the bond of Otherness shared by African-Americans and nonwhite Third World citizens; the perils of interracial romance; and the proper social function of standup comedy.''My Brother,'' written and directed by Anthony Lover, suffers from organizational problems, overly expository dialogue and a tendency to overreach (particularly a subplot in which Isaiah accepts a job as a courier for shady-seeming Middle Easterners and ends up embroiled in lame intrigue).But its earnest tone, moving orchestral score (by John Califra) and strong cast (including Vanessa L. Williams, seen in flashbacks as the boys' fiercely devoted mother) carry it past the rough patches. And from the early scene in which James makes himself a sandwich while absentmindedly dancing to hip-hop, ''My Brother'' anchors sentiment to reality.The movie's strongest element is the chemistry between the reflective Mr. Kearse and Mr. Scott (who really has Down syndrome). Improving on its obvious antecedent in ''Dominick and Eugene,'' their relationship feels real, not like a movie contrivance.MATT ZOLLER SEITZ''My Brother'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence and mild profanity.</text></article><article id="1833363"><summary>William Lee letter on March 9 article on vacation homes in Jerusalem neighborhoods</summary><text>To the Editor: ''Choosing Israel, Not the Hamptons'' (March 9) reports that Americans and other foreigners are buying properties in Israel as second or vacation homes. The article mentions a number of Jerusalem neighborhoods as ''areas where roughly half of last year's home sales were to foreigners.''What your report does not say is that before 1948 those neighborhoods were occupied by Palestinians who had moved from the crowded Old City or from villages, towns and cities throughout Palestine during the British Mandate period to build beautiful modern homes in the newly expanding suburbs within the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem.The prosperous Palestinian merchants and professionals who built these gracious homes and established the lovely neighborhoods were dispossessed starting in 1947, and their properties were confiscated. In the years since, those properties have been conveyed to others, but their rightful owners and their descendants -- officially classified as ''absentees'' -- remain scattered beyond Israel's borders, living as refugees and in most cases not even allowed to visit Jerusalem. If they were, they could only peek over the gates and gaze at the places that, according to your report, Americans and other foreigners are ''calling . . . home for at least a part of the year.'' Clearly ''home'' in this case has a bitter meaning for tens of thousands of Jerusalem's Palestinian refugees.William Lee  Brooklyn, N.Y.</text></article><article id="1833364"><summary>Marni Magda letter on March 9 article about off-season camping along California's coast</summary><text>To the Editor: Re ''California Coasting'' (March 9): Thank you for capturing the natural beauty of San Onofre State Beach park and specifically the San Mateo campground, in an ''unspoiled, oak-lined river valley'' where coyotes, quail, rabbits and owls bring us to peacefulness away from the pace of modern life.

He was 91.A spokesman for Walt Disney Studios, Howard Green, said yesterday that company officials had not been notified of his death until this week.During a 43-year career with Disney, starting in 1937, Mr. Lycett worked on more than 30 films, including ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ''Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Babes in Toyland,'' ''The Absent-Minded Professor,'' ''101 Dalmatians'' and ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.''In 1964, along with Peter Ellenshaw and Hamilton Luske, he won an Oscar for special visual effects for ''Mary Poppins.'' And in 1971, with Alan Maley and Danny Lee, he won another Oscar in the same category for ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks.''Mr. Lycett was a prot&#233;g&#233; of Ub Iwerks, a pioneer of animation and special effects who for many years was head of the Disney studio's process laboratory. They and other technicians worked together in the late 1930s to design a complex version of what was called the multiplane camera, a device that revolutionized animation by bringing depth to what had been a rather flat image. Mr. Iwerks, who died in 1971, had designed a simpler multiplane camera.In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Iwerks's son, Don Iwerks, a former chief of the Disney machine shop, explained that the camera separated a cartoon's celluloid image into three planes: its background, an intermediate scene and the characters. ''The fact that the planes could be moved independent of each other,'' Mr. Iwerks said, ''made it dimensional, in that objects in the foreground could move faster than the intermediate plane and then the background.''The more sophisticated multiplane camera led to the production in 1937 of ''Snow White,'' the first full-length animated feature. Profits from ''Snow White'' allowed Walt Disney to build the company's large studio complex in Burbank, Calif.Eustace Arden Lycett was born in Straffordshire, England, on Dec. 21, 1914, the son of Martha Constance Walley and William Arden Lycett. As a mining engineer, Mr. Lycett's father regularly moved with the family; they lived in Chile for years, and went to California in the early 1930s.In 1937 Mr. Lycett earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology. That year, he also married Mary Ethel Goddard, who died in 2004. Mr. Lycett is survived by four sons: Kenneth, of Fullerton; William, of Placentia, Calif.; Roy, of Corona, Calif.; and Victor of Anaheim, Calif.; a sister, Nora Robertson of Carlsbad, N.M.; eight grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.It did not take Mr. Lycett long to find work. He graduated on a Friday and, based on an interview two weeks earlier, started work at Disney the following Monday. Mr. Lycett was named head of Disney's special photographic effects department in 1958.His career there was not limited to the big screen. He helped design ''Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln,'' one of the most popular exhibits at the 1964-65 World's Fair in New York, and ''Rocket to the Moon,'' a major attraction at Disneyland.</text></article><article id="1833449"><summary>Richard S Pr&#65533;</summary><text>Richard S. Prather, a hugely popular mystery writer of the 1950s and '60s whose novels were known for their swift violence, loopy humor and astonishing number of characters with no clothes on, died on Feb. 14 at his home in Sedona, Ariz. He was 85.The cause was complications of respiratory disease, his friend Linda Pendleton said.Mr. Prather (his surname rhymed with ''bather'') was best known for his three dozen novels featuring the private eye Shell Scott, a 6-foot-2 ex-marine with a broken nose, a bristling white buzz cut and an ear ravaged by a bullet he took in the Pacific theater. Among the titles in the series, most published by Fawcett, are ''Find This Woman'' (1951); ''Always Leave 'Em Dying'' (1954); ''Joker in the Deck'' (1964); ''The Kubla Khan Caper'' (Trident, 1966); and ''Gat Heat'' (Trident, 1967).The Shell Scott novels have sold more than 40 million copies, according to the reference work Contemporary Authors. Most are now out of print.Though the writing may strike some modern readers as dated (''She'd just turned 21, but had obviously signaled for the turn a long time ago''), the books retain an ardent cult following, prized for their tongue-in-cheek irreverence and plots that carom between the self-consciously campy and the unapologetically bizarre.Where the stars of most hard-boiled detective novels were dour, cynical and soaked in alcohol, Mr. Prather's hero was cheeky, happy-go-lucky and soaked in alcohol. He collected tropical fish. He tooled around Hollywood in a canary-yellow Cadillac. (It was robin's-egg blue in later books.) Mainly, he ogled women (''frails,'' ''dolls,'' ''babes'' and ''tomatoes,'' in the novels' parlance), who were ubiquitous, available and, judging both from Mr. Prather's descriptions and the books' paperback covers, preternaturally well endowed.Reviewing Mr. Prather's novel ''Take a Murder, Darling'' (1958) in The New York Times Book Review, Anthony Boucher called Shell Scott ''as amusingly blithe a figure as the field has seen since the Saint.''If Mr. Prather's work had a unifying theme, it was the human body -- or, more precisely, the human body with nothing between it and the mild air of Southern California, where most of the books were set. In ''Strip for Murder'' (1955), Scott goes undercover in a nudist colony. He has no place to put his gun.In ''The Wailing Frail'' (1956), the hero knocks on a door only to have it answered by a woman ''nude as a noodle.''In ''The Cockeyed Corpse'' (1964), he infiltrates a western movie set by disguising himself as a rock. To the rock's delight, the film's cast turns out to be all female, and all naked.And so on.Richard Scott Prather was born on Sept. 9, 1921, in Santa Ana, Calif. He spent a year at Riverside Junior College, and from 1942 to 1945 served in the merchant marine. After the war, he worked as a clerk at March Air Force Base, near Riverside, before quitting his job to write full time. His first Shell Scott novel, ''Case of the Vanishing Beauty,'' was published in 1950. Mr. Prather also wrote under the pseudonyms David Knight and Douglas Ring.Mr. Prather's wife, the former Tina Hager, whom he married in 1945, died in 2004. No immediate family members survive.In 1986 Mr. Prather received a Life Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America. Among his other Shell Scott titles are ''Three's a Shroud'' (1957); ''Have Gat -- Will Travel'' (1957); ''Slab Happy'' (1958); and ''The Trojan Hearse'' (Pocket Books, 1964). He also edited a well-received crime anthology, ''The Comfortable Coffin,'' published by Fawcett in 1960.Mr. Prather kept Shell Scott alive for nearly four decades: his last books in the series, ''The Amber Effect'' and ''Shellshock,'' were published by Tor Books in 1986 and 1987. Happily for all concerned, the hero remained a virile 30 years old for the duration.</text></article><article id="1833450"><summary>Marc Torsilieri, 48, Provider of Ann</summary><text>Marc Torsilieri, who looked like a ginger-bearded lumberjack and played the part in splendid fashion by annually felling the Christmas tree for Rockefeller Center, died on March 12 in Somerville, N.J. He was 48, a little over half the age of most of the Norway spruces he helped find, transport, decorate and remove.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Susan.Mr. Torsilieri belonged to a clan of experts in moving big trees, when not attending to other aspects of their landscape business in Gladstone, N.J. For almost a generation, they teamed up with Rockefeller Center experts to conduct what may be the world's most distinctive arboreal talent search.The result of the annual search is a statuesque evergreen, usually exceeding 80 feet in height, weighing around eight tons and spreading 40 or more feet wide when fluffed out. Each year's tree is festooned with 30,000 lights on five miles of wire, with a star on top that is 9.5 feet in diameter and weighs 550 pounds.The tree rises majestically over the golden statue of Prometheus, happy ice skaters and more than 10 million visitors over the holiday season.The tradition began humbly in 1931 when construction workers put up a small tree; it gained steam in 1933 when formal tree-lighting began, then grew inexorably into today's televised extravaganza.Mr. Torsilieri and his brothers Guy and Dean ran the landscaping firm, Torsilieri Inc., that their father, Carl, began in 1968. They developed a reputation for sensitivity in moving trees and were approached by Rockefeller Center to handle its annual centerpiece, almost always a Norway spruce because of the brisk growth of that species.''They move 85-foot trees like they're delicate little china teapots,'' David Murbach, the center's chief gardener, said in an interview with The New York Times in 1993.Marc Torsilieri stood 5-foot-11 and weighed 240 pounds, but the 1993 article said he could ''climb to the top of a giant Norway spruce with the grace of a gymnast to tie up every tender little branch that would otherwise be snapped off during the trip to Manhattan.''Marc Torsilieri worked side by side with his 15 or more laborers. They delicately folded the branches inward so they would not break during the ride. The upper branches were flexible enough, but hingelike devices had to be made for the lower branches to make them bendable.They then used a specially constructed crane to place the tree in a tractor-trailer, originally designed to carry bridge girders. Its length telescopes to 100 feet, and it is used only once a year, for the big tree. A police escort accompanies it to Manhattan.But finding a tree comes first. Strangers' tips are many, but seldom work out.The search begins in late fall when evergreens stand out like jewels among bare deciduous trees. Then, Mr. Torsilieri told The Times, ''I'll mark which areas have lots of trees, and then we'll go back and comb them with a car.''After identifying a potential prize, they had to find the owner, a process involving knocking on the door, then leaving a card if necessary, and finally, sending a nice letter with a self-addressed envelope.Incentives for the owner include a small payment, some free landscaping (often including a new seedling) and a chance to get rid of an aged tree that has outgrown the yard. Specimens are usually found in the Northeast, but have come from as far away as Ohio and Canada.Expectations have grown. ''When we first started doing this, the trees were 60-footers,'' Mr. Torsilieri said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1996. ''They just kind of kept creeping up in size. I'm not quite sure how it got that way.''Marc Frank Torsilieri was born in Morristown, N.J., on July 28, 1958, and graduated from Delhi College of Technology in 1978 with a degree in horticulture. He lived in Three Bridges, N.J., and moonlighted as a mover of large sculptures for museums.In addition to his wife, the former Susan Fehrenback, Mr. Torsilieri is survived by two daughters, Liza and Phoebe; a son, Samuel; his parents, Carl and Lois; a sister, Carla J. D'Agostino of Marin County, Calif.; and his brothers, Guy, of White House Station, N.J., and Dean, of East Amwell, N.J.He liked telling Christmas tree stories, including one about a woman who rushed out in tears after hers was cut down. They turned out to be tears of joy: she had long thought her bathroom was hopelessly infected by mold, but it turned out that its sickly green color was from the tree's shadow.Once, with television cameras waiting in Rockefeller Center, the tractor-trailer got stuck in the mud in a Pennsylvania field, and the tree was a day late.''That year is forever etched in my mind: 1985,'' Mr. Torsilieri said.</text></article><article id="1833463"><summary>Photo shows Jorge Cerpa and Antonio Medina after they became first couple united under Mexico City's gay civil union law</summary><text /></article><article id="1833478"><summary>Defense Dept confirms deaths of six US servicemen in Iraq (S)</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,195 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

The compact, drafted by the Iraqi government and the United Nations, creates a framework for international aid to Iraq.At the same time, to reassure potential donors, it sets up targets for overhauling the government over the next five years, including establishing an effective justice system, building a credible civil service, guaranteeing human rights, improving security forces, disbanding militias, increasing oil revenues and improving financial management.After the meeting, Robert M. Kimmitt, the United States deputy treasury secretary, said: ''The Iraqis have done their part. The question now is, what will the international community do?''Bush administration officials often criticized the United Nations in 2004 and 2005 for not involving itself more deeply in rebuilding Iraq. But in an interview, Mr. Kimmitt praised the organization for taking an active role in the new development plan.''The engagement of the United Nations in the compact process has been absolutely essential to its success and absolutely essential to being where we are today,'' he said.Mr. Kimmitt was also asked about the presence in the hall of ambassadors from Iran and Syria, countries that the Bush administration has accused of meddling in Iraq. He said, ''Our view is that any country that wants to contribute positively to the success of the democratic, market-based transition in Iraq is welcome to attend these sessions and lay out their plans for doing so.''He said that the event on Friday was not a donor conference, but that countries would be invited to a ceremony next month at which they would be asked to make money pledges to begin realizing the reconstruction plan. He added that the Iraqi government had proved in its dealings with the International Monetary Fund and in its success in drafting an oil revenue-sharing law that it could meet benchmarks.Asked how the plan could move forward in Iraq under current conditions, Mr. Kimmitt said: ''In this business, you don't do things sequentially. You have to do it in a coordinated fashion.''He added: ''I think the new term now is 'clear, secure and build.' We have to make sure that clear, secure and build are all in the same room discussing coordinated action so that once an area becomes secure, as some areas of Iraq are, we can move very quickly to provide the economic reconstruction that they need.''THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ</text></article><article id="1833480"><summary>Maybe a House Is Now</summary><text>AS the American housing market boomed in recent years, Americans took billions of dollars out of their homes and used the money to buy other things. When the housing market faltered, an important issue became whether that would drive down other spending, further slowing the economy.So far, the evidence is that retail spending has weakened, but not by nearly as much as it did in the most recent recession, in 2001.The chart shows the year-over-year change in retail sales, using three-month moving averages to smooth out weather-related volatility.The February figures, released this week, show a year-over-year gain of 3.6 percent, far below the 9.6 percent increase posted in the summer of 2005, when the housing boom was in full swing, and even further below the 10.9 percent change in early 2000, just as the technology stock bubble was about to burst.The 2001 recession was unusual in that it was largely based on a decline in business spending, while consumer spending weakened but never turned negative year-over-year.Last year, it appeared that a slump in car sales was leading the economy down, but sales at car dealers have stabilized, and the latest figures show sales rising at a low 2.6 percent annual rate.Remarkably, the decline in housing so far has not decimated spending in furniture and home furnishing stores, despite the fact that such sales usually rise and fall with home sales figures. They are up 4 percent year-over-year now, and while that is less than half the peak rate of growth, it is well above the lows seen during and after the 2001 recession.But if Americans have shown a willingness to keep spending at furniture stores, they have shown less willingness to fix up homes, as reflected in spending at building materials, garden equipment and supply dealers. The latest figure shows a year-over-year decline of 3.2 percent. Just a year ago, spending in those stores was rising at a rate of almost 19 percent a year.The No. 1 chain in that category, Home Depot, has noticed the decline in sales, and evidently thinks that the cause is not just the economy. After an article on the MSN Money Web site produced an outpouring of stories of bad customer service from Home Depot customers, Frank Blake, the new chief executive of the company, sent in an apology . ''There's no way I can express how sorry I am for all of the stories you shared,'' he wrote. ''We let you down.''If the decline in growth of consumer spending continues, more retailers may conclude that they need to change the way they are operating. But so far at least, Americans have been willing and able to keep spending at rates that are not recession-inducing, even if they are far from the boom times of just a year ago.OFF THE CHARTS</text></article><article id="1833483"><summary>Nissan Chief to Step Aw</summary><text>The chief executive of Nissan Motor, Carlos Ghosn, seemed like the rare executive who could be in three places at once -- Japan, where he runs Nissan; France, where he is in charge of Renault; and the United States, where he oversees Nissan's operations in North America.But on Friday, he admitted that it was too much, even for him.Mr. Ghosn told employees that he would give up responsibility for Nissan's North American operations and focus on the revamping under way at Nissan and Renault.The move, which takes effect on April 1, comes a month after Nissan warned that it expected to post a lower profit for the 2006 fiscal year, the first drop since Mr. Ghosn became chief executive in 2001.Since he became president of Nissan in 1999, after Renault took a controlling interest, Mr. Ghosn has broken ground as a new type of automobile executive, stating bold goals and many times exceeding them.But in recent months, Mr. Ghosn has taken a far lower profile, starting in October when General Motors rebuffed his attempt to form a broad alliance. He did not attend this month's motor show in Geneva and did not plan to be at next month's auto show in New York, where he has been the dominant personality.The reason, analysts said, is that he has his hands full running two troubled companies.''His schedule required almost superhuman strength,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, president of Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives consumers car-buying advice. ''At some point you think something's got to give, and it appears that may have been Nissan sales over the last 12 months.''Nissan's sales fell 5 percent in the United States last year, when the company took a breather from a steady stream of product introductions over the last few years.It resumed its flow of new models last fall, when it introduced restyled versions of the Altima sedan and the Sentra compact. A new small crossover vehicle, the Rouge, is expected this year, as is an Altima coupe that looks similar to a luxury model, the Infiniti G35.Nissan sales are up 2.7 percent this year compared with the first two months of 2006.But in response to a sharp slide in its Japanese sales, Nissan said on Friday that it would move to a single shift from April to June at the Oppama and Tochigi plants, which assemble about a dozen models that include the March subcompact and the Infiniti Q45, a luxury sedan.Nissan said Hiroto Saikawa, the vice president for European operations, would assume Mr. Ghosn's duties for North America.His appointment came as Nissan reshuffled its management team. Its priority, Mr. Ghosn said, would be ''to act decisively on the multiple challenges facing Nissan and to boost our overall performance in 2007.''A spokeswoman for Nissan North America, Fr&#233;d&#233;rique Le Gr&#232;ves, said the company usually left senior managers in place for two years. But Mr. Ghosn had not made changes for three years and felt new assignments were overdue.''I think it was the right time for him'' to take the steps, Ms. Le Gr&#232;ves said. ''And it's just the right time for him to focus on the bigger picture for Nissan and Renault. He will continue to watch the U.S. very closely.''Ms. Le Gr&#232;ves said Mr. Saikawa would be based in Japan, where he is also in charge of Nissan's purchasing operations, leaving day-to-day responsibilities for North America to Nissan executives here.At Nissan, Mr. Ghosn has initiated three successive revamping plans, which collectively cut the company's debt, improved its profits and expanded its global sales, particularly in the United States, where he put himself in overall charge of its operations.But as Nissan was rising, problems occurred at Renault, where Mr. Ghosn had led a turnaround in the 1990s that honed his reputation as a restructuring specialist. Last year, Mr. Ghosn announced a recovery plan for Renault and began leading both companies.In the midst of that, Mr. Ghosn joined forces last summer with Kirk Kerkorian, then G.M.'s largest shareholder, to propose a three-way alliance of G.M., Renault and Nissan. But the discussions fell apart after G.M. demanded an upfront payment from Renault and Nissan to account for the value that it thought those two companies would gain from an arrangement.Though Mr. Ghosn had said he might seek another North American partner, he has since backed away from the idea of expanding the Renault-Nissan alliance. Neither company has taken part in discussions with DaimlerChrysler, which is talking to potential bidders for the Chrysler Group, a sale that may take place as soon as this spring.Although Mr. Ghosn has shied away from recent auto shows, Ms. Le Gr&#232;ves said he would be back in the United States this spring, for a speech in Washington and a visit to Detroit. She pointed out that Nissan would still be profitable for the 2006 fiscal year, which ends March 31.</text></article><article id="1833492"><summary>Florida, only state to sanction girls' weightlifting as high school sport, holds state finals in New Port Richey; photos (M)</summary><text>She was an Atlas of the exurbs, hoisting a 210-pound barbell over her ponytailed head and holding it there, arms just barely aquiver, while the high school gymnasium exploded in cheers.At that moment on a recent Saturday, Jessica Reynolds, 17 and weighing in at 261 pounds, broke the state record for girls' weightlifting, a high school sport sanctioned only in Florida and embraced, improbably, by girls of all shapes, sizes and athletic abilities.At an age when appearance often seals reputations, they squeeze into tight singlets, step on scales while their peers watch and grunt their way through bench presses, clean and jerks and other decidedly uncute moves.''It might not have been the most, like, girly or cool thing,'' said Hannah Feliciano, a willowy freshman at Sarasota High School who started lifting last fall. ''But I like the fact that I can prove to people that I also have, like, a rough side.''Or as Sara Hansell, a senior at St. Cloud High School who won her second consecutive title in the 154-pound weight class explained her passion for the sport, ''I get to say I'm stronger than most of the boys in my school.''No other state has officially adopted weightlifting for girls, as the Florida High School Athletic Association did in 1997, a sign that the perception endures of weightlifting as a sport for he-men and the occasional bodybuilding queen who slathers her preternaturally bulging biceps with baby oil.''I find it very surprising,'' said Jackie Metcalf, the weightlifting coach at Sarasota High School. ''because it's a great way to get girls involved for gender equity. You don't have to be a skilled athlete to do this.''The presence on many teams of cheerleaders -- who become better jumpers and fliers after lifting -- has helped remove the stigma from the sport, several girls said. Many wear bows in their hair at competitions, and at a recent meet, one wore pearls with her singlet. They share weight rooms with boys who admiringly call them ''beast.'' T-shirts emblazoned with ''Silly Boys, Weights Are For Girls'' and the like are de rigueur.''In our school, it's pretty much understood that weightlifting is O.K. and you're not a boy and you're not gross if you do it,'' said Leigha Nave, a senior at Spruce Creek High School in Port Orange who is the state champion of her 119-pound weight class.Extracurricular club programs for girls have sprung up around the country since women's weightlifting became an Olympic sport in 2000. But Florida, with 170 high school teams that have produced two Olympians and several dozen world team members, has ''set the gold standard'' for the sport, said Rodger DeGarmo, director of high performance and coaching for USA Weightlifting in Colorado Springs, the governing body that oversees Olympic lifting.''I think it's awesome for this group of girls because there's so many times you have to be tall, slender,'' said Judy Miller, Jessica's foster mother. ''With this, you can be any size.''At the state finals here, where Jessica captured the title for the third year straight, 240 girls competed in the bench press and the clean and jerk, in which a barbell is swiftly raised from the floor to shoulder height and then, after a pause that is harrowing to watch, overhead.Some chugged bottles of honey before they lifted -- the sugar high helps, they said -- while others sat silently in a corner of the gym, summoning their strength. They ranged from 93.6 pounds to 379.1, from featherweight cheerleaders to hulking softball players and even girls who never before dabbled in sports.''It doesn't matter how much you lift,'' said Jessica, a senior at Booker High School in Sarasota, after collecting her gold medal. ''It just matters that you're trying to make yourself better.''Some coaches have to recruit aggressively to build a team, correcting misperceptions along the way.''A lot of girls think if you do it you're going to get all beefy,'' said Alexa DeCristofaro, a senior at New Smyrna Beach High School who won first place in the 199-pound weight class. ''Well, you really don't. If you do it, you get toned, which is different from getting totally muscular.''In the decade since high schools here began offering girls' weightlifting, certain towns -- Port Orange (near Daytona Beach), Port Charlotte (near Sarasota), Fort Walton Beach (near Pensacola) -- have become known for their girl weightlifters. Tom Bennett, a coach at Spruce Creek High, said one of his former lifters won a slot at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs and others are bent on joining her.''The girls are very, very competitive -- in some cases more than the boys,'' said Mr. Bennett, whose team of 30 girls has won every state weightlifting championship since they began in 2004.The sport is far more popular in North Florida than in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, possibly because South Florida has more wealth and its young athletes gravitate toward ''upper class'' sports like tennis and golf, Mr. Bennett said. Altha, a speck of a town in the Panhandle, sent six girls to this year's state finals, while Miami sent none.Mr. Bennett's team practices at least 12 hours a week. Like other coaches around the state, he recruits from the school softball, soccer, cheerleading and basketball teams, with the promise that weightlifting will improve athletic performance in general.''It definitely makes them faster, more explosive, more flexible, stronger,'' said Richard Lansky, a member of the board of USA Weightlifting who runs an extracurricular club in Sarasota.Mr. Bennett, a former state champion himself, said that while he bawled out boys who did not make a lift, most of the girls on his team preferred positive reinforcement.''You can't go at them the same way,'' he said. ''If you yell at a girl when she misses a lift, she's like, 'Forget it, coach, I'm not going to do this anymore.' ''Some girls sobbed after missing a lift at the state finals in New Port Richey, about 25 miles north of Tampa. Others snarled as loud as any boy as they reached for the barbell, their coaches slapping their shoulders and barking encouragement. The bleachers were packed with parents and other fans, including many boys, screaming, ''Drive it!'' and ''Atsa girl!''Leigha, the Spruce Creek senior, said she loved the competitive aspect of lifting.''It's a rush, it really is,'' she said. ''We have boards in our weight rooms with the names of all the record breakers, and you're thinking about how bad you want your name on that record for everybody to see.''She broke the record for her weight class in the clean and jerk but failed to match her personal best, stalking off the platform with a look that foretold tears.But then, amid bountiful cheering, she lay on the gymnasium floor and laughed.</text></article><article id="1833494"><summary>March 15 Op-Ed article misstated number of state death row inmates who have been exonerated; 123 have been exonerated since 1973</summary><text>An Op-Ed article on Thursday, about the cost of death penalty cases, misstated the number of state death row inmates who have been exonerated.

Kennedy.And then all last week, reverent faux obituaries sprang up throughout the news media, from all sides of the political spectrum -- as though all along we'd been following Captain America's every illustrated move, always looking to him for inspiration, as if he hadn't been these past couple of decades just an above-average seat-filler on the Avengers superhero team.I'll admit to being a Captain America fan, and in mourning. But the fact is Cap was never the most popular of superheroes, even among Marvel devotees. He wasn't up there with Superman, never had Spiderman's movie clout or even the X-Men's. Cap's popularity hovered in the middle ranges, with Thor and Aquaman and Roger Rabbit.The Captain was a propaganda stunt from the get-go: a former art student, Steve Rogers, finds himself pumped up with a super-soldier formula, dressed up in stars and stripes, and sent out to the front lines of World War II to boost morale. The 1941 cover of ''Captain America Comics No. 1'' shows him, with that big letter ''A'' on his forehead, punching out Hitler. It's hard to escape the feeling that someone was trying too hard.His story lacked the resonant psychological depth of Batman's or Superman's origin, that mythic alchemy that makes a superhero concept jell. Compared with the cr&#232;me de la superhuman cr&#232;me, Captain America was more like the guy on a street corner dressed as a hot dog. Trapped in a branding exercise, he literally wrapped himself in the flag, red, white and blue painted onto chain mail, like a super-patriotic Renaissance Fair attendee.In death, Captain America's been given back to the marketing department -- everyone acting as though he's Uncle Sam, murdered before our eyes, when what he'd become over the years was something much more interesting.It takes a lot for a mid-level superhero to keep going -- up there on the store shelves every month, decade after decade, punching people out, aging out of context into an increasingly whimsical universe, trying to make it work. He never got promoted to, say, Major America or Colonel America. His shield was a gift, not from a god or alien visitor, but from F.D.R. For all his trouble, he got frozen in ice, fought his own clone and was reduced at times to playing pitchman for Twinkies.Though he never ascended to icon status, at least Steve Rogers wasn't the stiff, nationalist bully you'd expect. He was a surprisingly likable, even troubled guy I find it hard to be too cynical about.During the Watergate scandal he had a crisis of conscience and changed his name to the Nomad. He formed a partnership with the Falcon, the first African-American superhero. In his final adventure, he rebelled against a Superhuman Registration Act to license heroes in a kind of super-D.M.V. The man struggled, visibly and with great effort, to do what he saw as the decent thing.Captain America's failure to hack it as a national icon, to stay a cardboard cut-out, made him a compelling multilayered character. But, in a sense, it's also what killed him.Superman has his mythic quality and billion-dollar brand, and you knew, during the much-publicized ''Death of Superman'' story in the '90s, that he was always going to come back. But I cringed to see Cap take those bullets, panel by panel, a vulnerable man in a flag suit.It doesn't matter if it's just a P.R. stunt, or if it turns out a robot duplicate was killed in his place, or another Steve Rogers reappears from some alternative future dimension. In the end, Captain America was never the eternal symbol -- he was the publicity stunt who grew on the page into a failed but likable human being, and was therefore believably mortal. The Captain's co-creator, Joe Simon, is said to be sitting shiva for him.Making the late Captain America the legend he never was in life, or trying to read into his demise some allegory for our country's current crises, misses the point. Behind that vibranium shield, behind that kitschy Fourth of July mask, Steve Rogers was still just this art student who got drafted into a special assignment that lasted 65 years.So, sure, Superman has plenty of fans, but I prefer my superheroes like Cap: earthbound, struggling and all too human.Op-Ed Contributor Austin Grossman is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Soon I Will Be Invincible.''</text></article><article id="1833499"><summary>Elizabeth A Quick letter disputes March 13 article contending that sororities discriminate on basis of woman's weight or appearance</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''After Evicting Members, Sorority Is Itself Evicted'' (news article, March 13):As chairman of the National Panhellenic Conference, the coordinating organization for 26 international sororities, I take exception to your article about DePauw University's Delta Zeta chapter and your characterization of sorority life.Sororities are member-driven organizations.

Moments later, the husband, Jamie (Ryan Kwanten), goes for takeout, and the doll kills and mutilates his wife. Jamie, now a murder suspect shadowed by a smart-aleck detective (Donnie Wahlberg), drives to the couple's old hometown, buries his beloved and tries to learn if her demise had to do with an old local ghost story about a vengeful ventriloquist named Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts). Um, yeah.The director, James Wan, and the writer, Leigh Whannell (the team behind the controversially brutal ''Saw'' series), deliver the mandatory shocks and gross-outs, backed by dissonant bursts of music and made almost elegant by the cinematographer John R.

There's a curse on the town, all right; soon enough it's recounted by the hero's dad (Bob Gunton), a rich, tuxedo-clad paraplegic whose gorgeous third wife (Amber Valletta) has a Cheshire cat grin. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies.

Then try this whirlwind tour that has you (kind of) crisscrossing the continent, from an Ethiopian vegetarian's paradise to Mauritanian appetizers to a South African brunch, all in one weekend and for little more than the cost of a trip to New York. O.K., for exactly the same price as a trip to New York, since that's what it is.FRIDAY NIGHTFor many Americans, African food begins and ends with Ethiopian cuisine, with its slightly sour flatbread that's used instead of silverware to scoop up stews of meats and vegetables. So it makes sense to start the weekend with an Ethiopian restaurant.Peter Meehan, a Times food critic, recommended Meskel last November, saying that the bread, known as injera, ''works in incredible harmony with the stewed, simmered and saut&#233;ed meats, vegetables and legumes.'' He called the vegetarian combination plate ''the best thing to happen to East Village vegetarians in a long time.''A short cab ride west at Zinc Bar, Friday nights always feature African music. Depending on the weekend, you might find Source with Abdoulaye Diabat&#233;, an interracial New York-based African group, or the African jazz and funk of the African Blue Notes, led by the Cameroonian singer and guitarist Martino Atagana. Sets begin at 10 and 11:30 p.m. and at 1 a.m.; the cover charge is $7.If that's not late enough, you could end the evening at Cain, a chic Chelsea nightclub where the d&#233;cor is inspired by South African game lodges, and the bar is upholstered in zebra skin. Too bad there are no Chelsea consulates around that can grant you a visa for entry in advance; Cain's velvet ropes can be tougher to cross than some African borders.SATURDAYFor brunch, take the South African theme a few steps closer toward legitimacy at Madiba, a Brooklyn restaurant that serves what is a rarity in New York City: South African food. It's a warm place modeled after the informal bars known as shebeens, and the menu is full of things that you have probably never heard of, inspired by the mishmash of cultures that make up South African cuisine. On the brunch menu, that can mean anything from scones or toast coated with Marmite yeast extract to burgers in (monkey-free) monkey gland sauce, or frikkadels, South African meatballs.The city's Museum for African Art has no permanent exhibitions these days as it waits for its new building to be built at what will become the northern tip of Museum Mile in 2009. But you can check out African displays at other museums in town, including the Met, which has ancient art from Mali to Madagascar in its Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas collection; and the Hall of African Peoples in the American Museum of Natural History.(If museums aren't for you, you can sneak in a little ersatz Africa by going to see ''The Lion King'' on Broadway.)For dinner, try Les Enfants Terribles, deep in the Lower East Side on the eastern edges of Canal Street (kind of like Manhattan's equivalent of Timbuktu). The masks on the walls inside and tentlike canopy outside give it a game-lodge feel, and those who enjoy pronunciation challenges will enjoy ordering dishes from throughout Africa and the African diaspora (i.e. Brazil). There's the aum&#244;ni&#232;re mauritanienne, a compote of lamb, dates and prunes; and steak with spices from the Ivory Coast known as koroghofefemugu.You could linger at Les Enfants Terribles all night, downing caipirinhas and cocktails made with Senegalese dried bissap flowers, but if you prefer your crowded night spots to be less expensive, less chic and more sweaty, head to St. Nick's Pub, way up north in Harlem. (Take the F train to the B train, and have something substantial to read.)The little basement joint overflows with energy (and people) for the Saturday night African music jam, which features Abdoulaye Alhassane and a fluid group that changes as the evening goes on. There's no cover, but a $5 beer and a donation of a few bucks to the band mean you can stay as long as you want. The mesmerizing drumming and singing inspires a few couples to turn bits of the crowded space into tiny individual dance floors.SUNDAYAs your African weekend draws to a close, do you sense an elephant in the room? That's North Africa, left out, so far, in its entirety. New York's north-of-the-Sahara spots are way too much to cover in a day, so just sleep in, take it easy, with brunch at Barb&#232;s -- an Algerian-Moroccan spot that Frank Bruni gave one star in 2005.You can have eggs Benedict, if you wish, but there are plenty of North African-inspired dishes, too, like a merguez sausage or lamb brochettes. Uncork a bottle of Algerian Domaine El Bordj with that, and the rest of the afternoon will take care of itself.EXOTIC DISHES, UNFAMILIAR NAMESMeskel Ethiopian Restaurant, 199 East Third Street (Avenue B), East Village, (212) 254-2411.Madiba, 195 DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 855-9190.Les Enfants Terribles, 37 Canal Street (Ludlow Street), Lower East Side, (212) 777-7518; www.lesenfantsterriblesnyc.com.Barb&#232;s, 21 East 36th Street (between Fifth and Madison Avenues), Murray Hill, (212) 684-0215.Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street (La Guardia Place), Greenwich Village, (212) 477-8337; www.zincbar.com.Cain, 544 West 27th Street (10th and 11th Avenues), Chelsea, (212) 947-8000; www.cainnyc.com.St. Nick's Pub, 773 St. Nicholas Avenue (149th Street), Harlem, (212) 283-9728.For listings of African music in New York, www.afropop.org lists concerts and events.

In an attempt to fill the gap in the market between the city's backpacker hostels and high-end hotels, the first of a new chain of Extreme Hotels opened in November. The new chain, a joint venture of Protea Hotels, the London-based Extreme Group and Istithmar Hotels, plans to cater to adventure tourists in urban, extreme sports-oriented locations around the world. Gimmicks abound at the 130-room hotel -- there's even functional climbing wall set up on the hotel's exterior. In the lobby, the Extreme Sports Channel plays on screens above the reception desk, illuminated floor strips glow, and walls are decorated with skis and surfboards. Lining the lobby floor are orange-upholstered pod chairs with private surround-sound speakers and miniscreens blasting MTV. The extreme theme is a bit silly in the execution, but the staff is friendly and eager to be a part of something different.THE SCENEThe hotel may be targeting adventurers, but its aim is slightly off the mark. On a recent evening, the lobby bar and lounge was an incongruous mix of decidedly nonadventurous Europeans, middle-aged couples and lots of families with children (some with grandparents along for the ride). To the attentive staff's credit, most seemed to be having a good time.THE LOCATIONThe hotel is ideally situated at the base of the stunning Table Mountain, a little over a mile from the cable car station, so guests interested in hiking and climbing don't have far to go. The restaurants, bars and cafes on Long Street, one of the city's main nightlife strips, are a few blocks away, and excellent shopping at the outdoor flea market in Greenmarket Square in the central business district is just beyond.THE ROOMSNothing extreme about them. There are two room categories: standard and executive. The price difference is so slight, about $20, that it's worth the upgrade to what the front desk staff assured me were the biggest rooms. Our executive room was definitely not large (about 300 square feet, bathroom and curtained closet space included), but it was functional, with a flat-screen television (15 channels, including the ever-present Extreme Sports Channel), a comfortable king-size bed and an in-your-face view of Table Mountain.THE BATHROOMAgain, small but serviceable, with a glass-walled shower that looks directly into the bedroom. Sound also travels between the two rooms, making privacy pretty much impossible.ROOM SERVICEDuring the dinner rush at the restaurant, don't expect prompt delivery; our order of grilled chicken salad (45 rand, about $6 at 7.6 rand to the dollar) and a lukewarm ostrich burger (64 rand) took nearly an hour to arrive. Better food and service can be had on Long Street.AMENITIESRooms come with wireless Internet access (up to a limit; ask at reception for an access code). Next to the downstairs restaurant, there's a gaming lounge featuring an Xbox 360 connected to a large flat-screen television. The hotel's big sell is that it can arrange any manner of adventure activity: abseiling, shark-cage diving, mountain biking, BASE jumping, kite-surfing. A menu of options is in each room.THE BOTTOM LINEA fun, affordable change of pace for a place to stay, if you don't take it too seriously (for 1,000 rand a night, or about $132, for an executive room, you don't have to). Though the appeal may be lost on people who are old enough to have moved out of their parents' home, it's a safe bet that there's no hotel in town more entertaining for the 13- to 21-year-old set.Extreme Hotel Cape Town, New Church Street and Victoria Street, Cape Town; 27-21-488-2555; www.extreme-hotels.com.BONNIE TSUI  CHECK IN / CHECK OUT</text></article><article id="1833667"><summary>Sharon Otterman travel article on sights worth exploring in Siwa, Egypt; photo; map (M)</summary><text>RIDING a sandboard down a 70-foot dune in Egypt's Great Sand Sea takes a bit of bravado. But the golden sand is soft, and falling is unlikely to result in more than a face full of powder.Deciding whether to push off the edge is what passes for stress in Siwa, a verdant Egyptian oasis with mud-brick fortresses in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Despite being connected by paved road to the rest of Egypt since the mid-1980s, Siwa is still remote -- about 350 miles west of Cairo across mostly featureless desert. It remains among the most chilled-out spots in the country, which may explain why this tiny oasis now has about 15 hotels.A typical day in Siwa consists of renting a rickety bicycle from a handicraft shop in the dusty main square (10 Egyptian pounds per day, or $1.75 at 5.7 pounds to the dollar) and pedaling through palm groves toward one of dozens of natural springs. Cleopatra's Bath, a marvel since antiquity, feels hot in the early morning and cool at midday. Like all of Siwa's springs, it is open to visitors and is free.Perched on a nearby hillside is another must-see attraction: the ruins of the Temple of Ammon. The limestone structure, which Alexander the Great visited in 331 B.C., was once home to one of the ancient world's most renowned oracles.For those seeking adventure, towering dunes ring the town. Sandboarding tours and equipment can be arranged at any hotel or handicraft shop. A half-day including boards costs about 400 pounds per jeep. Guides like Mohammed Zait (20-10-389-6756; zaitsafari@yahoo.com) also offer overnight camping trips, with blankets, grilled chicken and Siwan sing-alongs around the fire (700 pounds a jeep).Not that the village lacks beds. Budget travelers are the bread and butter of Siwan tourism, and many stay at concrete block buildings like the Palm Trees Hotel (Sharia Torrar; 20-46-460-2204), which offers no-frills doubles at about 35 pounds a night.But luxury travelers are starting to arrive, spurred largely by a Cairo businessman, Mounir Neamatalla, who is seeking to turn Siwa into Egypt's premier eco-tourism destination. His exclusive $400-a-night Adr&#232;re Amellal (Gaafar Mountain Road, 202-736-7879, www.adrereamellal.net) resembles a traditional mud brick village tucked between a white table-top mountain and an azure salt lake. Opened six years ago, it is illuminated entirely by lanterns and candles. Gourmet meals and all activities are included in the price.Mr. Neamatalla's company also runs the Shali Lodge (Sharia Subukha, 20-46-460-1299), which offers handicraft-filled suites for $45 a night, and the Albabenshal (Market Square, 20-46-460-1499), which opened last month inside restored 19th-century mud homes. Doubles start at $45. You can contact either hotel at info@eqi.com.eg.Nights get cold, so in the winter (Siwa's prime tourist season, when temperatures range from 75 degrees in the daytime to 45 degrees at night), head for a campfire. A cozy and popular spot is Nour al-Waha (Sharia Subukha, 20-46-460-0293), an open-air restaurant just off Market Square that serves pungent Siwan lamb stew (15 pounds).A few days in Siwa is enough to convince even the most jaded travelers of its throwback charms. ''Siwa is a unique spot on the planet,'' Mr. Neamatalla said. ''Rope is still woven from palm leaves in the oasis, and ink is still squeezed from pomegranates. And there's still a generosity of spirit, an authenticity and a frankness, that is very captivating.''SURFACING | SIWA, EGYPT</text></article><article id="1833670"><summary>Danielle Pergament reviews restaurants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; photos; map (M)</summary><text>ETHIOPIA is not a country people go to for food. But despite its lack of culinary fanfare, Addis Ababa, the capital city, has a rich and unexpected food culture. And more than just great meals, this is food that comes with a story.This is a country that serves up grass-fed beef and organic vegetables by default. There are no trendy macro-organic-vegan movements; rather, the livestock graze in open fields because there are no factory farms, and vegetables are rarely treated with pesticides because farmers can't afford the chemicals. Going there is a step back in time, literally -- Ethiopians follow a version of the Julian calendar, so the year is 1999, and Ethiopia will have its millennium celebration on Sept. 12.On a trip to Addis Ababa last year, I became increasingly intrigued with the cuisine. Everywhere -- from dingy streets to polished hotels -- I saw people of every age, class and occupation eating the same food and embracing the same traditions. The food is a source of national pride, and a daily reminder of this country's history.There are no appetizers or desserts in Ethiopia. Chefs do not craft menus to whet the appetite with an amuse bouche. Food has a primal role: to be filling, nutritious and packed with as much flavor as possible, whether it's spicy chickpea hummus with caramelized onions, or grilled chicken dripping with a sweet yogurt sauce.Even at the city's handful of high-end restaurants (the ones with table service and uniformed servers), there is an unspoken obligation to provide true sustenance. This is a country, after all, that suffered some of the worst famines of recent decades.And at the heart of every Ethiopian meal is injera. Basically a pancake -- or more accurately, a really, really big pancake -- injera is made from tef, a sour-wheat-like grain that is mixed with cool water and a pinch of yeast. But unlike a pancake, it isn't flipped over, so the topside remains spongy, the better to sop up the vegetables and meat in the saucelike wat (sometimes spelled wot or wett) that is ladled on top. In a country where utensils are scarce, injera is not only your dinner plate, it's also your knife, fork, spoon and sometimes napkin.When a platter of injera arrives at the table, covered in dips of fresh, locally grown vegetables and farm-raised meats, it is immediately torn apart by everyone within arm's reach. The ritual is as much about silent gratitude for what the land has offered, as it is about digging into a great meal.HabeshaThe first place I tried injera was at this candlelit tukul, a traditional hut with low wooden tables and colorful ceiling murals on the city's main drag, Bole Road. As I sat down with my friend Tariku Warigtay, a local guide, local residents were drinking St. George beer, and pretty waitresses in white cotton dresses were scurrying about.After a moment, a young waitress approached with a silver tray and pitcher. In the tray was a bar of soap.''It's for washing your hands,'' Tariku explained. ''There are no utensils, so we must have clean hands.''It was the most decadent hand washing I've ever had: after I soaped up, the waitress poured warm water over my lathered palms, then gave me a warm towel. She lighted a stick of incense on our table, and the room filled with the scent of sandalwood. A minute later, she brought over two bottles of icy St. George, and as far as I was concerned, the meal could have almost ended right there.Luckily, it did not. Tariku ordered the specialty of the house, injera with mixed-vegetable wat. Our injera arrived on a woven grass mat otherwise bare until the waitress returned with a collection of ceramic bowls. On our injera she spooned saut&#233;ed spinach with caramelized onions, spicy potatoes with red peppers, yellow lentil hummus, fried green beans with garlic, mashed chili peppers, refried beans with tangy pepper, crushed chickpeas and a crisp, green salad.I ripped off a small piece, and gingerly dipped it into the chickpea sauce. Then I watched how Tariku -- who's been eating the stuff for 30 years -- approached his half. There is nothing delicate or refined about eating injera. He ripped off big sections and dunked them in the savory dips until his fingers were dripping with onions and spinach. I rolled up my sleeves and joined him.Eating injera is a sensory feast -- the sweet smell of sandalwood, the rhythmic drumming from a trio of musicians, sporadic bursts of flickering candlelight, and a sweet and spicy meal that clings to my fingers. All five senses are abundantly fed, and the entire meal comes to only 100 birr, or roughly $11 at 9.4 birr to the dollar.AgelgilAcross town, down a treacherously bumpy and forlorn dirt road, is one of Addis's swankiest restaurants, Agelgil. This is where the businessmen, diplomats and the Italian-suit-wearing crowd come to feast.The bar is more of a lounge, with a canopy of dried palm fronds -- you'll think you've landed in Los Angeles. But walk in back, to the dining room with its traditional art, big wooden tables and trays made of animal skins for serving injera, and it's clear that this place is authentically Ethiopian. There's also a small stage in the center.We parked ourselves at a table in the middle of the room and perused the menu -- injera with assorted meat or vegetable wats, teps (spicy fried lamb or other meat) and a fajita-like dish of sizzling lamb, beef or chicken with peppers and onions. Main courses cost 50 to 100 birr.This night's dinner consisted of assa kitfo, or chopped fried tilapia. It arrived on injera, and with wedges of flat bread, along with traditional vegetable wats -- potatoes, peppers, beans and onions in spicy sauces, all delicious. But the assa kitfo is truly stupendous. This time, I was not shy about digging in.I asked Selamawit Tekeste, the manager, how the assa kitfo is prepared, and she was coy. ''We are the only place you can find this dish,'' she said. ''We can't give out our secret.''From what I could tell, the recipe calls for batter-fried tilapia, mixed with onions, chili peppers, spicy sauce and something else I can't quite place. Ms. Tekeste was pleased. ''It's the part you don't know that keeps our customers coming back,'' she said.Well, that and the dancing girls. The draw at many of the restaurants in Addis Ababa is as much the entertainment as it is the food. At Agelgil, two men and two women, in tribal dress from the southern Oromo region, twisted, vibrated and shook in several highly choreographed dances, culminating with the two men performing a traditional spear dance in baboon wigs (yes, real, and no, not legal).The meal ended with a coffee ceremony -- a ritual inherited from the countryside. A waitress came to our table and roasted coffee beans over hot coals, fanning the smoke under our noses. She then ground the beans in a mortar and pestle, poured the grounds into piping hot water and filled our espresso cups. As she left, she sprinkled sweet incense leaves over a small bowl of smoldering coals.When the incense burned down, it was time to leave.Teshomech Kitfo HouseThe top of the food chain in Addis Ababa is kitfo -- raw, spiced beef -- and nowhere does it better than the Teshomech Kitfo House, hidden down a bumpy, unpaved road flanked by abandoned dwellings and small flocks of sheep. Two iron gates and a mammoth acacia tree marked its entrance; this popular restaurant, it seems, is only for those who know its whereabouts.The speakeasy vibe continued inside. There were no menus, the clientele was entirely well-dressed local residents, and there was only one thing to order: kitfo, which literally translates to ''diced into pieces'' in Amharic. It is the favored way to eat meat in Ethiopia, for those who can afford it (an order of kitfo at Teshomech costs 33 birr, about $3.55).The owner, Antonios Tekle Mariam, a tall, affable man, told me that he named the restaurant after his wife, Teshomech. But it was not time for small talk -- he weaved me through the patio and dining room packed with a lunchtime crowd, past a yard where banana palm fronds and cabbage were drying in the sun, and into his kitchen.In one room, three women in white butcher's coats were chopping up raw meat with machetes, discarding fatty pieces and neatly arranging the choice ones. The meat was brought to a second room, to be spiced, seasoned and occasionally saut&#233;ed.''You can have the meat cooked if you like,'' Mr. Mariam said. ''But real kitfo is raw. It is just warmed for a moment and served.''Actually, it's a little more than that. I watched as a teenage sous chef poured melted butter over the raw meat, warmed it in a wok (meat slightly warmed like this is called leb leb) and sprinkled it with a bright orange powder known as mit mita, a fiery mix of red pepper, mustard seed and salt.Once it was blended (but still quite raw), she scooped the meat onto a banana leaf next to three sides: grated cheese, drawn butter and a cabbage, cheese and pepper sauce. A small wrap of injera was added before the banana leaf was whisked off to the dining room.I was squeamish about eating the kitfo, but my curiosity got the better of me. It was faintly oily from the butter but warm and spicy, not unlike steak tartare, but with more kick.''Anyone can prepare kitfo,'' Mr. Mariam said, as we watched the women scurry about the kitchen, armed with machetes and wooden gavels. ''But kitfo comes from the Gurage region. I am from the Gurage region, and everyone in Addis knows I make the best kitfo.''He paused and took in the surroundings again -- deftly sliced sides of beef, neat rows of flank steaks pounded paper thin, a table piled high with assorted ground meat. Then he smiled and made his only joke of the day: ''It's in my blood.''Tarik HouseJust when I didn't think it was possible, I got even closer to the source of kitfo. The Tarik House is a white clapboard butcher's stand in the Lideta neighborhood, recessed a few feet from the road and barely larger than the two men I found inside.The men, each in a white butcher's coat, silently sliced up a side of beef. It looked like something from a meat locker, except it was not cold. In fact, the cows hanging on the wall are never frozen, going swiftly from organic grass fields to these racks, with a brief stop at the slaughterhouse.But Tarik House is not only a butcher shop, it is also a restaurant. And here's the thing: there's no kitchen. The dish of the house is tire siga, or raw meat.Unlike kitfo, tire siga is not mixed with warm butter or heated on the stove or served on a pretty banana leaf. The butchers carve generous slabs of beef while it's hanging on the hooks, slice it into fist-sized pieces and deposit it, with no frills, on a metal tray. And they can't fill orders fast enough.The loyal customers, mostly men, sit outside at flimsy fold-up tables, diving into the platters before them. One of them when we were there was Solomon, a friend of Tariku who lives nearby.He cut bite-size pieces of meat with a crescent-shaped carving knife. He dunked one into a dish of mit mita, squirted a lime wedge on top, and wrapped it in a piece of injera and ate. He washed it down with chilled red wine. The meal costs 40 birr for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of beef (most people get half a kilogram).This time, I could not do it -- I dunked the injera in the mit mita, squirted the lime juice on, and found it plenty flavorful without the meat. Yet when I saw Solomon's face, I could not help thinking I was missing out.Occasionally, the Tarik House will fry the meat for a moment on a hot plate if the customer is queasy about raw beef. That's how Chuchu, a grumpy regular who goes there for lunch daily, prefers it.''I never eat raw,'' he said, waving his index finger for emphasis. ''It must be cooked.''A few patrons looked up briefly and dismissed him -- they've heard this speech before.''Some of my countrymen are out of their minds,'' Chuchu continued. ''Raw meat is only for the lions.''THE LAND'S OFFERINGPrices are for dinner for two with drinks.Habesha Restaurant, Bole Road near the Wollo Sefer junction; (251) 551-8358; 120 to 170 birr, or $13 to $18, at 9.4 birr to the dollar.Agelgil National Food Restaurant and Hotel, old Villa Verde house in the Meskel Flower area; (251) 011-465-3299; 200 birr.Teshomech Kitfo House, 636 Haile Gebre Selassie Road; (251) 618-2442; about 70 birr.The Tarik House, Lideta area, across from the Lideta church; about 60 birr.Tariku Warigtay charges $50 a day for a restaurant or shopping tour of Addis Ababa; e-mail: gltguide2000@yahoo.com.CHOICE TABLES | ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA</text></article><article id="1833671"><summary>Stockholm nurse Johanna Doshe comments on visit to Zanzibar, Tanzania; photo (M)</summary><text>Johanna Doshe, 32, a nurse from Stockholm, traveling with a friend (not pictured): ''We celebrated my friend's 50th birthday on a safari tour in Kenya, and after one week, we traveled to Zanzibar to relax for another week, to look around and take some swimming tours and dolphin tours and go snorkeling.

It started out as a pit stop on the Kampala-Mombasa railway, and today many tourists look at it the same way: a place to stop for the night, resupply and then leave at first light for a safari or jaunt to the beach. But the city, Kenya's capital, is emerging as a destination in itself. It has great restaurants, endless shopping, classy colonial-era hotels and plenty of wildlife within the city limits. You can play with baby elephants and hang out with giraffes and then dine on all the ostrich and crocodile you can eat. It's a thoroughly African city with a whiff of the old English era. True, Nairobi gets a bad rap for crime, but if you avoid cruising around late at night and keep a careful eye on your stuff, you shouldn't have any problems. Many first-time visitors say they are surprised by how comfortable they feel in the city.Friday5 p.m.  1. Top Hats and Tails  To get a taste of Kenya's lingering colonial atmosphere, drop in at the Lord Delamere Terrace and Bar in the Norfolk Hotel, which opened in 1904 (Harry Thuku Road, 254-20-216940; www.fairmont.com/norfolkhotel). Porters in top hats and tails wheel luggage through the courtyard while servers in starched white uniforms scurry around with trays of food. The terrace bar is an ideal place for a Tusker, Kenya's native beer (240 Kenyan shillings, about $3.80 at 71 Kenyan shillings to the dollar). The bar is named for Lord Delamere, one of Kenya's most famous British settlers, who in the early 1900s made it fashionable to play house on the Dark Continent.8 p.m.  2. A Protein Banquet  For dinner on your first night in town, head to Carnivore, one of the most famous restaurants in Africa. It's a flame-lighted palace devoted to barbecued meat -- called nyama choma -- that would make Dr. Atkins jump for joy (Langata Road, 254-20-605933; www.tamarind.co.ke/carnivore). Expert carvers in zebra-striped uniforms patrol the dining room with large metal skewers loaded with meat: camel, beef, chicken, pork, lamb and crocodile, to name a few. Don't miss the ostrich meatballs. For 1,550 shillings, you can eat all the meat you want, as well as soup, salad, bread and dessert. All of this must be washed down with a classic Kenyan cocktail -- the dawa -- made specially at your table by the dawa man who has a wooden tray with all the ingredients (vodka, sugar, honey and lime) strapped to his stomach (400 shillings). Don't worry if you drain your glass quickly. The dawa man is never far away.Saturday11 a.m.  3. Motherless Elephants  O.K., so how many places can you see a knee-high baby elephant guzzling milk out of a bottle? Or holding out its trunk for a massage? This is the kind of T.L.C. that the elephants get at the David Sheldrick elephant orphanage (254-20-891996; www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org) near the Langata neighborhood, about 25 minutes from downtown. It is open every day to visitors from 11 a.m. until noon. It's a nonprofit organization (but one that charges 300 shillings a person to enter) that rescues baby elephants whose parents have been killed by poachers or felled by disease. As the little elephants march into the viewing area in purple blankets, guides explain some basics of elephant behavior. The elephants are highly intelligent but needy, too. The workers here actually sleep in the stalls with them until they get too big. Then they take them back to the wild and stay with them for six months in the bush until they are ready to live on their own.12:30 p.m.  4. Feed the Giraffes  Not far from the elephant orphanage is the Giraffe Center, open every day from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. (254-20-891658; www.giraffecenter.org; 500 shillings). Giraffes amble right over to you to snack on peanut pellets from your hand. If getting licked by a foot-long tongue and hit with musky giraffe breath isn't your idea of fun, there's also a cafe, a gift shop and a tortoise pen. If you're really into giraffes, Giraffe Manor is right next door, a colonial-era home that has been turned into a luxury hotel where you can feed the animals from your room.1:30 p.m.  5. Feed Yourself  Humans need to eat, too. For lunch, try one of Nairobi's choice alfresco spots, the Talisman, at 320 Ngong Road, just beyond the Karen roundabout (254-20-883213). Admire the Talisman's quintessential Kenyan style -- its half-indoor, half-outdoor architecture, with a colorful bar, low couches and lush gardens. The menu is a tasty jumble of curries, stir fries, pastas and meats, with specials every day. Don't miss the feta and coriander samosas as an appetizer (500 shillings). Lunch, including a drink, runs about 1,400 shillings.3 p.m.  6. Remembering Karen Blixen  The Karen neighborhood, a 20-minute drive from downtown Nairobi, is named after Karen Blixen, the Danish baroness who as Isak Dinesen wrote ''Out of Africa.'' She lived in Kenya from 1914 to 1931, and if you want a heavy dose of colonial times, you can visit the Karen Blixen Museum (Karen Road, 254-20-882779; www. www.museums.or.ke/karen), which was her house, and see some of her old things, mixed with props from the movie (800 shillings, open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.). At no charge, you can soak up the million-dollar view of the distant Ngong Hills, which inspired Blixen and countless others to romanticize this part of the world.4:30 p.m.  7. Safari, the Easy Way  If you're still feeling active, head to the Nairobi Safari Walk inside the headquarters of the Kenya Wildlife Service (Langata Road; 254-20-600800; www.kws.org). Follow the winding stone paths and suspended boardwalk for glimpses of lions, leopards, rhinos, ostriches and zebra. There are cheetahs, too, some quite friendly, and for a few extra shillings, you can pet a very large cat. The safari walk is open every day from 8:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. and costs 710 shillings.7:30 p.m.  8. Taste of India  It's dinner time, and time to dive in to Nairobi's rich Indian culture. Decades ago the British brought workers from India to help build the East African railroad stretching from Mombasa to Kampala. The result today is a flourishing Indian community with all-Indian malls and countless Indian restaurants. You can't miss with Anghiti, which has two locations, the livelier at the back of the New Rehema House off Rhapta Road in Westlands (254-20-4441258). Start with some papadum and a passion fruit lassi, followed by chili paneer as an appetizer. Some of the best dinner bets are chicken madras with methi naan, fish masala and paneer lababdar. Dinner for two, about 1,500 shillings.9:30 p.m.  9. Ready for a Nightcap?  Before turning in for the night, head to the Mercury Lounge, one of Nairobi's hippest places to grab a late-night drink (254-20-4451875; ABC Place, off Waiyaki Way). Picture comfy couches, mood lighting and inventive cocktails. The crowd is a mix of locals and tourists. Take a sip of a Luv-in-ton, a fruit juice, vodka and amaretto concoction, which was called Maternity Leave before that name was considered too risqu&#233; (375 shillings). The tapas here are imaginative, too, like the beef on toast (530 shillings) and micro veggie burgers (300 shillings).Sunday10 a.m.  10. Curios and More  Your final morning is the perfect time to load up on souvenirs. City Market, an enormous tabernacle-shaped building on Muindi Mbingu Street, is open daily from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. and on Sundays from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. It's ground zero for Nairobi's thriving curio trade, and has all the carvings, cloths, masks, bags, fruit and flowers you could ever want. Beware: if you haven't honed your ''no, thank you'' skills beforehand, you might come out dripping in beads, holding a spear and looking like a Masai warrior. For more upscale gifts, visit Zebu (254-20-3864665), a leather goods shop in the Junction Mall that sells handbags, shoes and clothes designed by Annabelle Thom, a local artisan. Then there's Kitengela Glass (254-20-6751858; www.kitengela-glass.com), which sells stylish blown glassware at three different shops around Nairobi, including one at the Junction Mall. Nairobi also has interesting jewelry, like the contemporary African work of Adele Bejak, who runs her studio Magik Grace from her home (254-72-1771071).Noon  11. A Quick Lunch  After a stop in Jeevanjee Gardens, Nairobi's equivalent of Speaker's Corner (on a recent Sunday a muscular and aggressive preacher held forth on God's love for street children), head across Moi Avenue for lunch at Topaz, a chicken and chips joint. It's one of the city's favorite greasy spoons, packed even in the middle of the night, and everything here is lovingly deep fried. A meal of chicken, French fries, sausage and a Krest Bitter Lemon soda will run you around 350 shillings.THE BASICSPopular routes from New York to Nairobi are through London on British Airways (www.ba.com) or through Amsterdam on Northwest/KLM (www.klm.com), each less than $1,600 round trip for tickets purchased a month in advance. You can arrange airport pick-up through your hotel, but it's easy, safe and cheaper to grab a cab at the airport. The fare downtown runs around 1,000 Kenyan shillings (about $14, at 71 shillings to the dollar).A Nairobi classic is the Norfolk Hotel, right in downtown on Harry Thuku Road (254-20-216940; www.fairmont.com/norfolkhotel). There are five restaurants, a gym and a pool. Double rooms start at $313, suites at about $500 a night.The Serena Hotel, also downtown, is the other business-class option (254-20-2822000; www.serenahotels.com). It has a pool, a gym, two restaurants and two bars. Rooms are $350 for a single and $420 for a double.In Karen, across from the Giraffe Center, is Giraffe Manor (254-20-891078; www.giraffemanor.com), which used to be a private home, built in 1932, and is now a hotel. A room for two, with full board, is $655 a night. But remember, you're paying for a giraffe to stick its head through the window while you're eating breakfast. Private bookings for dinner and appointments to visit are available. Closed from April 15 through May this year and at Christmas.  36 HOURS JEFFREY GETTLEMAN is the Nairobi bureau chief for The New York Times.</text></article><article id="1833677"><summary>Foraging column on shopping for antiques and carpets at Coin Berbere in Fez, Morocco; photos (M)</summary><text>Arriving in Fez in the early 1600s, the Scottish traveler William Lithgow was astonished to find that Morocco's religious and cultural capital was also a shopper's paradise. ''The city aboundeth in all manner of provision fit for man or beast,'' he observed.If the errant Scot explored the 1,200-year-old city today, he would still find the place full of the artisans' stalls and workshops that have long made Fez the capital of North African craftsmanship. And at Coin Berb&#232;re, he might even unearth the same creations he glimpsed four centuries ago.Owned by brothers Khalid and Mohamed Bouzidi-Idrissi (shown below with Mohamed in the upper photograph and Khalid at right in the lower), the quartet of small clustered stores is where a neo-sultan might furnish his palace, clothe his staff and carpet his floors. One chamber is full of huge 17th- and 18th-century wooden doors. These impressively carved portals now enjoy second lives as wall-mounted artwork. Another nook holds venerable Fez pottery, prized for its distinctive cobalt blue glaze. Earthenware jugs, brass kettles and silver jewelry burst from the corners.Hanging on a wall, an exquisitely sewn 18th-century silk caftan highlights one of the store's specialties: textiles. Even more astonishing is the Star of David stitched deftly into a button. It's a quiet reminder that Jews historically formed a vibrant component of Moroccan society. (Most emigrated to France and Israel in the 20th century.) Upstairs, carpets testify to the artistry of another Moroccan minority, the Berbers, the indigenous inhabitants of North Africa.Like everywhere in the country, prices are unmarked and negotiable. In general, Mohamed says, doors run from 5,000 to 10,000 dirhams ($585 to $1,175, at 8.70 Moroccan dirhams to $1), caftans from 3,000 to 8,000 dirhams, chests from 1,500 to 4,000 dirhams and embroidery from 10,000 to 12,000 dirhams. That will almost certainly include a glass of mint tea.''It's one of the best antique and carpet shops in Fez,'' said David Amster, a 12-year resident who has outfitted his guesthouse, Dar Bennis, with textiles and wooden furniture from the store. ''The owners are friendly, honest and fair,'' he said. ''But of course you have to bargain a bit.''Coin Berb&#232;re is at 67 Talaa Kebira in the Haddadine quarter of the Fez medina (212) 35-63-69-46.SETH SHERWOODFORAGING</text></article><article id="1833678"><summary>Michelle Higgins Practical Traveler column offers suggestions on how to find low-cost airfares to Africa; drawing (M)</summary><text>FOR American travelers, one of the biggest expenses of any trip to Africa, whether a South African safari or a beach holiday in the Seychelles, is simply getting there. During high season most flights cost $2,000 or more round trip -- in coach -- and require stopping or changing planes. And while a few airlines, like Delta and South African Airways, have been adding more convenient routes, fares have continued to rise.''They've typically been going up a little more every year,'' said Jason Hedrick, branch manager at Azumano Travel, an American Express agency in Portland, Ore. ''I have clients who have gone, three years ago, with me to East Africa on a $1,200 or $1,300 fare. Now the least expensive price from the West Coast that I've seen this year is $1,700 or $1,800, and as much as $2,200 or $2,300 during high season.''The average fare in January from Atlanta to Johannesburg was up 32 percent to $1,654 compared with the same month last year, according to Sabre Airline Solutions. From Washington to Johannesburg the average price was $1,879, up 9 percent from January 2006. Overall, the average cost for flights to Africa from the United States in January was up 18 percent.That means that if you're planning an African vacation this year, you may have to be resourceful to find plane tickets that seem affordable. For starters, tally up your frequent flier miles and find out which airlines fly to the region you plan to visit. Then figure out which of them have partnerships with award programs where you have miles. Kenya Airways, for example, will join the SkyTeam alliance later this year -- the airline network that includes Continental, Delta and Northwest.''Just because American doesn't fly to Africa, doesn't mean you can't get there using their miles,'' said Linda Friedman, executive director of Custom Safaris in Bethesda, Md. (British Airways, a OneWorld alliance member that has code-share agreements with American Airlines, flies from New York to London, for example, and from London to 11 cities in Africa.)Ms. Friedman recently helped one of her clients design a trip using United miles for round-trip business-class tickets on Lufthansa from Chicago to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and then separately purchase tickets for flights within Africa. The client flew to Kigali, Rwanda, for a mountain gorilla tour and then, thanks in part to the savings on the business class tickets, which would have cost more than $10,000, she said, spent three nights in Ethiopia seeing the historic cities of Gondar and Lalibela.If you don't have a stockpile of frequent flier miles to burn, consider traveling to Africa in the Northern Hemisphere winter, when flights from the United States to Europe tend to be cheaper than in the busy June-to-August vacation period. ''Since most aircraft going to Africa tend to fly via Europe, our winter months are usually a good bargain,'' said Nina Wennersten, co-owner of Hippo Creek Safaris in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.While many travelers pay a premium to see millions of wildebeest migrate west and north toward the Masai Mara in July and August, tour operators like Ms. Wennersten recommend trips from January to March to catch the herds in the southern Serengeti plains, where they congregate at the Ndutu and Salei plains to give birth.When searching for a deal to Africa, Astrid Breuer, a leisure specialist at Michaels Travel Centre in Agoura Hills, Calif., prices two separate tickets, between the United States and Europe and Europe and Africa. This, she said, lets her find the least expensive overall fare for both parts of the trip. Often the cheaper flight requires a less direct route and a stopover, but that doesn't have to mean longer total travel time.For example, a September trip from Kennedy Airport in New York on Air France, leaving at around 6 p.m. and arriving in the Seychelles around 7:15 a.m. after a 12-hour layover in Paris, was priced at $2,822 earlier this month. By flying the same dates, but on different airlines, Ms. Breuer was able to cut the cost of the trip to $1,502. The cheaper alternative was to take Air India from Newark at about 9 p.m., change in Paris to Qatar Airways and, after a brief layover in Doha, arrive in the Seychelles at 6:45 a.m., for a total trip three and a half hours shorter than the one on Air France.By dealing with multiple airlines on separate tickets, you do run a greater risk of missing connecting flights if there are any delays -- and don't expect the second airline to take responsibility if you do. But sometimes the savings outweigh the risk. ''It's one extra stop,'' Ms. Breuer said of the cheaper flight, ''but if you don't have a lot of money, it's worth doing.''It can also pay to check directly with African national airlines like Ethiopian Airlines, which flies between Dulles Airport near Washington and Addis Ababa, and has flights from there to many other cities in Africa. ''I've found you are generally able to get better deals from the Africa airlines that have international flights to Europe and the U.S., then from the larger American and European Airlines,'' said Amanda Jamieson, an Africa destination specialist at Journeys International in Ann Arbor, Mich. The African Airlines Association offers a list with Web links at www.afraa.org.In April, the Star Alliance began offering an African Airpass that allows a traveler who buys a round-trip ticket to Africa on a member airline like Lufthansa or Swiss Air to take 4 to 10 flights in sub-Saharan Africa on South African Airways, at a savings of about 10 percent.Also, in the last few years, three low-fare carriers -- Kulula, 1time and Mango, the low-cost carrier of South African Airways -- have emerged in South Africa, offering one-way rates as low as 248 rand ($33.50, at 7.6 rand to the dollar) from Johannesburg to Cape Town. Flights from Durban to Johannesburg cost just 219 rand ($29.60) on 1time and 175 rand ($23.60) on Mango.Keep an eye out for new flights to the continent, as airlines sometimes offer low fares on new routes. Introducing its new morning flight from New York to Paris starting May 1, Air France ran a promotion earlier this month touting easier connections from New York to Johannesburg and one-way fares from $535. Last month, Delta announced it would fly nonstop between Atlanta and Lagos, Nigeria, starting Dec. 3. And Virgin Atlantic plans to start daily flights between Heathrow and Nairobi, Kenya, in June.PRACTICAL TRAVELER | GETTING THERECorrection:  March 27, 2007, Tuesday  An article on March 18 about flight delays at John F. Kennedy International Airport caused by a winter storm gave an erroneous name in some copies for an airline whose flight to Zurich was delayed.

Filaq takes advantage of the mood and cajoles the troops into realigning themselves with his cause: to overthrow Buljan and restore the true heir, Filaq's brother Alp, to power.They rode north through cities of carrion and widows, husk-and-stump cities where the Northmen's fires still burned. Everywhere they went, at first, male survivors of the raids fell in with the Brotherhood of the Elephant, as Filaq had dubbed them, not only in token of his own nickname but in bitter tribute to his dead father's fallen banner and the creatures in whose passing lay the seeds of that fall. Some men came on horseback, bearing proper weapons, but most showed up on foot, shoeless, hungry, armed with a pruning hook or a fishing spear or the time-dulled sword of a grandfather's grandfather. Within a week of setting out for Atil, their ranks were swelled -- like a gangrenous leg, as Zelikman remarked -- by two or three thousand beardless fools, dodderers and men crippled by anger, aimless in their aim for revenge. Creaking leather and the snorting of mules, snatches of off-key ballads, the clop of hooves and the patter of bare soles, the rattle of hayforks and lances. In the teeming camps the nailheads of the night itself were loosened, it seemed to Amram, by snoring. They ate what they found, charred wheat in the ashes of granaries, dregs and roots and small birds. Five times a day a terrible wind blew through them and bent them like grasses to the ground.As they moved north, synagogues began to outnumber mosques, and the towns showed no sign of ill treatment by the Rus, who had stopped only long enough to sell, peaceably, the amber, furs, timber and honey they brought with them from the north. This evident discrimination against the Muslims of the southern littoral outraged the Brotherhood, for it was seen as proof of the diabolical arrangement that the usurper, Buljan, had struck with the Northmen. And indeed, Filaq, Jew though he was, found little sympathy for his cause as they drew nearer to the capital, in the heart of Jewish Khazaria, where regard was high for the conduct and merchandise if not the uncouth manners of the Rus. Though there were expressions of regret over the reports of devastation wrought by the Northmen in the south, there was no direct experience of rapine to outweigh the testimony of rich pelts and sweet honey and the finest Baltic amber, and anyway, it was said, everyone knew that southern Khazars were inveterate malcontents and, furthermore, addicted to exaggeration.''In Baghdad during the Days of Awe this year, the Muhammadans burned Jewish prayer houses and put to the sword any who would not profess Islam,'' they were informed by the babaghuq, or mayor, of Sambunin, a Jewish Khazar town only four days' ride from Atil. The babaghuq had ridden out with several city dignitaries wearing fine mustaches, backed by a well-armed if small party of soldiers, to demand the immediate surrender of the mutineers and to offer them, in the event they were unprepared to oblige, a generous emolument of five wagonloads of gold in the hope that the clink of dirhams might encourage the Brotherhood of the Elephant to leave Sambunin unmolested. In closing, the babaghuq quoted a remark widely attributed in the north to Buljan, who claimed in turn to have only been transmitting the wisdom of the kagan, Zachariah, sequestered in his forbidden palace on a sacred island:''If the great Caliph in Baghdad sees fit to permit his Jews to be burned, it would be improper for the kagan of the Khazars not to ensure that his Muslims receive the same treatment.''That night in their camp on a point of land north of the ransomed city, the Brotherhood of the Elephant spitted 500 sheep and feasted on fresh apples with honey and pistachio nuts, a parting gift of the city fathers. Zelikman had eaten little and smoked long, and now he sat staring into a campfire, stealing frequent glances toward Filaq. The Frank's unshaved cheeks sported patchy new wisps, and his golden hair hung filthy and lank.''This is madness,'' he said at last.''I agree,'' Hanukkah said, nodding once, taking a swallow of the sharab the merchants of Sambunin had been kind enough to provide. He fixed his eyes gravely on Zelikman and lowered his voice and said, ''What is?''''It is no madder than any business we have failed at in the past,'' Amram said. ''Maybe less mad. Our numbers are few, if you discount the civilians -- ''''As you must.''''And I do. But the fighting men are of good quality.''''True,'' Hanukkah said. ''That is true, Zelikman. He has a point.''''And they're angry,'' Amram went on, ''but not so blinded by the desire for revenge that they can't see how greatly to their advantage it will be if they can go against the Rus with the entire Khazar Army at their backs under the authority of a new bek. Furthermore -- ''''You have constructed an argument,'' Zelikman observed dryly.''I was inspired to do so,'' Amram said, ''when I observed that you were busy constructing a funk.''''Furthermore.''''Furthermore, I trust your head is not too far inside your dudeen to remark how lightly manned they have left the garrison here. Their strength has been greatly depleted in recent weeks. With the Rus occupied with plundering the southern littoral, Buljan has sent the bulk of his troops into the Crimea to retake it for Khazaria.''''This is supposed to reassure me,'' Zelikman said, ''by suggesting that Atil will be only lightly defended. But all it does is worry me more about the deviousness of this Buljan. These men are being led to the slaughter to satisfy the vanity and lust of a few. I am not a soldier, Amram, and I never was. I'm not like you. I want nothing to do with soldiers and armies and chains of command. All evil in the world derives from the actions of men acting in a mass against other masses of men.''He gathered his cloak around him and stalked off to the edge of the camp, by the tall grass at some distance from the fire, with his face turned toward Francia, a hunch in his narrow shoulders. Every so often he rose and took a few steps and muttered to himself and then sat down again.''He is given to brooding,'' Hanukkah said.''He gives me a pain,'' Amram said.''He misses his home,'' Filaq said. ''Or so he told me.''''He told you that?'' Amram said, surprised. Zelikman was not a man for nostalgia or confession even under the influence of his pipe, and the scant recollections of life in Regensburg that he had offered up over the years fell well short, to say the least, of longing. ''What did he say?''''It's far, the land of the Franks,'' Filaq declared and then nodded sagely, as if impressed by the breadth of his own learning. He held up his hands, palms facing each other and separated by a foot of firelight. ''I have seen it in a book of maps, in the library of -- of a gentleman my father used to take me to visit.''At the mention of his father or the memory of that library with its precious maps, Filaq's soft voice turned raspy with emotion. Amram wondered if a boy holding a book of maps of the world felt as if he possessed the world and if Filaq now felt, remembering, that he had lost it. Filaq watched the brooding scarecrow alone at the edges of the dark, and an unwonted softness entered his strange green eyes. He was a hard boy, orphaned and imperious, but in the days since his momentary failure of nerve Filaq had shown clear signs to Amram of incipient fitness to command. He woke on his own in the dark of morning and retired having ensured that curfew was in force and universally observed. He held himself apart from the men as he had from Zelikman and Amram, sleeping in his own tent, performing his ablutions and elimination in private, riding usually at the head of the train with none beside him and none before, but he fell regularly among the ranks, in the course of a day, all the way back to the weakest and most useless of the stragglers, to join them for a song or find shoes for the unshod. That afternoon he had made over his entire double share of the bribe to be divided among the feeblest and most miserable of the men. He rode well and looked fine on horseback, and he saw to it that those tending the animals were competent and humane. His authority was something bestowed by him on the Brotherhood and not the other way around, and Amram realized that he must himself have fallen to some degree under the spell of the boy's gift for being served by others, because in the light of his pessimism about the expedition there was no other explanation for his presence at Filaq's right hand, unless it was that in some inexplicable but deep-rooted way this pale-skinned, redheaded, foulmouthed young man reminded him of his dark-brown, sloe-eyed lost daughter, Dinah.''What is it like, in Francia?'' Filaq said, without taking his eyes off Zelikman.''Cold and gray and green and rank with fog,'' Amram said. He had never seen Regensburg, but one winter long ago he traveled up the Rhine in the retinue of the ambassador of Constantinople to the emperor of the West, and at times he felt that the chill of that journey was still in his bones. ''The forests are vast and haunted by wolves and bears and men who take the shapes of wolves and bears. The cities of the Christians are mean and mildewed and devoid of splendor. They do not love Jews. Zelikman's family, learned men all, suffered persecution from mobs and princes alike.''''He is a learned man himself,'' Filaq said, ''for a common thief.''''A gentleman of the road,'' Hanukkah said sternly, then winked at Amram and raised a dented tin dipper of wine. ''Are we anything else?''''Indeed we are not,'' Amram said, raising his own battered cup.Filaq stood and nodded to Amram. He signaled a guard and, with a tentative hand on the man's shoulder but no hesitation in his voice, gave the order that the watch should be doubled in case soldiers from the Sambunin garrison or an assassin sent by the babaghuq attempted treachery in the night. Then he walked through the twilight to his solitary tent, picking his way carefully through the horse dung, swinging his gawky camel hips as he went.''A curious lad,'' Amram said.On the way to the tent, the youth was obliged to pass Zelikman. He stopped and stood watching Zelikman watch the light die somewhere over Francia and the West, without speaking. Zelikman seemed unaware of Filaq's presence or of the presence of anyone or anything in the world but the glowing coal of his pipe. From the tall grass beyond his partner, Amram heard a dry rasp like a rough sleeve against leather, and he was already running toward Filaq when he saw an indeterminate shiver in the air, tumbling with the slowness of dice on a mat rolling toward jackpot or ruin. Zelikman sprang up and doffed his hat like a man coming in from a long day in the sun and tossed it as if aiming for a pair of antlers on a wall. Then, as the hat, which had already known such misfortune, gave its life to deflect the flight of yet another knife, Zelikman flung himself after it, onto Filaq, who had heard and seen nothing at all. The youth looked very surprised as Zelikman came down on top of him and slammed him belly first against the ground, his chin striking with a crack. Knife and hat fell to earth like a falcon tangled with the limp bundle of its prey.''Get off me!'' Filaq said. He rolled out from under Zelikman, who looked surprised as if by the turn his bhang dream had taken. Amram kept running toward the bushes, heard thumping behind him and a moment later was overtaken by Hillel, with Filaq mounted bareback and holding Lancet like a pigsticker, charging hard into the shadows on the grass. The horse broke and feinted with deft leaps to the left and right like a ratting dog, and Filaq drove the wicked sword home. There was a cry of pain, and Filaq swung down from the horse. A handful of Arsiyah had followed their Little Elephant into the meadow, on foot and horseback, and now they fanned out looking for stray assassins. Amram ran into Filaq just as he emerged from the high grass, looking shaken, leading Hillel by the halter. He walked past Amram without a look, chest rising and falling, green eyes catching the light of the fires of the Brotherhood, and strode over to Zelikman, who had dusted himself off and was busy cutting his hat to ribbons with the assassin's knife.''I will never again view your affection for this horse as unnatural,'' Filaq said, passing the lead to Zelikman. ''But there is nothing to be said in favor of this blade, which is not even fit for a woman.''Filaq raised Lancet and bridged the gulf between them with its slender span, a compass needle indicating the cardinal point at the center of Zelikman's chest. They stood facing each other, separated by less distance than that which had separated Francia from Khazaria on the maps in that childhood library. There was something between them, some heat of dislike or strangled affection that Amram felt but could not understand, and he wondered if this had something to do, as well, with Zelikman's growing unease. As far as Amram knew, his partner had never lain with a woman or a man, and if he had in hard times, on cold nights, shared a companionable bed with Amram, it was a mark of how much the state of their relations resembled those between his partner and Hillel. Amram had lost much and fared widely alone, but Zelikman was simply born lonely.Filaq wiped the blade on the flap of his tunic and then handed it back, haft first. ''Thank you for saving my life,'' he said.''I don't save lives,'' Zelikman said. ''I just prolong their futility.''When the troopers returned empty-handed from hunting in the grass, Filaq ordered that word be sent to Sambunin.''Tell them their cowardly act has failed,'' he said, ''and that if they do not supply this noble Brotherhood with 500 armed and able-bodied men by tomorrow morning, we will seek to test on their city the techniques we have learned from the Rus.''The tale of the failed assassination attempt was taken up within moments by the Brotherhood, and by the next day embellished word of it had spread all across the marshes. By the time the Brotherhood arrived at the gates of the city of Atil, it numbered nearly 10,000 men, including the 500 grudged by Sambunin and four more detachments of Arsiyah deserters from the Crimean frontier, where it had been reported that a miraculous infant, accompanied by a ghost and a black giant, had raised an army and set out to conquer Khazaria and the world in the name of Allah.The ghost in question was, however, no longer among this semi-legendary crew. He had come to Amram's tent at dawn with a cold twist of a smile on his lips.''If I don't ask you to leave with me,'' he said, ''it's only because I fear you'll turn me down out of sheer perversity.''''Then ask me to stay,'' Amram said.''Stay,'' Zelikman said. ''Fight with strangers. Die on a gate, on a rampart, in a narrow, strange street.''Amram lay back on the rough ground that had kept him awake all night and looked up at the radiance that had begun to light up the stripes of his tent.''I'm tired, friend,'' he said. ''I'm tired of picking up life in bits and fistfuls and little drawstring bags. When you get to be as old as I am, there's an appeal in the idea of seeing some business through from start to finish. Besides,'' he said, ''I don't know why, but I like the kid.''Zelikman nodded, and then they embraced and spoke some plain words in five languages, all of them roughly synonyms for farewell.Next week: Zelikman encounters a caravan from Regensburg, the city of his youth, and a celebrated elephant.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.</text></article><article id="1833683"><summary>Ben Neihart profile of Joe Hill, son of Stephen King and author of his own best-selling horror novel, Heart-Shaped Box; photo (L)</summary><text>Joe Hill is the first guy to admit that it's probably a good thing he took up writing instead of acting. He was just 9 years old when the zombie auteur George Romero cast him in ''Creepshow,'' a 1982 fright flick written by Hill's dad, who also played a dimwit farmer. ''There were all these cool rubber monster parts lying around,'' Hill told me over dinner in December. ''For a little kid, it was a blast. There was my dad, there was some one-on-one time with my dad. But I was terrible. Oh, was I bad.'' The bit about his father he sort of tucked into the conversation as if it were an aside. His dad is a topic he discusses with great reluctance, not because he doesn't love the guy but because when you are as much your father's son as Joe Hill is Stephen King's, once you start talking about your dad, you might never get a chance to talk about anything else.As it happens, Dad dedicated his early novel ''The Shining,'' the semi-autobiographical tale of an alcoholic writer and his sensitive, gifted son, to ''Joe Hill King, who shines on.'' Thirty years later, Hill has chosen to put down roots in the very same literary neighborhood, even though his father, as huge a star as American letters has ever produced, can block the sunshine for an entire state. Of course, there's nothing new about writers, from the literary Amises to the best-selling Higgins Clarks, following in Mom's or Dad's footsteps and letting academics parse the shared strands of literary DNA. But Hill's first novel, ''Heart-Shaped Box,'' the story of a merciless ghost and an aging rock musician, also marks the end of a rather elaborate identity game, the public debut of the man behind a pseudonym adopted more than a decade ago.Published last month, ''Heart-Shaped Box'' received mostly rave reviews. The book is, as they say, an ''instant'' best seller; it is currently perched at No. 10 on the New York Times list. Both Hill's editor at William Morrow and the producer Akiva Goldsman (the Oscar-winning writer of ''A Beautiful Mind'' and ''The Da Vinci Code''), who optioned the novel, insist that they learned of Joe's true identity only after they made their respective deals. But if the timing of the leak seems suspiciously fortuitous, the question of who knew what -- and when -- matters less in the end than why Hill went to the trouble to hide in the first place.In part, the answer lies in Hill's early efforts to reinvent horror as a genre. It was a work no American publisher would buy, a collection of short stories called ''20th Century Ghosts'' (brought out in England in 2005 by PS Publishing, a small specialty house), that first made Hill's reputation. The stories won two Bram Stoker Awards, a World Fantasy Award (other winners that year included Haruki Murakami and George Saunders) and an International Horror Guild Award.Hill writes in two traditions that he would argue are artificially walled off from each other: genre fiction, with its emphasis on breakneck, often outrageous, plot and metaphor; and literary realism, which values detailed characterization, psychological depth and subtle epiphanies. In this, he keeps to the family line. Hill's mother, Tabitha, is an accomplished novelist who straddles the divide between literary and genre. His brother, Owen, published his first collection of short stories in 2004 but is also editing an anthology of superhero fiction; Owen's wife, Kelly Braffet, mixes genre elements -- serial killers, incestuous romance, C.I.A. operatives -- into her fiction. And Stephen King, of course, has long moved freely between what some critics have called lurid potboilers and the quieter work that has won him the respect of the literary establishment. Hill, who spent years trying to write fiction in the spirit of Cormac McCarthy, found his voice only when he returned to the fantasy novels and horror stories -- some fresh from his father's desk -- that he loved as a kid.With his dark, straight hair, full beard and intense eyes, Hill, at 34, bears an unmistakable resemblance to the Stephen King on the paperback cover of ''Danse Macabre,'' published in 1981, when King was the same age. Like his father, Hill married young, has three kids and lives in an isolated part of New England. Also like his father, he shows his manuscripts to his wife. ''A lot of people marry their moms,'' he said. ''I kind of married my dad. I'll go from the manuscript I gave her and the manuscript I gave him and go back and forth, and it's the same comments.'' (Hill's wife, Leanora, and King are so in sync that she reads King's drafts too.)Hill is even more protective of his privacy than his father was for much of his career. (King didn't have Google Maps and other online search devices to contend with.) Though Hill's fallback demeanor is congenital niceness, he wouldn't even consider an interview in his hometown and cut off any questions about his children. Hill is certainly no stranger to aggressive fans. When he was 12, he found a six-pack-toting ex-convict at the front door. ''I just got out of Thomaston Prison,'' Hill remembered the man saying, ''and I just wanted to tell you that your dad's books are the only things that kept me from killing someone in there.'' Here, Hill made a sound effect to suggest that at that moment his head exploded, cartoon-style. ''My memory is that my dad went outside and had a beer with the guy.'' But, he added, ''there have been people who have broken into the house. You get into a little bit of a defensive crouch.''Hill did concede this much: He lives in a remote part of New Hampshire, not Maine, where he grew up. And he works at home. In his office, Hill keeps files full of letters that mark his long literary apprenticeship. Rejection. Rejection. Rejection. He could have had it another way.When he was about 12, The Bangor Daily News accepted an essay he submitted. ''I was completely pumped,'' he told me. ''I felt like I was on the verge of major celebrity, and my excitement about the piece lasted right up until the day it was published. When I read it in the newspaper, I realized for the first time that it was full of trite ideas and windy writing. At the end, they had added a little postscript that said, 'Joseph King is the son of best-selling novelist Stephen King,' and when I read that I knew that was the only reason they published the piece. You know, at that age the fear of humiliation is probably worse than the fear of death, and not long afterward I started to think I should just write under a different name.'' He toyed with several before eventually settling on Joe Hill.Hill found his agent, Mickey Choate, by straightforward query. (Choate was his agent for eight years before Joe told him about Dad.) His early efforts met with little success. ''I got a lot of written personal rejections,'' he said. ''They'd all say, we really like this on a technical level, but I don't think they have an interior life. Those stories didn't excite them, and they didn't excite me, either.''The first full-length work he submitted for publication under his pseudonym was ''an epic fantasy novel.'' But it was a fantasy that didn't conform to established rules of the genre. Hill envisioned it as ''a J.R.R. Tolkien-type novel, but written with the values of a John Irving novel. It wouldn't have a quest or dragons. It would be about family and raising children, but it would be set in a fantasy world.'' When it was turned down everywhere, Hill toyed with the idea of submitting under his real name. He was genuinely pleased with the book and wanted to see it published. ''After that,'' he said, ''maybe there was some feeling like, uh, you know, maybe you should. ... But I actually kind of wound up feeling like the pen name had done its job. If it wasn't good enough to get accepted on its own merits, then that was a healthy thing.''For years after his epic novel was rejected, Hill kept the fantasy genre at arm's length -- until he rediscovered a story that reminded him of the many uses to which fantasy could be put. It was ''The Jewbird,'' by Bernard Malamud, in which a skinny black crow settles in a family's kitchen, cawing, ''Gevalt, a pogrom,'' a comic and ultimately dark treatment of anti-Semitism. The story, which has been called a homage of sorts to ''The Raven,'' by Edgar Allan Poe, undid him. Why, he wondered, should his storytelling be straitjacketed by realism? Hill began writing and selling ''strange'' short stories to small literary and genre magazines, which were later collected in ''20th Century Ghosts.''In one of the standouts in Hill's collection, a jaded editor hunting for a family of ''deranged literary hillbillies'' addresses a conference of horror fans and, expanding an argument Hill first encountered in a Malamud essay, tells the fans that even though most horror fiction was ''creatively bankrupt,'' the best works ''took the most basic elements of literature and pushed them to their extremes.'' It is an apt description not only of Hill's short stories but also of an informal literary movement known as ''slipstream'' -- a combination, as its name suggests, of science fiction, horror, fantasy, mystery and realism. ''The Specialist's Hat,'' by Kelly Link, the genre's critical darling, is a chiller about children, a castle, a hat trimmed with teeth and a baby sitter. ''The Raw Shark Texts,'' the first novel by the British writer Steven Hall, which will be published in the U.S. this month, revolves around ''conceptual'' sharks who track down humans and devour their memories, a horror-dystopic-philosophical mash-up that has critics drawing comparisons to Borges, ''The Matrix'' and ''Jaws.'' In Hill's own allegorical ''Pop Art,'' a boy who happens to be a blow-up doll is persecuted not just by schoolyard bullies but also by his best friend's father.For Hill, making a mash-up of his identity conferred benefits not unlike those that came with the mashing up of genres: ''I liked crime stories, suspense stories, fantasy stories, and I felt like if I wrote as Joseph King I might not want to write genre fiction, but if I wrote as Joe Hill, I could write whatever I wanted. So that's what I did. I had 10 years to write and not have the pressure of being a famous guy's kid.''At the time Joe was born, in 1972, the Kings were a couple of aspiring writers in their mid-20s with little money and a toddler named Naomi. Stephen taught high school and worked at a commercial laundry; Tabitha worked evenings at Dunkin' Donuts. But before Joe's first birthday, his dad sold ''Carrie,'' and the family's financial woes were over. When I asked Hill what it was like growing up in the King household, he quoted an old Jay Leno joke, which went, he said, something like this: Stephen King asks his kids, ''Hey kids, you want to hear a bedtime story?'' And the kids scream, ''Noooooo.''''But it wasn't like that,'' Hill explained. ''My dad is a great storyteller, and we loved to have stuff read to us. As a family, my mom and my dad would sit down and the book would go around the circle -- we'd sit and read all together. It sounds very 19th century, but it's true.''Hill's parents never told him what books he could read or movies he could watch. ''When I was like 11, 12,'' he told me, ''my parents asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, and I said, 'Let's have all my friends over and we'll watch ''Dawn of the Dead.'' ' So we're sitting there watching it. I've seen it like 10 times at this point, and I'm just having a blast and I hardly notice my friends trickling out of the room.'' A couple of boys stayed with him. One boy was ''just lathered in sweat and completely pale.'' Here, Hill put his hands over his face in imitation of a scared little kid, and in a wavering voice said, '' 'I don't think we should be watching this!' ''In the novel King dedicated to his son Joe, the ''shining'' refers to a profound sensitivity to paranormal activity. Even if you remove ghosts from the equation, Joe, according to those who knew him, always had a kind of shining, an openness. Peter Straub, the best-selling novelist who collaborated with King on two books, remembered that King would play ''some kind of imaginative game with the children, but especially with Joe. He'd make up a kind of graph with a matrix on it, and he'd start by saying, 'O.K., George Appleby is driving his Ford pickup truck along this road,' and then he'd say, 'There's something happening over here -- what does he do?' And the kids would say, 'Well, I think he should turn around,' and elaborate on the story.'' Straub nodded approvingly, smiling at the memory. ''If ever I saw mentoring, that was it.'' Among the unpublished works in King's papers at the University of Maine are early artifacts of that mentorship: ''I Hate Mondays,'' a five- page collaboration with Owen King, and ''But Only Darkness Loves Me,'' a two-page fragment written with Joe, of which one page is typed, the other handwritten.The King boys grew up riffing on each other's fantasies; in what they called the Writing Game, a literary version of tag, one brother would write for a few minutes and pass the story to the other. ''We used to play Call of Cthulhu,'' Owen told me, referring to the role-playing game based on the H. P. Lovecraft story. ''Joe was always dungeon master. You had sanity points, and it was like, if you encountered Yog-Sothoth one too many times, you were crazy. You could only have so many adventures, and then you had to have a new character, and I thought that was brilliant.''As grown-ups, the brothers collaborated on a few screenplays after college, but Owen and Joe say they have little influence on each other's fiction. They don't read drafts of works in progress, and except for the rare crossover novel like Michael Chabon's ''Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,'' they don't even read the same books. Owen, Joe told me, set about ''very consciously building a career around not writing genre fiction.'' Joe kept coming back to it.When we first met, Hill, who has the beguiling manner of a kid who has been allowed to skip the classes he hates, the subjects that bore him, was quick to rank some of his genre favorites: ''the best, most frightening short story since Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery' '' (Link's ''Specialist's Hat''); ''the most frightening young-adult novel of all time'' (Neil Gaiman's ''Coraline''); ''the absolute best story about 19th-century dentistry ever written'' (his brother Owen King's ''Frozen Animals''). He sang the praises of Elmore Leonard, Chabon, Malamud and a host of tough-guy ''manfiction'' novelists, to use his affectionately satirical term. The embrace of genre fiction by literary lions like Chabon and Jonathan Lethem means a lot to him.And ''Heart-Shaped Box'' is indeed genre fiction, a mainstream horror novel that Hill himself admits follows closely in the path of work that has come before him. The first third is a haunted-house story as tightly wound as Ira Levin's ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Jude Coyne, a dissipated rock musician, decides to add one more treasure to his collection of Goth memorabilia -- a ghost for sale at an online auction site, who arrives as ordered. Gritty naturalism gives way to a master class in startle effects as the ghost chases Jude through a high-concept version of the Deep South, with supernatural accouterments that are all the more effective for their homeliness: an old man's possessed electrolarynx, a wicked ghost's annunciation on right-wing talk radio, an otherworldly pickup truck no man can outrace. A family of psychics, led by an abusive dowser armed with a hypnotist's razor, propels the story. It's a family you might find in, well, a Stephen King novel.For Joe, being close to his father in his ambitions meant he had a role model and a protector, but it also meant his father's footprints were everywhere -- even, as it turns out, in his adoption of a pseudonym. Early in his career, the prolific King needed another outlet and published four novels as Richard Bachman. When a bookstore clerk outed King, his publisher released a statement saying that Bachman had died from ''cancer of the pseudonym, a rare form of schizonomia,'' and sales of the fifth Bachman book, ''Thinner,'' exploded.When Hill finally sold ''Heart-Shaped Box'' to a major U.S. publisher, he thought he would probably be similarly outed. After the contract was negotiated, Hill called his editor, Jennifer Brehl, and told her his full name and who his father was. Brehl agreed that they would publish the book under his pseudonym and play down the family angle as much as possible. But there wasn't much she could do. ''I had pretty much run to the end of my rope around that time,'' Hill told me. ''I had done an appearance in England, and people kind of noticed a little bit of a family resemblance. There started to be some muttering going around.'' Later Hill told me, a little wistful that the statute of limitations on his pen name had expired, ''It would have been nice if the book could have come out and been out for a while, but it just didn't work out that way.''That ''Heart-Shaped Box'' is more like his father's work than Hill's short stories are may be because Hill can finally suffer the comparison to King. As Straub put it to me, any writer who grows up reading genre fiction needs to corrupt it in some significant way in order to write it himself. ''Back in the 1970s,'' he said, ''I understood that I could do more or less anything I liked with horror because the field was so despised that no one would notice except the fans. Now I see that the genre itself allowed me to do anything that I wanted.'' It took Joe Hill a while to realize the same thing.Ben Neihart is the author, most recently, of ''Rough Amusements.''

Someone who loved the idea of an open-plan living space (itself unusual in these parts) that slides open to the great outdoors and the killer views. Someone whose idea of fun is having a big window in the mezzanine study with a hair-raising view of the traffic on Chautauqua Boulevard that seems to zoom just feet from the house. Someone who said to an architect, ''Let's take a walk on the wild side.'' The term ''spec house'' is the last thing that comes to mind. But that is exactly what this house was. Its architects, Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee, of the firm Johnston Marklee &amp; Associates, initially designed the house for a client who was acting as a rather forward-thinking developer. But when that client had second thoughts and decided to sell the lot before building the house, the architects found financial partners and went ahead with the project themselves. Johnston explains that having designed what she and Lee agreed was the biggest and most suitable house for the very difficult site, ''we felt we had to build it.''And sure enough, the architects' faith in their own design was rewarded. Chan Luu, a jewelry and fashion designer, had been admiring the house for months while it was under construction. And one day when Johnston and Lee were having the house photographed (by Julius Shulman, the legendary photographer of modernist architecture), Luu walked in, and the place was soon hers. ''I really relate to this house,'' she says. ''Everything about it is me.''Given the increasingly stringent requirements for hillside construction in Los Angeles, Johnston and Lee tried to maximize the volume of the house while minimizing its footprint -- a strategy that also let them get away with using only nine concrete caissons to anchor the house to the hill. So they ended up with a three-story structure: the rather cavelike master bedroom is one floor below the main space, and the second bedroom is one floor above, with the study. The house's faceted exterior conceals the considerable amount of structural steel required for the building; otherwise, Lee says, ''it would have looked like a Case Study house on steroids.'' They wanted the house to look as monolithic as possible -- ''almost as a stone on the landscape,'' Johnston says -- so the exterior was coated with a flexible stuccolike material that is generally used for industrial buildings. Collaborating with the artist Jack Pierson, the architects chose a lavender gray that echoed the silvery bark of the eucalyptus trees that flourish here.Inside, the spareness of the interiors is balanced by Luu's sense of whimsy, which led her to buy a fuchsia credenza for the living room and to festoon the light fixture that the architects chose for the dining area with jewelry of her own design. And of course there is the view and the abundant greenery. ''When the doors are open,'' Luu says, ''you are outdoors.''</text></article><article id="1833688"><summary>Rob Walker column on role of design in marketing prepaid phone cards; drawing (M)</summary><text>Prepaid Phone Cards''The main business of manufacture is to make objects that people want to buy,'' Russell Lynes wrote in ''The Tastemakers,'' his 1954 book. ''It is not to improve public taste.'' Thus he was dismissive of the way the term ''good design'' was being used by everyone from the Museum of Modern Art to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. These days, of course, you can't fling a Michael Graves spatula without hitting a panel discussion about the public ''good'' that radiates from adding what Lynes snidely called ''taste appeal'' to workaday objects. But not all objects.Prepaid phone cards -- which sell long-distance minutes in advance for use on any phone -- fall into one of those consumer categories in which the tastefulness of a design isn't much of an issue. To shop for one entails confronting a barrage of blunt, screaming graphic treatments, each jostling for the viewer's eye at the newsstand or convenience store. This echoes the unwieldy nature of the phone-card business: card selections vary significantly not just by region but also by neighborhood, and new cards are released practically every day. It's a ''highly, highly competitive market,'' says Jeffrey Kapner, vice president for marketing for the long-distance carrier Total Call International.A prepaid-card buyer might be a person with no long-distance service or one who finds that prepaid rates to a particular country are a better deal than the packages long-distance carriers offer to residential consumers. Many are immigrants looking for the best deal to call home, so a top mission of the prepaid-card design is to announce in no uncertain terms what country or countries it is meant for. For example, Kapner points to a T.C.I. card meant for Filipinos in the U.S. Its background is a lush, tropical beach scene; a triangle, filled with images of cash, points into a cartoon piggy bank, skipping any subtlety in pitching the card's value. The bright yellow title is ''Tipid Pinoy'' -- tipid means ''thrifty'' and Pinoy is an informal word for ''Filipino.'' Similarly, a card called Vietnam Connect shows post-card-like images from that country; one called ''Mi Paisita'' shows a map of Central America with countries coded by flag design.Five years ago, flags were a dominant form of card-design signaling, says Harvey Caron of Pentagon Graphics, a major printer of prepaid cards. But since then, there has been a move toward cultural images: Jamaica cards might have images of cricket or soccer, a card for calling Israel might show the Wailing Wall and so on. ''Everyone is trying to make their card stand out,'' Caron says -- and if that involves a design that some might consider rather didactic, or even ugly, well, so be it.While simply adding a stainless-steel finish to a commodity like a refrigerator can attract ''good design'' fans, the serious prepaid-phone-card user is rarely bamboozled by taste appeal. These consumers negotiate a minefield of charge structures, confusing activation fees and minute-expiration rules, says Laurette Veres, editorial director of Intele-CardNews, a trade publication. ''When a good card is on the marketplace, people find out very quickly -- 'It's that yellow one with the blue flag' -- and word of mouth travels fast,'' she says. It may travel even faster, she adds, when a card turns out to be a rip-off. Or when it works well for a country that it isn't advertising. Street-level distributors routinely check how a card performs in calls to a variety of markets, looking for hidden bargains, Kapner says, ''almost like bond traders looking for the arbitrage opportunity.''Years ago, when prepaid cards were relatively rare, some featured ''beautiful artwork,'' Veres says, but aggressive designs have long since taken over. Still, at least some card makers have experimented with looks that, if not exactly beautiful, are pretty creative. When Wendy Dembo, a strategic-marketing and trend consultant based in New York, started buying prepaid cards to call a client in Brazil, she was baffled by the ''chaos'' of choices blending in at the newsstand with magazines, lotto tickets, candy and tiny-type charts showing country rates. But since finding one that she likes, she has lately noticed cards with elaborate die-cut shapes: a pair of boxing shorts, an avocado, a woman's backside in short shorts and so on. She was tempted to tell design-savvy friends -- although it turned out that few of them had been paying enough attention to prepaid cards to appreciate the development -- but not to stop using the card she knows works best for her. ''The design is just hideous,'' she says, ''like somebody has gone crazy with Photoshop.'' Even so, she knows it when she sees it.THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-18-07: CONSUMED</text></article><article id="1833693"><summary>William Safire column on question of whether to use 'woman' or 'female' to modify a noun like president (M)</summary><text>''I do not understand why,'' e-mails an irate Beathan Regan of New Hampshire, ''Nancy Pelosi is referred to as the first woman speaker of the House or Hillary Clinton is potentially the first woman president. Is there some inherent power or stigma to female that spawns timidity in the writers of the media?''This column does not fear to rush in where angels fear to tread. Only 27 years ago in this space, when fainthearted sociological euphemists were pushing the gentle grammatical category gender, I stood up for the plain old Anglo-Saxon word sex.I lost that battle. Today, the smooth-sounding gender -- as in gender gap, the political disparity between male and female voters -- has to do with modern social and cultural differences and tensions, while sex is a low-life word disdained as rooted in biological rutting about.Is female doomed to a similar lexical fate at the hands of woman? Put another way, are traditionalists going to lose this one too? Let us first examine the state of play:''Four out of the eight Ivy League schools now have female presidents,'' USA Today reports. ''Clinton is to date the most successful female presidential contender,'' The Boston Globe wrote. Contrariwise, ''Harvard Chooses Woman President,'' The Christian Science Monitor headlined, and The Washington Times reported Clinton as saying, ''To all those who say we'll never elect a woman president, we'll never know unless we try.'' CNN's Larry King, scrupulously fair, had it both ways: ''Having the first woman speaker of the House made us wonder if American is ready for its first female president.''Both words can function as nouns, but female, unlike woman, can also be an adjective. In an Oscar Hammerstein II lyric from ''Flower Drum Song,'' written 50 years ago, a young woman glad to be a girl sings, ''I'm strictly a female female'' -- the first use an adjective; the second, a noun. Adjectives are by their nature stretchable, happily taking ''more'' or ''less'': you can say ''more female,'' but you cannot say ''more woman''; you would have to say ''more womanly.'' In modifying another noun, woman is what the O.E.D. labels an apposite noun -- explaining, even identifying, the noun it ''stands next to'' -- but syntactically stronger than an adjective. Both words can be used as modifiers of nouns, but the noun woman has more weight.There's nothing new about this: The use of woman as a modifier dates to 1300, with the poet John Dryden, translating Juvenal in 1697, noticing ''a woman grammarian who corrects her husband for speaking false Latin.'' Today, usage is neck and neck, with woman as a modifier appearing to my ear as pulling ahead of female by a nose.Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and author of ''You're Wearing THAT? Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation,'' gets that sense, too: ''We're hearing woman as an adjective more often now. Female connotes a biological category. I think many feminists avoid it for the same reason they prefer gender to sex. . . . I avoid female in my own writing because it feels disrespectful, as if I'm treating the people I'm referring to as mammals but not humans.''Now we're getting somewhere: as a modifier, female can be applied to all animals. (My beloved bitch, Geneva, for example, is a female Bernese mountain dog. She would probably take offense if I called her a woman canine, which as a native speaker I would never do.) To develop this female-woman distinction further, turn to Robin Lakoff, professor of linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley and author of a linguistic classic, ''The Language War.''First, Lakoff notes that a ''woman doctor is closer to a 'doctor who is a woman,' while a female doctor is closer to a 'doctor who is female' -- the last an adjective with no indefinite article. A very small distinction in meaning, but I think it works to focus more attention on woman than is focused on female in analogous cases.'' That's because an adjective adds color to a noun, while apposite nouns are part of the basis of meaning of a noun phrase.''The use of either woman or female with terms such as 'president, speaker, doctor, professor,' '' the linguist says, ''suggests that a woman holding that position is marked -- in some way unnatural, and that it is natural for men to hold it (so we never say 'male doctor,' still less 'man doctor'). When I first began in my job, people like me were often referred to as 'woman' or 'female' professors, but thankfully no more, as we have become a more normal (unmarked) part of the academic landscape. In time I trust that women presidents and female speakers will vanish in the same way.''That leads her to make an unexpected point that goes beyond the female-woman divide: ''Since we feel so strongly (still) that a president is necessarily male, every time we say 'woman president,' we reinforce that view: that only a man can be commander in chief, symbolize the U.S. (which is metonymically Uncle Sam and not Aunt Samantha, after all) and make it harder to conceive of, and hence vote for, a woman in that role.''There's a stopper for politicians seeking to curry favor with the distaff decider and female activist long known as the woman voter. But here's a development above politics that is breathtaking in its cultural contradiction: feminists everywhere have begun to turn on the word female.

Cupid has scored a breakthrough hit with ''Cupid Shuffle,'' an addictive little song that made the familiar journey from regional favorite to YouTube staple. It begins, ''They say I'm a rapper, and I say no,'' and you can't argue with that; Cupid croons the lyrics -- very sweetly -- over a brisk and spare beat. He calls out the dance moves, and though the instructions are a bit vague, a few minutes of YouTube research will enlighten curious listeners. He sings ''Now walk it by yourself,'' and dozens of bedroom dancers show you what he means. Atlantic Records signed him, though his major-label debut doesn't have a firm release date. In the meantime Cupid has booked a series of regional appearances. Anyone lucky enough to attend the barbecue festival in Alexandria, La., next Saturday should look for him.Rose KempShe's the daughter of Maddy Prior and Rick Kemp, from the British folk-rock band Steeleye Span. And when she released her debut album, ''Glance,'' in 2003, her label, Park Records, claimed she had ''the instant appeal of Dido.'' Not anymore. Ms. Kemp's new album, ''A Hand Full of Hurricanes'' (One Little Indian), will be released in the United States on Tuesday. It's fierce, swerving from melancholy folk rock into savage guitar noise or disorienting electronics. Ms. Kemp has a lovely voice (it leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste) and an audacious approach: one song, ''Tiny Flower,'' is a miniature round; for 99 seconds the four parts (all sung by Ms. Kemp) overlap in shifting patterns. The whole album is that sharp, whether Ms. Kemp is piling on sounds or stripping them away. ''Violence,'' with a full band, is built around its three squally climaxes. And ''Sister Sleep'' is even more unsettling because it's so quiet: Ms. Kemp sings the whole thing a cappella.Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly''The War on Emo: Whose Side Are You On?'' So asked the British rock magazine NME last year, proving that this much-maligned American genre had finally become impossible to ignore in Britain. And a handful of British acts are finding ways to take America's plaintive (don't call it whiny!) punk tradition and make it their own. Curious American listeners might start with Sam Duckworth, an English singer-songwriter of Asian descent. He records as Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly, and his debut album, ''The Chronicles of a Bohemian Teenager'' (Atlantic UK), was a modest success. One of his best songs, ''I-Spy,'' has a drum-machine beat and a dose of emo self-consciousness: ''I've just begun to realize/That all my favorite songs, regardless of style and structure, are sing-alongs/Why don't you sing along?'' He is to play the Mercury Lounge in New York on Tuesday; other American listeners can visit getcapewearcapefly.com for free songs and videos.The Killers and the Pet Shop BoysSomehow it's a perfect match: those brash upstarts from Las Vegas united with those mischievous dance-music pioneers from Britain. Track down the import single of ''Read My Mind,'' the Killers' latest, and you'll be rewarded with an effective Pet Shop Boys remix, featuring backing vocals from both Boys, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe. Just what this song needed: some crashing synthetic drums and some extended dubby breaks, along with choral buildups that make a grandiose rock ballad even grandioser. Who needs guitars when you've got music machines this precise?Josh Turner and Ralph StanleyMr. Turner's 2006 album, ''Your Man,'' has already generated a pair of No. 1 country hits: the title track and ''Would You Go With Me,'' both handsome love songs that showed off his famous bass voice. With the third single he's trying a different approach: ''Me and God,'' which Mr. Turner wrote, is a duet with the bluegrass pioneer Ralph Stanley. (Three members of the country band Diamond Rio also sing on the track.) It's an effective song because it's so simple. There's no grand epiphany, just a series of simple phrases -- ''Early in the mornin', talkin' it over, me and God/Late at night, talkin' it over, me and God'' -- that evoke the infinite patience of a truly constant companion.  MUSIC: PLAYLIST</text></article><article id="1833720"><summary>Article profiles indie-rapper El-P, who is releasing first new album in nearly five years; life and career reviewed; photo (M)</summary><text>WRITERS and musicians often fixate on certain landscapes at certain times. For Thoreau in the 1840s it was Walden Pond. For Madonna in the 1980s it was her body. For the rapper-producer El-P (birth name Jaime Meline) in the '00s it's post-9/11 New York.''I wanted to capture something I felt was unspoken,'' he said last month, chopping garlic at his apartment cum home studio in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ''There's a shroud that's enveloped this city since 9/11 that everyone is pretending isn't there, and it's affecting me. I'm not trying to make heavy-handed political records. I'm just trying to make sense of this. And make something good to listen to.''An intense, stocky 32-year-old with gray-blue eyes and close-cropped reddish hair, El-P seems consumed with dark thoughts. Making things helps to distract him -- like music or, at this moment, an elaborate lunch of tortellini with sausage and pesto. Another result of this impulse is ''I'll Sleep When You're Dead,'' a CD to be released Tuesday, El-P's first in nearly five years. (He performs Thursday at the Bowery Ballroom.)The CD arrives at a time when the Brooklyn music scene he predates has exploded, making him a veteran both literally and -- in his embrace of funk, noise and electronics -- aesthetically. He commands respect in rock as well as rap circles. TV on the Radio and Cat Power, who both made critically acclaimed records last year, have employed him to remix their material. And coincidentally the return of El-P, who is of Irish-Cajun-Lithuanian descent, comes as the ''white rapper'' is back on the cultural radar, between VH-1's well-received ''Ego Trip's (White) Rapper Show'' and Jason Tanz's newly published ''Other People's Property: A Shadow History of Hip-Hop in White America'' (Bloomsbury USA).''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'' feels simultaneously futuristic, anachronistic and of the moment. Rhymes flash back to Sept. 11, flickering amid surreal scenes of city life witnessed by a strung-out narrator who finds himself awake at 5 a.m., sitting on his stoop smoking a Newport and waiting for the bodegas to open, writing breathless rhymes like:Fell asleep lateNeon buzzPTS stressWe do drugsCity air strangeSticky lungsMayor DoomburgGives no fundsAnd I'm cryin.The futuristic tinge comes from frequent science fiction allusions and especially to the music undergirding the words. Unlike many peers El-P doesn't refashion old soul hits or other familiar songs, although he will sample old records for raw sounds. He adds these to gritty synthesizer tones, distorted voices and machine beats to create data-overload collages. The effect can conjure classic Public Enemy, as if that famed rap group drew inspiration more from Philip K. Dick's future-dystopian fiction than from ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.''''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'' is also a throwback to the indie-underground rap scene of the '90s, when a certain kind of rap held sway for connoisseurs and critics: music often defined by abstract or bookish rhymes, unconventional music and anti-mainstream attitude, as opposed to radio-friendly bragging and dance-floor fodder. And that's entirely appropriate, since El-P helped pioneer the indie-rap movement, first with his revered group Company Flow and later with his record label Definitive Jux -- ''jux'' connoting both artful juxtaposition and, per street slang, artful thievery.He grew up near the Fulton Mall, walking distance from where he lives now. His parents split early on, and he became in his own words ''an unbridled capsule of teenaged rage and delinquency.'' After being kicked out of two high schools in rapid succession (one being St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights), he got an equivalency degree at 16 and finagled his way into the Center for Media Arts in Manhattan, where he studied audio engineering. ''I pretty quickly made the decision that since school wasn't working, music would have to,'' he said.It did, beginning with Company Flow, a rap group consisting of the D.J. Mr. Len, the rapper Bigg Jus and the rapper-producer El-P (a spinoff of his moniker Lyrical Punisher, or LP, which became El Producto, El-P through rap wordplay). The group self-released the ''Funcrusher'' EP in 1995, and before long El-P quit his job in the Tower Records mail-order department ''because, y'know, I was a rap star.''Though clearly speaking with tongue partly in cheek -- by rap-star standards El-P lives, now as then, a modest existence -- the group was a hit among cognescenti for its fiercely anti-almost-everything wordplay and aggressive, near-industrial sound. (The current issue of Vibe magazine calls ''Funcrusher Plus,'' the expanded 1997 version of their EP, ''the defining document of '90s hip-hop dissent.'') And before Eminem was a household name -- and when the embarrassing one-hit wonder Vanilla Ice was still fresh in people's minds -- El-P was singled out as one of the few respected white rappers.''I think he's what a lot of kids struggle to be,'' said Sacha Jenkins, co-creator of the cheeky ''American Idol''-style ''Ego Trip's (White) Rapper Show,'' which has contestants vying for ''ghetto credibility,'' among other things. Mr. Jenkins recalled meeting the 16-year-old El-P at a Manhattan performance space, ''making beats and surrounded by black people.'' And while El-P says that his race is no longer a big issue these days, Mr. Jenkins sees him as the prototype of the white rapper. ''He's not trying to be anything he's not, and I think that's what hip-hop has always been about.''When Company Flow disbanded, El-P went solo and started Definitive Jux, which cultivated a stable of progressive hip-hop acts including Mr. Lif and RJD2. El-P's 2002 debut, ''Fantastic Damage,'' was widely praised, and ''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'' addresses some similar themes: modern-day paranoia, rappers mistaking thuggery for artistry and the corruption of love. It also gathers prominent friends and fans.Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails contributes to the grinding ''Flyentology,'' whose narrator discovers religion on a crashing airplane. And members of the prog-rock group Mars Volta add frenetic guitars and vocals to ''Tasmanian Pain Coaster,'' about meeting a troubled, bloodied friend on the A train. El-P said the character represents both himself and his traumatized hometown: ''I feel like New York needs therapy, man. And I'm one of the people.''By modern hip-hop standards his rhymes are remarkably self-analytical. The CD's finale, ''Poisenville Kids No Wins,'' relates a struggle with what sounds like a fearsome drug problem, while Chan Marshall -- who performs as Cat Power and suffered a publicized struggle with alcohol abuse last year -- sings the redemptive coda. Is the character autobiographical? ''It's an amalgamation of me and other things,'' El-P said. He declined to be more specific but said he had indulged in ''self-destructive'' behavior.Marketing his record may also be a fight. Independents like Definitive Jux are feeling the same crunch as media conglomerates amid illegal downloading and falling sales. And their aesthetic, underdog by definition, seems to have lost some cultural traction lately, as critics and taste-making bloggers appear more dazzled by drug-dealing, true-crime narratives of major label acts like Clipse and Ghostface Killah. Even El-P has moderated his anti-mainstream stance. ''Just because I run an indie label doesn't mean I don't think Jay-Z is nice,'' he said.But he remains optimistic. His label's Web site, definitivejux.net, offers its own downloads, and he says their ''secret weapon'' is, simply enough, quality.''I strongly believe in the art form of the album,'' he said, contrasting the concept with the current hegemony of the hit-singles-plus-filler formula that rules commercial hip-hop. ''If you have your artists in the right mind-state, it's possible they'll make important records, beautiful records, records in the classic sense of what they meant when we fell in love with music as kids.''MUSIC</text></article><article id="1833723"><summary>Shoshana Romer letter disputes February 25 travel article reviewing restaurants in Boulder, Colo</summary><text>To the Editor: I thought that ''Boulder, Colo.: Fine Dining With a Hippie Past'' (Surfacing, Feb. 25) was misinformed and misleading.

Devote yourself instead to the things that will be remembered: the table, the ambience and the food.Draw up a chronological list of what should be done ahead of time, like the bar and the table, of when initial preparations for each dish should begin, when they should go on and off the stove, etc. This prevents confusion and forgetting something important.

The main course should begin with fresh empty plates served at the table or from a buffet so people can have exactly what they want.Finish is as important to a dinner party as it is to a wine.

Mr. Campbell, who runs the front of the house, welcomed us on our first visit with a friendly, ''Hi, I'm Scotty Campbell.'' Mr. Peragine, the chef, holds up his side of the partnership with creative American food, influenced by cuisines from around the world, which ranged from pleasing to terrific with only one or two missteps.PeraBell has a publike ambience; the big, noisy bar is the larger of the two rooms, with four flat-screen TV sets, a large blackboard listing specials available only in the bar, walls of painted pressed tin, patrons lined up at the long bar and more seated at the inviting high tables. In contrast, the small dining room behind the bar is sedate, almost stark and a bit cramped. It has bare wood tables and floors, votive candles on the tables, wall sconces holding flickering candles, a blackboard of specials and friendly staff members who warm up the room.Two Asian-inspired appetizers led the parade of hits. We loved the tender Thai glazed short ribs accompanied by multicolored crispy noodles. Equally compelling was the mix of ahi tuna and mango tartare in a soy-sesame dressing, encircled with a ribbon of cucumber and crowned with a mound of spicy seaweed salad. Wonton chips completed the presentation.Another Asian favorite, lettuce wraps, fell short. The filling of diced chicken and assorted vegetables in a hoisin-dominated sauce was tasty, but the lettuce leaves (Boston, in this case) shared the plate with the hot mixture and immediately became warm and soggy. The joy of this dish is the contrast of temperatures and textures.One offering that got those contrasts right was the chicken Cobb salad with chunks of hot-from-the-grill meat complementing the crunchy cold ingredients.Two other salads also made a good showing: a far-above-average Caesar with shaved Parmesan and large, house-made croutons; and a delightful chopped iceberg creation with crumbled bacon, blue cheese and tomato in a red wine vinaigrette, all topped with crunchy onion rings.The only strikeout among the first courses was the baked clam casserole, a bready dish with nubbins of chewy seafood.Listed among the appetizers are three child-friendly favorites: chicken fingers; baked mac and cheese with bacon and chives; and a pair of miniburgers on brioche rolls -- called ''pop burgers'' on the menu, because you pop them in your mouth; they are served with shoestring potatoes. All would make reasonably priced entrees for children ($7 to $9).We didn't try those miniburgers, but the regular 10-ounce version, offered with a variety of toppings and a mountain of fries ($9), was a juicy sensation.The only entree that failed to receive high marks was the half chicken, billed as crispy. It wasn't (though it was tasty and moist); it was covered with a vegetable-dotted sauce, which turned the skin soft.The top three meat choices were a cooked-to-order New York strip steak with herbed French fries; succulent braised short ribs with blue-cheese mashed potatoes; and a special veal chop topped with abundant crab meat and a creamy chive sauce. The best fish sampled was the flaky, potato-and-horseradish-crusted salmon set over saut&#233;ed spinach and a tangy mustard sauce. Shrimp New Orleans also made points with its toss of fettuccine, green onions, tomato and saut&#233;ed shrimp in a spicy garlic-tomato broth.There was no letdown at dessert time. One night a special called Mrs. Campbell's homemade cheesecake -- in honor of Mr. Campbell's mother -- was the king of the sweets, with a ganachelike chocolate mousse topper. The warm apple crisp &#224; la mode and the walnut-brownie sundae with chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce and sprinkles were other pleasers. All would have been even better had they been topped with freshly whipped cream, not the stuff from an aerosol can.PeraBell Food Bar114 West Main Street  Patchogue  (631) 447-7766VERY GOODTHE SPACE -- Large, spacious bar; small, cramped dining room.

You may have tree roots that have grown into your sewer lines, which is a typical problem, believe it or not. In a kitchen, the likely culprit is grease that has built up to the point where normal cleaning won't fix it.DISALVO: In an older building you may simply have pipes that are rusting on the interior, and the rust has built up to the point that it is reducing the aperture of the pipes. I'm afraid if that's your problem, the only thing you can do is replace those pipes with modern cast-iron or PVC piping. Properly installed, they should be good for at least 30 years.HOLBROOK: It could be that the pipe from the toilet to the sewer isn't sufficiently angled to clear the waste in it. All pipes from toilets are pitched, to let the water run down them, but 30 years ago, in the era of the big five-gallon-flush toilets, the angle didn't have to be so severe. The water went crashing down the drain, no problem. Now, with water-conserving toilets, you may not have enough force to send the water down.My contractor insists on straightening my uneven walls and ceilings. Why should I spend money on this?FANUKA: You need to know yourself. If you are a person who is picky, you are going to look at the room and see that it isn't perfect, and it is going to drive you crazy. Even people who aren't finicky are going to see that walls and ceilings aren't square when there are moldings, tiles or wallpaper. At the edge of the wall you'll see the angle where the wallpaper pattern has been cut off, or the tiles will get smaller and smaller along the floor. Holbrook: If you are doing a renovation that involves new moldings, tiles or built-in furniture, you'll actually save money by getting the walls and ceilings right. It's more difficult to work on a surface that isn't level and squared. The contractor will have to spend a lot of extra time trying to make the whole thing look O.K., and when he spends time, you spend money. Dardick: It isn't just a matter of making the house look right. If you have crooked walls, you will have a hard time installing doors correctly. You'll have doors that don't close properly or swing open all the time.What are the best kinds of paint for the exterior of my house?LICHT: There are two basic kinds, oil-based and water-based, which is generally called latex. The best kind of paint for exteriors is oil paint, but for environmental reasons, in New York State you can use it only on trim. There are latex alternatives, but frankly I don't love them.SLOVAK: The right choice of color can transform your house and add value, but that's an aesthetic decision. Whatever color you choose, you should make sure you are using the right sheen for the different parts of the exterior. Flat sheen works best on vinyl and aluminum siding; it hides imperfections and is easy to touch up. Satin, which is sometimes called eggshell, does the best job adhering to wood siding. Semigloss is durable and easy to clean and works best on trim work and the casings around windows. High gloss is the most durable and does best for high-use areas.TESCHKY: In the end, the most durable sheen is high gloss, and I use it all over the house if I can.DISALVO: In the old days they didn't use high-gloss paint, so for historical homes you should use flat paint.How do I choose a range hood to work with my cook top?LICHT: Each stove is rated by the amount of heat it generates. A standard household stove will work with most range hoods, but if you buy one of the professional stoves like a Viking, Garland or Wolf, you will need a larger hood with a more powerful blower. There are also self-circulating hoods that aren't ducted out of the house. These are really for people in apartment buildings who can't punch holes in their walls. People in New York City use these for big, commercial ovens, but they shouldn't. Paster: For an electric stove, you don't really need a ducted system. A self-circulating hood will work just fine. Gas stoves should have a ducted system, and if they have a grill or griddle, they will need a powerful one.FANUKA: Don't forget the duct work you are using. The standard duct diameter is 6 inches, but if you have a commercial stove, you'll want to use an 8- to 10-inch duct.I want to hang my flat-screen TV on the wall. What do I need to know?SLOVAK: Some people want their TV flush against the wall. Others like it on an articulating arm. Either way, the television is attached to the wall using a bracket that needs to be anchored to something solid like a wood beam or some other structural support. Otherwise, you'll need to open the wall and build a supporting frame.DISALVO: The tricky part is what you do with the wires. If you are doing a major renovation, you'll have open walls and can run the wires easily. If not, you may have to do some pretty extensive damage.DARDICK: Think about where you are putting your television with respect to your windows. Otherwise you'll be watching the game through tremendous glare, and that's not fun.The PanelJERRY DARDICK  J.M.D. BUILDERS  ChicagoVINCENT DiSALVO  DiSALVO CONTRACTING  BrooklynSTEPHEN FANUKA  FANUKA INTERIORS  QueensMICHAEL GROSSWENDT  ALL COAST CONSTRUCTION  Los AngelesGERRY HOLBROOK  TACONIC BUILDERS  ManhattanJOY LICHT  CAYLEY BARRETT  Mount Vernon, N.Y.BILL PASTER  WILLIAM PASTER  ManhattanJOHN TESCHKY  JOHN P.

''Every year we go ice climbing, and I set up the wall to practice here at home. I happen to have two huge trees that are eight feet apart. I put eight-inch lag bolts through eight-foot-long, four-by-four posts, spaced out every 32 inches. Then I drape fencing over both sides and cover it in cloth. Then comes the water. It runs continuously for two weeks straight. It's about 12,000 gallons of frozen water. All told, about $60 worth of water. Climbers come from all around the state to practice.

MOST WANTED</text></article><article id="1833790"><summary>Stephanie Lyness reviews Skappo restaurant in New Haven, Conn; photos (M)</summary><text>SOMETIMES she'll drop by your table during the meal. An attractive woman of medium height, she has short, dark hair and bold eyes and wears a long, clean red apron. She stands at her ease, a hand resting on your dinner partner's shoulder, and asks, ''Have you been to Umbria?'' Pretty soon you're chatting. She becomes animated, and it strikes you that this fairly ordinary woman has begun to glow -- suddenly she's Sophia Loren.The lady is Anna Gambacorta, chef, wife, and mother of Skappo, a tiny wine bar in New Haven's Ninth Square district. You can read about how she met her American husband when he was traveling in her hometown of Assisi, in Umbria; the story is on the restaurant's Web site. Now they have three adult children, two of whom have introduced themselves while waiting on tables. The daughter is a beauty herself. She makes the desserts (with the exception of an exquisite torrone), and when she announces her specials, she does so with pride.The food and its presentation are unabashedly simple. It looks and tastes as if made at home, not in a restaurant. It is very much food cooked by a woman concerned primarily with soul and substance rather than appearance.The menu is a sequence of four movements: crostini, appetizers, vegetables and entrees. Each item is followed by a suggestion from the large though not unwieldy list of Italian wines. Entrees are larger than tapas size but not quite substantial enough for a full meal. This encourages us to order several plates and to try several wines, which is, of course, the point.For appetizers one night we decided on the piatto misto, an antipasto of cured meats and cheeses; the salad of the day, with oranges and black olives; and veal liver crostini. The misto arrived just as one might serve it at home, a plate of cured meats with hunks of cheese (neither expertly sliced), bread and tomatoes identified by our waitress as ''half-dried'' and imported. The meats and the aged provolone were excellent, and the tomatoes, dried just enough to concentrate their flavor, were remarkably good. (Skappo sells a large can for $15.95; they're not cheap, but you may never use a winter tomato again.)The salad, with a light, well-balanced balsamic dressing, was marred only by unremarkable olives. On a later visit, the salad had the same dressing but was garnished with dried apricots, and I liked it better. The veal liver crostini were mild and pleasant. Wine suggestions were on the money.I followed with two vegetable dishes (perhaps Skappo's forte): butternut squash with walnuts, and a plate of roasted vegetables mixed with chickpeas, farro and lentils -- unusual, and good. I preferred both to my companion's rather basic lamb stew.On other visits, we were able to sample most of the small menu. Falafel-like chickpea fritters, made with ground, fresh chickpeas and spinach and topped with a thick spinach sauce, were superb, as were corn pancakes served on top of simply stewed lentils. Broccoli gnocchi were beautifully soft but tasted of uncooked flour. Pastas have been perfectly acceptable but I wouldn't leave home for them. An entree timballo (a homey, layered affair) of potatoes and zucchini, however, was delicious, particularly the basil-infused tomato sauce.Chicken with a red pepper sauce was remarkably tender, but my favorite meat was a piece of braised beef, stuffed with salami and red pepper.For dessert, warm chocolate mousse tasted like hot chocolate that was thick enough to eat with a spoon, in contrast to the sweet orange mousse, which was airy and refreshing; an appealing regional cornmeal torte was a little heavy. The torrone, made by a cousin in Umbria, is not to be missed.A meal at Skappo is a sojourn into the Umbrian countryside. The food is not as inexpensive as one might think, because the plates are small, but a meal here is very good, and the wines are better than reliable. And it's certainly cheaper than airfare.Skappo59 Crown Street  New Haven  (03) 773-1394  www.skappo.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE -- Comfortable, narrow room with exposed brick walls hung with banners and windows onto Crown Street.

With the opening of Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in Fairfield last year, the discussion has taken on a fresh dimension, focusing on whether the pizzas served at this new location measure up to those made at the original Pepe's.To the average aficionado of thin-crust pies, the chewy, somewhat salty dough dished up by Fairfield's Frank Pepe is every bit as good as any coming out of New Haven. One reason for that is the use of a coal-fired oven, which generates far more heat than most gas or electric installations. Another, a waitress told me, is that the batter (and red sauce) is whipped up every day from scratch.As at its parent restaurant, the signature dish at Frank Pepe's is the white clam pizza ($18 for a very large medium), which is dressed with large chunks of fresh clams, olive oil, oregano, garlic and a dash of grated cheese. Another popular item is the bacon pie ($12.25 for a medium). Additional toppings include mushrooms, onions, garlic, peppers, pepperoni and sausage, as well as salami ($2.25 extra per medium pizza), shrimp ($10) and chicken ($5.40). Pepe's also offers small green salads for $3.50.The two-room, 102-seat restaurant is similar to the New Haven site, with booths in the same dark green vinyl, tables of a similarly light, wood-grained formica, and walls decorated with abbreviated menus and vintage photographs of you-know-who. Unlike its Elm City progenitor, however, most nights at Fairfield's Frank Pepe's you won't have to wait in line to get in.Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, 238 Commerce Drive, Fairfield; (203) 333-7373 or www.pepespizzeria.com.

Except, of course, when what's bigger is the person actually having the steak, the cola or the cappuccino.This is the cultural contradiction animating Luis Alfaro's ''Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,'' a fantasy riff about hunger that runs through April 1 at the Hartford Stage. Judging from his photograph, Mr. Alfaro is a big guy, and he has said that the play was inspired by his own struggles with his weight. As a large person myself, I have to hope that he is less confused than his play.''Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner'' centers on a food-obsessed woman named Minerva, but it's not about eating disorders or prejudice or self-hatred. Nor is it about fat pride or genetics or even dieting. It's billed as a comedy, and obesity is the occasion for the play, not its subject. Like its heroine, ''Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner'' is overstuffed and not sure where it wants to go. There is lots of room for free association, which is fine for Mr. Alfaro, but not so fine for the rest of us.Everyone in the play is starved for something, beginning with Minerva, who lives somewhere in the American suburbs with her genial lout of a husband, Al, and two standard-issue children whom we never meet. Like many of her peers, Minerva cooks and cleans and watches Oprah. But unlike most of them, she is quite literally ballooning. Elisa Bocanegra dons increasingly outsized pink-and-white fat suits as Minerva begins more and more to resemble an upended blimp. When, at the end of Act I, she suddenly levitates, it's less of a surprise than it should be. She's never seemed quite real, and at last we understand that she has been rushing toward metaphor from the get-go.But metaphor for what? Minerva's meditations on her weight are conveyed in the letters she writes to Mee Chee, a Buddhaesque buddy she met at a fat farm. These missives are no more enlightening about why Minerva is suddenly lighter than air than they are about why she keeps plying Mee Chee with gifts of food.As Minerva ascends vertically, her sister, Alice, becomes increasingly horizontal. Minerva has succumbed to America's bounty of food, Alice to its superabundance of sex. She can't count the number of men she has had and won't tell how many husbands; but when a good-looking cop pulls her over, she tells her sister, it doesn't take long before he's naked in her bed and she's head over heels.Played by Yetta Gottesman, Alice has a blankly awestruck response to everything she encounters. In the case of Officer Fernandez, played by James Martinez, this is not unwarranted. Despite his apparently overwhelming craving for Alice's body and his evident knowledge of sports -- the sports talk between the officer and Al provides some of the play's few genuine laughs -- police work is the only thing Fernandez truly cares about. This makes him not just an exceedingly odd duck but also a most unfortunate choice for true romance, which is the kind Alice has finally decided she wants.Al, meanwhile, repeatedly lists for the incredulous Alice all the everyday things Minerva can no longer do because of her expanding girth: shop for clothes at the mall, buckle her seat belt, sit in a booth at Denny's. Eventually, he has to relinquish his accustomed place in front of a TV set permanently tuned to ESPN to do the household chores while his wife floats serenely above him, thinking.While these characters seem like they could go somewhere dramatically, Mr. Alfaro never offers them a road map. Minerva says she wants to be skinny, but it's clear that she wants to be fat. Al, played by Felix Solis, seems to care deeply about his wife, and he hasn't lost his hankering for her. Yet at times he's downright insulting, forcing her to try to touch her toes, or taunting her with the word ''blubber.'' And although for the most part their marriage appears to be rock-solid, suddenly they're in a scene in which they struggle to force out the words ''I love you.''Love, as usual, seems to be the crux of the matter. Late in the play, we learn that Minerva and Alice were left to fend for themselves at an early age, abandoned by parents they never saw again. Perhaps, then, Minerva's addiction to food and Alice's addiction to sex are attempts to find substitutes for the love denied them as children? Or has Minerva begun floating (courtesy of ZFX Flying and the director Lisa Peterson) to withdraw from her family, the way her parents withdrew from her?Mr. Alfaro has left loose ends all over the place, along with those raging appetites.''Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,'' by Luis Alfaro, is at the Hartford Stage, 50 Church Street, through April 1.

Once there, the d&#233;cor didn't make things much clearer. Murals of majestic mountains evoke J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, as do the slate wall tiles, stonelike table tops and sly ring shapes created by much of the food presentation.But this Pleasantville restaurant has a serious seasonal menu that -- despite welcoming children with half portions -- has grown-up aspirations, specifically those of the chefs, Dan Petrilli (who is also the owner) and George Flay. In a phone interview, Mr. Flay said he and Mr. Petrilli were simply using Tolkien's character Frodo as an inspiration and there was no direct link to the restaurant's food or mission. Frodo, he said, ''had a great load to bear, and restaurants can be like that -- you have to be passionate.''The first time I ate at Frodo's, the food was as confusing as the restaurant's look. The house-made butter and warm rolls were delicious, but the fillings in the pork wontons, an appetizer, could barely register beyond the oversweet root beer barbecue sauce. The pan-seared sea scallops, an entree, were a perfect balance of caramelized sweetness and fresh, surprisingly earthy bites of the sea; but the steamed mussels in Frangelico shallot broth, another appetizer, were tough and, worse, tasted slightly past prime. Most off-putting of all were the sliced strawberries accompanying the delicious desserts: They tasted as if they had been cut by a knife -- or on a surface -- that had just been used for garlic.Other meals were far more successful, among the best I've had in recent months. An appetizer special of braised beef, caramelized onion and Gorgonzola ravioli in an apple cider reduction was a wonderful late winter treat, the thin pasta a perfect foil for the hearty, satisfying filling. Frodo's version of braised short ribs, so tender they fell off the bone, mixed wonderfully with the beet-whipped potatoes and winter vegetable ragout. And a special of pan-roasted wild striped bass hinted of spring, with blood oranges bringing out the sweet richness of the butter sauce.Salads are especially well done, spanning a nice range of flavors. A shaved fennel and golden delicious apple version with toasted walnut and Gorgonzola in apple cider vinaigrette is my pick for a light, fresh taste. The roasted baby beets with crispy goat cheese wontons and truffled blood-orange vinaigrette is rich and warming.Frodo's has a real weakness for sweetness: Nearly everything on the menu has a sweet aspect, and it can be overwhelming. But one area where this works well is, of course, dessert. I like everything Frodo's offers, but the brownie and the cranberry, raisin and chestnut bread pudding were particularly well done. A cannoli filled with chocolate cream and served in a blood-orange sauce, a special, was another especially strong effort.Blood oranges, you may have gathered by now, were a recent leitmotif, appearing throughout the menu. Earlier visits found edamame and sweet peas used in similar ways. Mr. Flay and Mr. Petrilli are certainly creative, and their enthusiasm is also appreciated. The background music is eclectic, including the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin on recent visits, and one gets the feeling that the staff is having some fun and hoping you do too. The service is generally excellent -- attentive and helpful. When it all comes together with a great taste, the result is magic indeed.Frodo's472 Bedford Road  Pleasantville  (914) 747-4646  www.frodosrestaurant.comGOODTHE SPACE -- Soft lighting, a sweet little bar and mountain murals combine with slate tile and stone-colored tables for a slightly incongruous but intriguing look.

In addition to calves and tractors, there is wonderful food-to-go at the tiny Blue Hill Caf&#233;, like a high-gloss chocolate tart, which on a recent March morning Philippe Gouze, the cafe manager, confessed to having had for breakfast.The cafe is part and parcel of the philosophy that drives the show that is Blue Hill at Stone Barns: ''Know thy farmer.'' The folks at Blue Hill are not purists, but the pork, tender greens and fresh eggs are all homegrown. Takeout trays and plates are made from recycled pressed paper; spoons and forks are derived from corn, sugar cane and potatoes. Visitors can eat at outdoor tables or duck inside the hay barn in inclement weather.For early risers and hikers, breakfast items include granola, oatmeal and sugar-dusted scones. For lunch -- which came first, the chicken salad or the egg salad? Both are fine interpretations of the classics.Other notable offerings from a changing roster: panini of rich Pennsylvania Noble cheddar and arugula pesto, or of roast pork, golden raisin chutney and pickled fennel; celery root salad dappled with mustard seed; homey white-bean soup; fat latkes with parsleyed applesauce; apple crumble; plum custard; and big, golden oatmeal cookies. Excellent cappuccinos, lattes and hot chocolate are made to order by the friendly staff; yogurt drinks from Ronnybrook Farm Dairy and natural sodas are also available.Sandwiches are $7.50; salads, $12.25 per pound; soup, $4.85; pastries, $2.15; and cookies, 80 cents.Blue Hill Caf&#233;, 630 Bedford Road, Pocantico Hills, (914) 366-9600, www.bluehillfarm.com.

Most of the food on the extensive menu is familiar Filipino fare, which has Chinese, Spanish and Malay influences.The lumpia sariwa, a vegetable spring roll served with a peanut butter and garlic sauce, is a good starter. For a light lunch, try the pancit bihon, translucent rice noodles mixed with scallions, carrots and cabbage. The ginataang sitaw at kalabasa, or saut&#233;ed string beans and squash in coconut milk, is a tangy accompaniment. The batchoy, a classic soup with pork and noodles, is a meal in itself.But the best bet is to order a combination meal, which consists of rice or pancit along with two side dishes (options change daily but include meat, seafood and vegetable choices). The chicken apritada with potatoes, peppers and carrots is a straightforward choice, whereas the lechon kawali, crispy deep-fried pork belly served with a liver sauce, is for the more adventurous eater. The sweet-and-sour tilapia puts a fresh spin on a common sauce. Prices are inexpensive; the combination meal, for example, costs $3.95.Ponciano Aguirre and Fely Empestan opened the first Fiesta Grill in 1998 on Newark Avenue, with 18 tables. A second and much larger Fiesta Grill opened in 2005 on West Side Avenue, across town; there is a banquet hall for 200 with a dance floor.

Ceilings had collapsed on each of its three floors. The basement held half a foot of fetid standing water. The electricity and plumbing had long since quit. Appallingly, there were still tenants; one of them had rigged a garden hose to get running water from next door.Mr. Scalera, who is also public affairs director for Verizon New Jersey, must have been feeling optimistic, because he bought the building. Later he joined two partners -- David Anstatt, a builder, and Jose Rodriguez, a real estate developer -- and now they own a good part of the block. It is becoming a Newark metaphor of another kind, an emblem of hope, and 27 Mix, the restaurant on the ground floor of No. 27 (the top two floors are still residential), is its centerpiece. The restaurant opened in July 2005, and like downtown Newark it has a way to go. The kitchen is sometimes uneasy with the middle-of-the-road New American menu, and the sweet, earnest service can become sclerotic when things get busy. But even that is a sign of how far things have come since Mr. Scalera, now 56, arrived: back then, ''busy'' was an alien concept in this part of town.The block can still seem depopulated at night. But the three partners -- Italian-American, German-American and Cuban-American, hence ''Mix'' -- have done a splendid job of resurrecting their old ruin.Its graceful brick facade, sandblasted to look as it must have when the building was new in 1860, gives off a ruddy glow of health. The tall front door and windows, all made of cedar and inlaid zinc and glass, have an inviting SoHo feel, and that theme continues in the long, narrow interior, designed by Madeline Ruiz. The bar is made of polished blond-wood beams salvaged from an adjoining building, an open kitchen dominates the middle third of the space and local art hangs on a room-length exposed-brick inner wall.The chef is C. J. Reycraft Jr., a 25-year-old graduate of the French Culinary Institute in Lower Manhattan. He has a way with colors and textures, what you might call plate feel. While appetizers here are basically bar food, some stand up to close inspection -- particularly a hearty, delicious sweet-corn polenta, which consists of two firm yellow triangles of cornmeal batter, grilled to a fine smokiness and topped with saut&#233;ed wild mushrooms, mascarpone-garlic cream and balsamic vinegar.Fried calamari were crunchy and relatively grease free, spiffed up by wasabi mayonnaise and by an abundance of arugula in a garlic-ginger vinaigrette. The whole production spilled out of a Chinese-takeout container, a touch that brought double-takes and grins all around. Tomato soup had a full texture and a lovely roasted flavor.Main courses held a couple of serious disappointments. A plate-filling fillet of red snapper was charred to the point of creosote, and a thick pork chop was brined to an oddly springy texture and an almost inedible saltiness. An even more generous serving of blackened New York strip steak, with a vivid spicy exterior, would have been terrific if it had been cooked rare, as ordered. It came to the table raw and purple inside, like very tough sushi. Duck &#224; l'orange was properly cooked, however, and so were two standard but satisfying fish entrees: seared salmon with a creamy crab sauce and more of that polenta, and grilled rare tuna with garlic mashed potatoes and julienne vegetables in a sweet sake vinaigrette.The best dessert is gelato, in creamy scoops of hazelnut and chocolate, from the supplier Pasta Shop. That and a glass of dessert wine will make the after-dinner hour pass too quickly. In warmer weather, you will want to spend it in the rear garden, an airy space in the shadow of what may be New Jersey's most underappreciated landmark, the soaring Gothic spire of St. Patrick's Pro-Cathedral on Washington Street.Nights in the gardens of downtown Newark.

Reviewed March 18, 2007DINING/NEWARK</text></article><article id="1833848"><summary>Living In article on Park Hill section of Yonkers, NY; maps; photo (M)</summary><text>COMING upon Park Hill, a stately 19th-century neighborhood of mansions and bungalows on a 300-foot-high wooded plateau overlooking the Hudson River, is like discovering a never-never land.It is perched, almost symbolically, above the poverty-ridden southwest section of Yonkers, New York's fourth-largest city, with just under 200,000 residents, on cliffs that afford a far different, more bucolic view of the surrounding countryside.Developed in 1888 by the American Real Estate Company of Manhattan, it was one of the first planned suburban communities in the area, and its Victorians, Gothic Revivals and Georgian colonials were advertised to attract city-weary New Yorkers.Since that time -- notably in the years after World War II -- more modest Cape Cods and ranches have sprung up among the grander of Park Hill's 1,200 or so properties. Nowadays, there is even some new construction, on lots relatively free of the large old trees that define the rest of the neighborhood.The old-new divide is reflected in residents' attitudes toward preservation. According to petitions circulated several years ago, about half see a need to regulate renovations and new construction through the use of municipal landmark designations. They argue, among other things, that this would help maintain higher property values.But there were enough opponents to this approach four years ago to defeat a preservation proposal. Although debate then was sometimes rancorous, said Shelley Weintraub, president of the Park Hill Residents' Association, which represents about 400 families, ''we're going to give it a second shot.''Ms. Weintraub has lived for the last eight years in a four-bedroom Arts-and-Crafts-style bungalow with her husband, Lee, who sat on the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission under Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. She said the group in favor of landmark status had hired a historian to prepare a new application and would reintroduce the proposal after trying to ''educate'' the opposing faction about preservation.But judging from the stance of one opponent, Rosemary J. Uzzo, that process may prove challenging. Ms. Uzzo, a former director of public information for the Yonkers schools who has lived in her English Normandy home since 1965, feels the neighborhood should be allowed to evolve, unimpeded by external forces.''You can't always go back to the way things were,'' she said, ''and maybe it's better to let the old mix with the new.'' Noting that the city already oversees planning and zoning through various boards, Ms. Uzzo said current controls were enough to prevent ''shacks'' from going up. ''A new house may not be historic,'' she said, ''but so what? It will look like houses look today.''What You'll FindClose-set single-family homes line Park Hill's narrow streets, though there are a few two-family dwellings near the outskirts, where the neighborhood yields to more densely populated Yonkers. There is also a five-story Tudor-style rental, as well as two condominium complexes, totaling 225 units.Most single-family houses were built between 1890 and the 1930s on 50- by 100-foot lots, although some larger homes occupy multiple lots. Last year, a house tour sponsored by the Park Hill Residents' Association featured a Colonial Revival built in 1898 with a domed elliptical dining room; a 1912 brick Georgian Revival; a 1907 American Foursquare colonial with an elaborate oak interior; and a 1903 Shingle-style home.Colin Cooke, a commercial still-life photographer, says he had several reasons for moving to Park Hill, among them its proximity to Manhattan and the diversity of the neighborhood's housing stock.''Because of the variety of the architecture,'' Mr. Cooke said, ''a lot of creative types have gravitated here.'' He and his wife, Elizabeth, a yoga teacher, live with their sons, Ian, 10, and Dillon, 6, in a 1907 Arts-and-Crafts-style home painted cream, sage green and mocha. The four-story, 2,600-square-foot structure cost them $350,000 in 1998.Especially compared with other Westchester locales, he said, Park Hill is affordable.One reason for that is the persistently afflicted public school system, which has for decades had a dampening effect on property values. The school district's troubles came to a head in the mid-1980s, when a federal judge found the racially divided city guilty of intentional segregation in its housing and education. Although desegregation was imposed shortly after the finding, the district continues to suffer from chronic budget deficits and teacher strikes.The Cooke boys both attend the public schools. ''We thought we'd give it a try,'' Mrs. Cooke said, ''at least for elementary school.'' The Cookes, who are white, say having their children in racially integrated classrooms is important to them.Their house has two side lots, which they are seeking to preserve as open space through a conservation easement. They bought one lot from a developer who had been planning to build on it and, Mr. Cooke said, ''might not have appreciated the historical value of this area.'' He said other neighbors were similarly buying up land, hoping to preserve it.What You'll PayA neighborhood record was set 18 months ago with the sale of a 12,000-square-foot Normandy Tudor for $2.5 million, according to Jane McAfee, a broker for Houlihan Lawrence.An 1890 neo-Classical colonial in need of work, with seven bedrooms and three baths, recently sold for $715,000, she said, and an updated four-bedroom 1920s colonial in good condition went for $685,000.Now on the market, a 97-year-old colonial with eight bedrooms is listed at $1.195 million; a 1951 Cape Cod with three bedrooms is listed for $619,000; and a 1920s three-bedroom colonial is for sale at $539,000.One new arrival, Holland Utley, the design director for Glamour magazine, says she and her partner, Loretta Friedman, a chiropractor and nutritionist, moved last year from a sixth-floor walk-up rental in the Chelsea section of Manhattan to a five-bedroom, 99-year-old colonial that cost them about $750,000.They began their search in Pelham, but chose Yonkers, Ms. Utley said, because houses in Park Hill were far less expensive. ''With the savings,'' she added, ''we had some money left over for renovations.''Another draw is that taxes in Yonkers are about half those in Pelham, whose highly regarded schools have driven up property values. For example, taxes on the four-bedroom colonial that recently sold for $715,000 were $8,990; on a similar house in Pelham, Ms. McAfee said, they would be two or three times that.What to Do''Sometimes I feel like we live on an island,'' Ms. Utley said, ''especially because there aren't any good local shops or restaurants close by and we have to drive everywhere.'' But what the neighborhood lacks in amenities, it makes up for in parks and clubs.The private Racquet Club on Park Hill advertises swimming, tennis, bowling and social activities, ''to help turn neighbors into friends.''On the neighborhood's edge, the Leslie Sutherland Park offers a 20-mile unimpeded vista encompassing everything from Midtown to the Hudson shoreline, stretching almost to the Tappan Zee Bridge.As for dining, the area around Getty Square on the river offers a variety, but it is not close by. Theaters and shopping are even farther away, on the eastern edge of Yonkers in the Cross County Shopping Center, an open-air mall dating back to 1954.The city is considering a $3.6 billion plan to transform the downtown near the waterfront, but approval of that is months, if not years, away. A minor league baseball field is envisioned, as well as theaters and housing. But getting there from Park Hill would still involve a drive.The CommuteDepending on traffic, it is a 30-minute drive to the West Side of Manhattan from Park Hill, via the Saw Mill River and Henry Hudson Parkways.Metro-North Railroad provides 30-minute service from Yonkers's Getty Square Station to Grand Central Terminal. Monthly tickets are $197.24 if bought on the Web, slightly more if bought at a station.The SchoolsSome opt for the public schools, but many, like Kim Fader, a resident since the late 1980s, send their children elsewhere. Her daughter, Sophie, 16, attends the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. When her son, Benjamin, 21, now in college, was starting kindergarten, the city was battling a teachers' strike, and Ms. Fader enrolled him in the Dobbs Ferry system, paying tuition there and ferrying him.''Clearly,'' she said, ''the public school system in Yonkers has been a big challenge, and it continues to be.''The district -- comprising 29 elementary schools, 5 middle schools and 5 high schools -- has an enrollment of 24,708. In the year ending in 2006, average SAT scores were 430 on the verbal and 427 on math, versus state averages of 493 and 510.The HistorySince the American Real Estate Company began building on Park Hill, many well-known figures have been residents -- among them, in the 1910s and 20s, the English actor Richard Bennett and his daughters, Joan and Constance. During that era another resident, Dennis O'Brien, the United Artists counsel, had guests including Charlie Chaplin, George M. Cohan and Mary Pickford.A SnapshotLove it or hate it, the wealth of well-preserved architecture makes Park Hill stand out, especially in an era of new homes built to identical floor plans.Going ForwardThe question is whether the neighborhood will retain its old-fashioned look, and as Ms. Uzzo put it, that is ''a tough call.'' Lee Ellman, Yonkers's planning director, says historic designation would ''put teeth in efforts to enforce historic preservation,'' by requiring approval of new roofs and windows, and tree removal.Two neighborhoods have municipal landmark designation: Cedar Knolls, which consists of 140 homes near Bronxville; and Halcyon Place, about 18 homes on Warburton Avenue on the west side of town. An effort to make a landmark of Lawrence Park West, also near Bronxville, failed at the same time as the Park Hill bid.Living In | Park Hill, Yonkers, N.Y.</text></article><article id="1833851"><summary>Correction; Feb 18 In the Region/New Jersey article misstated location of warehouse and shopping area discussed</summary><text>The ''In the Region'' article in New Jersey copies on Feb. 18, about the conversion of two old buildings in New Jersey into up-to-date residences, misstated the area of Hoboken in which one of the properties, the Coconut Building warehouse, is located.

In the 1820s, the street was filled with little brick houses like the one at the northeast corner, No. 34, which in 1829 was occupied by Walter Heyer, a baker.Trade began arriving by the 1830s, and after the Civil War a building boom remade White, Walker and adjacent streets into a dry-goods center.For instance, 39 White Street, a Greek Revival house, was occupied in the 1840s by Seth Grosvenor, a merchant who died in 1857. In 1861, his estate added two floors, keeping the narrow three-abreast windows. More typical were entirely new structures, like the one his heirs built eight years later at 64-66 White, its cornice emblazoned with the Grosvenor name.An 1863 advertisement in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle by Stevens &amp; Carples, a military goods supplier in the newly rebuilt Grosvenor house, was revealing of the Civil War-era White Street: ''Operators wanted with their own machines -- good operators can make from $7 to $10 per week.''Although SoHo is known for its cast iron, builders on White Street used masonry more often than not -- like the marble front of No. 40, which is Italianate in style with an unusual frieze of three swags at the top, surmounted by the simple carved year, ''1866.''The Italianate-style facade of No. 44 White, built in 1868, has lovely khaki-colored Nova Scotia stone, the kind used on the Dakota. It seems to have been cleaned recently and is now nearly luminous.Across the street, an unusual marble structure, at 43-45, is being advertised as ''Luxury Loft Rentals.'' In 1868, when the craze for mansard roofs was white-hot, an unidentified architect went all out with an imposing colonnaded facade, leading to a frieze of swags at the top of the fifth floor, itself topped by a three-part mansard roof with a pair of oculi.In 1872, a committee of the Board of Underwriters condemned the widespread use of these wood-framed roofs, specifically noting their concentration on White Street. The New York Times reported that there were at least 150 of these roofs downtown and quoted the Board of Underwriters as calling them ''huge tinderboxes.''Across the street are the ambitious Wood's Mercantile Buildings, at 46 and 48-50. The first five floors are strictly ho-hum, but they are set off by a broad marble cornice all across the top proclaiming, in raised letters, ''18 -- Wood's Mercantile Buildings -- 65.''Although these old lofts have a secondhand look now, the prominent label gives an idea of the importance -- or at least the pretensions -- of the building's investors, Abraham and Samuel Wood.Peaceful as it is now, when operating at full tilt White Street was an unforgiving machine. In 1904, The Times reported on a Children's Court hearing involving Louis Deimstein, who was 14 and worked for an unidentified firm in the Wood's Mercantile Buildings.He did not know where his parents were and wanted only to be left alone so he could look after his 11-year-old brother, with whom he lived at the Newsboys' Lodging House, a well-known charitable enterprise. ''I earn $4 a week, and that is enough to keep my brother and myself,'' he told the court.Nevertheless, a guardian was assigned to look after the boys ''until their parents can be found and compelled to support them,'' The Times reported.Little changed on the street until 1965, when the Civic Center Synagogue, at No. 47, was built for worshipers from local businesses still in the neighborhood. Designed by William Breger, with a giant, pillowy curve, its recessed facade cannot be seen from either end of the block, but it is astonishing when suddenly revealed.The cast-iron loft at No. 55, with a second exposure on Franklin Place, a tiny alley, is the most architecturally imposing work on the block. It was designed by John Kellum and built in 1861 as an investment by John and Samuel Condict, two saddlers. The high arcades and intricate detail were cast by Daniel Badger, although much of the present ornamentation is replacement work.As the industrial centers of Manhattan began to decline in the 1950s, residential tenants moved to White Street, along with some ''downtown'' type enterprises: Let There Be Neon, at 38; the Flea Theater, at 41; and the Manhattan Children's Theater, at 52.Among the conversion projects now under way is the western portion of the Wood's Mercantile complex. Yet despite these, White Street has not followed SoHo's lead. It can be empty on weekends.Edward I. Mills, an architect who has worked in 48-50 White Street for 17 years, said that when he moved in, the residential invasion of the street's upper floors was well under way, although most of the ground-floor spaces still held fabric warehouses.Mr. Mills said that because retail rents had not risen as much as residential rents, most of the ground-floor spaces on White were now occupied by residential tenants. He put the value of residential lofts in TriBeCa at $1,000 to $1,500 per square foot.Mr. Mills is working on a building renovation at 408 Broadway, near Walker Street, and he believes that SoHo retailers are poised to jump the Canal Street barrier. When that happens, he said, ''everything south of Canal will start changing.''Streetscapes | White Street E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1833856"><summary>Mortgages column on wisdom of paying off mortgage before lenders require (M)</summary><text>AS many homeowners dip into their home equity, a small but growing number are doing the opposite -- paying off their mortgages quicker than lenders require.But is ending a mortgage sooner than necessary a wise move? There's no simple answer. Financial advisers disagree sharply about whether, and when, such an approach makes sense.''I talk with clients about this every day, probably five, six times a day,'' said Jonathan Satovsky, an investment adviser in Manhattan with Ameriprise Financial, a financial management company based in Minneapolis. Mr. Satovsky generally warns his clients against prepaying.First, he said, assuming that the homeowner has a 6.25 percent fixed-rate mortgage and is in the 20 percent income-tax bracket, the net interest rate -- after mortgage interest is deducted on tax returns -- is about 4 percent. Although homeowners would save that 4 percent by paying off their mortgages, he said, they would earn more than 4 percent interest if they invested the money instead.''There might be periods where the markets go backward, and you think it's a mistake,'' he said. ''But over 10, 15 years, they'll earn a lot more by not prepaying.''In addition, he said, because mortgage interest is front-loaded, the interest deduction drops sharply in the later years of the mortgage.Andrew Schweitzer, the chief executive of the Gulfstream Financial Corporation, an advisory service in Sunrise, Fla., disagreed. ''The goal should be to free up earned income so you can accumulate it for retirement,'' he said. ''If I'm paying $24,000 a year on a mortgage, I may have saved $8,000 a year in taxes. But if I didn't have a mortgage, I would have saved $24,000 in overall expenses. It's not rocket science.''By clearing the debt earlier, you pay much less over all in interest over the life of the loan, and free that money for investment.Mr. Schweitzer's company sells a service that essentially uses clients' money to pay bills on their behalf, choosing debts with the highest interest rates first. Typical clients, he said, have about $120,000 in annual household income and carry about $120,000 in debt, from cars, mortgages, home-equity credit lines and credit cards.With the service, Mr. Schweitzer said, assuming the clients spend the same amount but stop using credit cards, their total debt, including mortgages, is typically paid off within eight years. The average client, he said, saves about $200,000 in interest by paying off the debt in less than the full period allowed and pays Gulfstream $1,500 for the service.Clients can save and invest their money for retirement, he said, and achieve financial independence more quickly than they would have while carrying debt.(There is an important caveat -- some mortgages carry prepayment penalties, which can total thousands of dollars, so borrowers should check with their lenders for details.)Other services offering guidance, like PlasticEconomy.com's Track Cards, help homeowners choose which debts to pay off first but do not manage the client's money directly and typically do not include mortgage payments.Should homeowners choose to prepay their mortgages, Mr. Satovsky of Ameriprise suggests they take out a home-equity line of credit before they begin. ''Prepaying is dangerous,'' he said, if the homeowners' equity is completely locked into the value of the house and they are not disciplined savers.''You could have $2 million in equity in the home and say you're ready to retire,'' he said. ''I say: 'Great! What will you live on? Social Security? You spend $20,000 a month.' ''If the homeowner then becomes disabled or unemployed, he may not qualify for a home-equity loan when he needs money, Mr. Satovsky said.MORTGAGES</text></article><article id="1833868"><summary>Bernadette Murray and Randey Fertel wed in New Orleans; photos (M) (Vows Column)</summary><text>THE chatter among the 175 guests gathered under the live oaks of Audubon Park in New Orleans for the wedding of Bernadette Murray and Randy Fertel was upbeat but also circumspect. They gushed about the setting and marveled about the beauty of the bride. And barely a word about the tough times the couple had just been through.Less measured were the bride's grade-school-age nephews: ''Don't tell,'' one said in a stage whisper. ''Aunt Bernadette is wearing a wig!''Aunt Bernadette has been wearing a wig since shortly after she began treatment in May 2005 for acute myeloid leukemia, several months after Ms. Murray began dating Mr. Fertel.Early on, Ms. Murray tried to let Mr. Fertel off the hook, telling him that she didn't expect him to endure what appeared to be a long illness. Mr. Fertel responded by returning to the hospital with a big diamond ring in a blue Tiffany box.''I felt like she needed to know I wasn't going anywhere,'' said Mr. Fertel, who is 56 and works part of the year at the New School in New York, where he is an adjunct instructor, specializing in the literature of the Vietnam War.He was in New York in late 2004 when the couple became acquainted, through a dating Web site. Ms. Murray, a Manhattanite, saw Mr. Fertel's online portrait, with his tousled hair and a goatee, and expressed her interest. ''He had such an earnest face, so I read on,'' she recalled.He in turn scanned her profile and responded, ''I know that you like to cook, what do you cook?''She said, apologetically, that unlike many of her fellow New Yorkers, she's a ''rabid carnivore.''She need not have apologized. Mr. Fertel, an easygoing, witty, divorced native New Orleanian, is a son of the late Ruth Fertel, who founded the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain there. (His father, Rodney Fertel, ran a quixotic campaign for mayor of New Orleans in 1969 that was notable for its sole focus on the need to obtain a gorilla for the Audubon Zoo there.)Their first meeting, at Babbo, the Greenwich Village restaurant, went badly, at least according to Ms. Murray, now 48. ''It was not a great first date,'' she said. ''All his answers were monosyllabic.''The evening was salvaged during the long walk they took afterward, and their next date was cemented as Mr. Fertel put her into a cab. ''He asked if he could give me a kiss,'' she said. ''That got him the second date -- he's a good kisser.''Subsequent dates in New York went more smoothly, but it was on a visit to New Orleans -- where he is head of the Fertel Foundation, which finances art, education and culinary projects, and also the Ruth U. Fertel Foundation, dedicated to education in Louisiana -- that the never-before-married Ms. Murray truly fell for him. While in town she met Mr. Fertel's longtime circle of friends. ''Creeps don't have good friends,'' she said.Mr. Fertel explained his attraction. ''Here was this incredible, successful executive who was at the top of her game but wasn't cutthroat,'' he said of Ms. Murray, who was an executive vice president at BBDO, the advertising firm in New York, before becoming the associate publisher for marketing and creative services at House &amp; Garden magazine. Mr. Fertel also liked that she was driven but generous.Ms. Murray, one of a family of nine children who grew up in Kent, N.Y., nearly vibrates with energy and warmth. She is the one who keeps guests' wineglasses filled, arranges internships for nieces, asks about co-workers' children and takes home-cooked meals to sick relatives.After their first few dates, Mr. Fertel said he knew he was serious about her. But he also was in no hurry to commit. Then came Ms. Murray's chest pains, which led to tests and the diagnosis that rapidly altered the timeline of their relationship.The cure was less swift. She received a bone-marrow transplant at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in September 2005, but during her treatment she became bald, wilted to 88 pounds and couldn't go out in public for nearly a year, while her immune system rebuilt itself.At times it was embarrassing to be so needy and fragile in front of someone she had dated only for a short time, Ms. Murray recalled. ''I weighed nothing, my head was swollen, and my hair was coming out in clumps, so we had a barber come shave my head,'' she said. ''I couldn't move, I couldn't lift my head.''During that period, she recalled one day when Mr. Fertel visited her with tubes of fancy lotions: ''I looked down and thought, 'There is this man at the end of the bed that I hardly know who is rubbing my feet so that I'll feel better.' ''In January last year, as she was recovering, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. ''I thought this was just about too much,'' Mr. Fertel said. ''But I couldn't bring myself to desert her. She needed me.''Mr. Fertel was also concerned about how Ms. Murray would emerge from her illness. ''If she made it through, I didn't know if she would be the person I fell in love with,'' he said. ''It was a crapshoot, but I come from a family of gamblers.''Because Ms. Murray was too fragile for chemotherapy, she had a mastectomy followed by breast-reconstruction surgery. By July 2006, her blood work showed no sign of cancer.The couple are splitting their time between New York and New Orleans, but they chose to marry in the Crescent City, partly because they felt symmetry with the city's destruction and climb back to life.The process began on March 9, when they were joined in a civil ceremony at the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, officiated by Judge Madeleine Landrieu. When Judge Landrieu, reading the service from a three-ring binder, asked whether they would take each other ''in sickness and in health,'' the couple's eyes welled up.In keeping with the couple's theme, at their public ceremony on March 10, the jazz musician Kermit Ruffins raised his trumpet to the sunny sky and walked up the aisle playing ''Just a Closer Walk With Thee,'' a traditional New Orleans funeral dirge, for their processional. Though not empowered to marry the couple legally in that city, Ben Fong-Torres, the rock journalist and a Universal Life minister, led a service in which he talked about Ms. Murray's illness and how at one point in their courtship Ms. Murray had swooned when Mr. Fertel played for her an Olu Dara tune that went: ''Your lips, your lips, your lips are juice-saaayyyy'' like a Louisiana plum.The bride wore a copper-colored silk dress and carried orange and yellow tulips; the bridegroom wore a dark-blue tuxedo with black lapels and a black silk bow tie. Her little white dog, Bonnie, carried the rings on her collar.Afterward Mr. Ruffins and his band struck up an upbeat and joyous funeral tune, and led the guests to a reception at Mr. Fertel's home, an Arts and Crafts home built in 1915, which borders the park.As the adult guests sipped wine and ate canap&#233;s in the yard, the nephews sneaked into the dinner tent and attempted to rearrange the place cards so that they could sit next to their aunt. A waiter followed discreetly behind them and rearranged the cards so the bridegroom could be, as always, beside his rosy-cheeked bride in her renaissance.WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS</text></article><article id="1833869"><summary>Coats for women this spring have sexy, feminine tailoring and witty details; photos (M)</summary><text>Winter's sharp edge is finally easing, and shoppers are seeking lighter coverage.

Her new film, ''The Namesake,'' was having its premiere in two New York theaters: uptown at the Paris Theater and downtown at the Angelika Film Center.Ms. Nair (rhymes with fire) was drinking scotch on the rocks at Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel and fidgeting with anticipation over the debut. Her entourage included Jhumpa Lahiri, the author of the novel cum film; Arjun Bhasin, the film's costume designer; and Lydia Dean Pilcher, Ms. Nair's longtime producing partner.Kal Penn, the film's star, was off shooting the sequel to ''Harold and Kumar'' but was there in spirit as the group recounted his story of a very confused friend who couldn't understand why an Indian book had a Japanese title: ''The Nah-muh-sah-kay.'' The name stuck, and the cast and crew like to joke about it. So the Nah-muh-sah-kay gang -- a bunch of giddy, giggling adults -- piled into a car and arrived at the Paris for the 7:30 show.Ms. Nair, 49, tumbled out of the car, nothing cool and collected about her as she sprinted to the marquee, past a man pleading with the ticket seller for a seat to the sold-out showing. But her bliss was momentarily marred by scaffolding that blocked the marquee. Steel bars and all, she took a photograph for posterity.Ms. Nair surveyed the crowd indoors, looking as if she wanted to embrace each and every person simply for being there. She turned to a manager of the Paris, Stavroula Toska, and said reverently: ''I studied film in this theater. This place is a citadel for me.'' Barely pausing, she added, ''Could you turn the volume up? The music is so beautiful and there are so many people, you can't hear it.''''She's always directing something,'' Mr. Bhasin kidded.Afterward, referring to the crowds, Ms. Nair sighed and said, ''That was something else.''Every so often she would train her large, warm eyes on her colleagues, as if to register: yes, this thing we dreamed of is happening. She wore a coat made of old cloth from Uzbekistan called a suzani, which was faded black with embroidered red circles and yellow and white zigzags.She said she wore it monastically while filming, having decided it was a literal reference to Gogol's short story ''The Overcoat,'' which figures into ''The Namesake.'' (Plot spoiler: it is not a Russian film.) The movie is rolling out across the country over the next several weeks.Ms. Lahiri was subdued, perhaps because she is something of a recluse, but she was also fighting a cold. (The cold seemed to be ahead.) She did, though, kvell over the movie. ''I feel like the grandmother,'' she said, ''all of the joy and none of the pain.''At Omen, a Japanese restaurant in SoHo, Ms. Nair's 15-year-old son, Zohran, arrived bearing flowers, and it looked as if his mother might melt. Everyone cooed over dishes of avocado and yam salad and black cod, until Zohran made an edamame gaffe: ''Oh, God, I'm eating the eaten part,'' he said, putting down the bowl of discarded shells.After dessert, Ms. Nair and company headed to the Angelika for a 10:20 showing. Peeking her head into a theater for the opening credits, Ms. Nair signaled to the vice president for operations standing nearby.''So many people,'' she said, ''the volume could go up.''She added: ''This is an important theater to me. I saw many of the most important films here.''There is no denying Mira Nair could charm the skin off a snake and then sell snakeskin boots back to the snake. If snakes wore boots. Up went the volume.A Night Out With Mira Nair</text></article><article id="1833872"><summary>Bill Cunningham On the Street photos of women wearing miniskirts; photos (M)</summary><text>It's starting to look like the 1960s again on the streets of New York.

Can you say the same of d&#233;cor?Consider the antique pool table in the New York studio of the artist Philip Taaffe. Made in 1920s by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender company in a lavish quasi-Egyptian-Moorish Revival style, the table was then the height of luxury, among the first to have a system to whoosh all the pocketed balls quietly down to a green-felt-lined wooden tray fitted at one end.One would expect the table to be part of Mr. Taaffe's perfectly articulated bohemian gentleman aesthetic, which has turned his enormous studio on the top floor of a dull garment district building into one of the most spectacular work spaces in the city.There is a huge main room with 16 1/2-foot ceilings, soaring trefoil-arched windows, a terrace and a half-dozen side rooms, each with dedicated contents: a library for books, an office for papers and personalia, a room for flat files, even a conservatory for his beloved Victorian-style collection of potted palms.It is practically a Clue game board: you wonder if there is a secret passage to the glamorous Hotel Chelsea apartment where he lives with his wife, Gretchen, and two young sons. In the billiard room there is even a malevolent candlestick in the shape of a coiled cobra. Mr. Taaffe's seductive abstractions -- paintings that mix geometry, non-Western ethnic motifs, organic shapes and a splash of Rorschach -- are hung there, too, and they have never looked better.But surely the decorative pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance is that pool table, recalling in this aesthete's lair the most genteelly roguish of pastimes.Well, it is and it isn't. You need only watch Mr. Taaffe take out a pool cue and set to work clearing the table, and fast, to realize that the man is, as they would say in the old pool halls, a ringer. This fact is borne out by the triad of trophies that he won in 1968 and 1969 as a suburban New Jersey teenager for whom pool was a total obsession.So a few years ago, he fell in love with another table as soon as a vintage-billiards dealer near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., showed it to him. But his moment of true rapture came upon realizing it was the same table that Willie Mosconi, his childhood hero, was using in the photographs in his 1948 how-to book, ''Willie Mosconi on Pocket Billiards.''''I remember all these guys,'' he said. ''I even saw some of them play. For instance, there was Machine Gun Lou Butera, who could run 150 balls in a half an hour.''''I have a lot of lore,'' he said as he deftly sank another ball. ''There are very few people out there who understand the culture of pool. People think of it as very hedonistic, but once you get to a certain level, it's very highly disciplined in its exactitude and infinitude. The level of vision it takes -- the way the edges of the spheres meet and collide at a particular point, and the number of points that exist with any given shot -- you have to be much more precise than you do as an artist.''And, he added, ''I was a very poor geometry student.''Still, watching Mr. Taaffe pocket the balls, you cannot help but think that his way of making both playing pool and creating art look easy are not dissimilar. As decorative as his own abstractions appear at a glance -- a new show is up at the Gagosian Gallery on the Upper East Side -- they possess a degree of imagination, precision and care only hinted at in each painting's offhand sense of exotic geometry.Perhaps it is best not to judge anyone -- pool player or artist -- by his aesthetic. He may be holding out on you.POSSESSED</text></article><article id="1833878"><summary>Fatty Crab in New York City is featuring drink Poona Club on its new cocktail menu; photo (M)</summary><text>DO not be fooled. The Poona Club is just a state of mind.Duly forewarned, you may now peruse the newly added cocktail menu at Fatty Crab on Hudson Street, which recently received its liquor license and has this to say about its Poona Club cocktail: ''Back in the days of British India, the Poona Club was famous for its -- well, you'll have to look it up.''Because the drink is so exotically appealing (a vivid mixture of blood-orange juice, red vermouth, bitters and Tanqueray's new Rangpur gin, which is distilled with limes, ginger and bay leaves), and because I'm a reporter of some boozy diligence, I did look it up.There is indeed a Poona Club, in Maharashtra, India, and this golf club appears to be famous for absolutely nothing save for a tough par-4 opening hole.''Yeah, I wanted to send people off to do some fruitless Googling,'' said David Wondrich, the cocktail consultant and writer who created the cocktail menu at Fatty Crab, Zak Pelaccio's fashionably cramped Southeast Asian restaurant.''I was looking for an Indian club to name it after but then decided to make up my own British officers' club and pass off the drink as the club's original recipe. So I called it the Poona Club, which had the added advantage of sounding vaguely dirty. I only found out later that there actually is a Poona Club.''Which brings me to my subject: the naming of cocktails.Most chefs would break into tears if they not only had to create entrees but also had to affix them with catchy titles.(The exception is the Chinese-American restaurant; witness the genius of a chicken-and-egg dish called ''the Mother and Child Reunion.'')And while some mixologists do loathe the naming process, others relish it.''It's almost like set decorating,'' Mr. Wondrich said. ''Every good cocktail should have its own identity.''Like baby names, cocktail names are steered by trends: the smuttily named drinks of the '70s and '80s -- ''two Buttery Nipples, please'' -- led to the ''-tini'' phase, which spiraled out of control in the late '90s and hit bottom with the Apple Pie-tini.Nowadays, antiquing is in fashion.''The drift is toward classic-sounding names,'' said Jonathan Pogash, a New York cocktail consultant and the director of cocktail development at the Campbell Apartment and several other Manhattan bars.Mixologists, Mr. Wondrich said, ''are trying to sneak their drinks into the canon by coming up with names that sound a hundred years old.''''It's forgery,'' said Mr. Wondrich, the proprietor of the fictional, famous Poona Club.

And just like that I was swept up in one of the unseen subterranean currents of the city, the current of lost and found. It holds you longer than you'd expect. It holds you and spins you around and around. I looked down behind me, and there was my glove on the sidewalk.I picked up the glove and thanked each of the three people who had intervened on my behalf.An hour or so later, I walked into a Starbucks and saw, on the floor, a wad of cash. I picked it up. It was a 10 and a 5. Not a fortune, but no insubstantial sum, either.''Is this yours?'' I asked the man who was standing at the cream and sugar counter, next to where the cash had lain. He said it wasn't.Another person said he thought the money belonged to a woman who had just left.''Which way did she go?'' I asked.''To the right.''''Describe her.''''She was with a kid.''Out the door, to the right -- I moved quickly, and soon I saw a woman with a little girl. Right before I caught up with them, they turned into a Barnes &amp; Noble, and I followed.Just as I came up behind the woman, the girl dropped her pink hat. It fell to the floor like a weightless little cloud. This seemed proof enough that between the two of them, they couldn't hold onto anything.''Excuse me!'' I practically shouted. They stopped and turned. I pointed to the girl's hat. And then, seized with feelings of chivalry and perhaps excitement at my imminent gesture of altruism, I bent down and picked it up for her. The woman said thank you.Then, holding out the crumpled bills, I asked, ''Is this yours?'' The woman looked confused, glanced down into her purse, then again at the bills. ''Fifteen dollars?'' she said.''Yes.''''I think it is,'' she said with a smile. The little girl in the pink hat hardly took notice. Perhaps this sort of thing happened all the time, I thought. Perhaps people run up to her mother and return things she has dropped every day.All this would have been no more than a bit of random city choreography were it not for the fact that a couple of days later I went home and realized that my wallet was not in the pocket of my coat. Deep panic. A lost glove is annoying, but a lost wallet is a statement. It means that you have misplaced your identity, your money and your credit cards, along with various gift certificates, accumulated over various holidays and birthdays, given to you by your mother. What does it mean to be so careless with love and money?I tore through the apartment and then emptied every pocket in my coat. Just before I had gone home, I rushed out of a deli with my wallet and loose dollar bills in one hand, a sandwich in the other. I now had the sandwich but not the wallet. Maybe in my moment of haste, I had pushed it into what I thought was a pocket, but was in fact thin air, and it had fallen to the street.I pictured my wallet lying on the street. I wanted to rush outside to look for it. Then I thought: ''No, don't do that. It's crazy to think it's lying in the street. Keep looking in here.''BUT barely a minute went by before I was standing in front of the open refrigerator. There comes a time in all searches for objects lost at home when one capitulates to the irrational urge to check the fridge. You realize that rationally, there is no way that whatever you are looking for is in the refrigerator. But it isn't anywhere else, and what's the harm in looking?No sooner had I seen the fridge light blink on than I slammed it shut and raced outside. What is more irrational, looking for your wallet in the fridge, or on a city street?I trotted back to the deli, eyes on the ground. I know there are worse tragedies than losing your wallet, but are there worse feelings than walking down a city block in New York looking at the ground with the deluded idea that your wallet, containing 80 bucks and credit cards and driver's license and gift certificates from your mother, will be simply lying on the street untouched?In front of the deli, right in the middle of West Fourth Street, wet, flattened by many tires, lay my wallet.But it wasn't over. The next day I sat in a diner on Prince Street and watched placidly as a tall man strode confidently down the street, chin high in the air, while his wallet slipped out of his back pocket. A woman walking in the opposite direction picked it up. I leapt to my feet, not sure which of them to address, the loser or the finder. I went after the guy. ''Hey!'' I called. He didn't hear me or ignored me. He was wearing a big black puffy down jacket. I slapped him on the back, quite hard. ''Hey!'' I said again, full of self-recognition. It was all I could do to refrain from adding, ''Idiot!''I went back to my seat in the diner and watched as the man explained himself to the woman, and she handed him his wallet, smiles all around. Her gesture seemed to bring me full circle to the dropped glove; a cycle was complete. For a while after that, I didn't lose anything.NEW YORK OBSERVED Thomas Beller is the author of ''Seduction Theory,'' a collection of short stories, and the editor of Open City Magazine and Mrbellersneighborhood.com.</text></article><article id="1833894"><summary>Article on bars in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that are offering free food and sometimes even free drinks; photo (M)</summary><text>At the Trash Bar on Grand Street in Williamsburg, the smell of fried potatoes hangs heavy in the air. At a booth fashioned out of car seats from junkyard vans, three 20-somethings fish potato nuggets out of a cardboard container, then dunk them in ketchup before gobbling them down. And the best part about them? They're free -- with the price of a drink.Free food, now rarely found in New York, was once a staple of its bars.''Before Prohibition, people were constantly trying to restrict alcohol,'' said Jef Klein, author of ''The History and Stories of the Best Bars of New York.'' ''A big complaint about bars was that guys would drink on an empty stomach. Free lunch offers popped up everywhere -- you had to buy the drink to get the lunch.'' Hence the phrase ''No such thing as a free lunch.''Now a quartet of Williamsburg and Greenpoint bars -- the Trash Bar, the Alligator Lounge, Capone's and Lost and Found -- are leading the return to free foods, featuring items like pizza, hot dogs and bagels.According to Christine McCluskey, who manages Capone's and the Alligator Lounge, the idea surfaced in 2003, when the jungle-themed Alligator Lounge opened in what had been a pizzeria. Rather than tear out the brick oven, the owners decided to give away a 12-inch pie with each beer. The Trash Bar came next with potato nuggets, Capone's followed with pizza, and Lost and Found, a new bar in Greenpoint, offers hot dogs, veggie dogs and bagels.According to state liquor licenses, the four bars all have an owner in common, John McGillion. But other establishments are following suit in these free-food policies, among them the Lazy Catfish, a comfort-food restaurant on Lorimer Street that recently began offering complimentary snacks after the kitchen closes at 9:30 p.m. ''Hot dogs keep people here instead of going somewhere to get something to eat,'' explained Thomas Mak, the manager.At some places, even the beer is sometimes free. The Williamsburg White Room, a new space for parties and concerts, offers free keg beer during certain hours, a strategy that Steve Martinez, the owner, says attracts night owls to the bar earlier, and extends a thank-you to musicians who bring patrons in to hear them perform.''Being a musician, there've been times when I brought 100 people to a show and only got five drink tickets,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''It doesn't cost a lot -- $50 to $100 -- and it makes a lot of people happy.''Meanwhile, at the Levee, a two-year-old bar on Berry Street in Williamsburg, customers can nibble on free cheese puffs and Blow Pops while enjoying the bar's extensive collection of board games.''We made a Costco run, and they had huge barrels of cheese puffs,'' said Howard Hunt, the bar's owner. ''And we thought the Blow Pops would be good for smokers, so they'd have something to do with their hands.''KATE TORGOVNICKNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WILLIAMSBURG/GREENPOINT</text></article><article id="1833895"><summary>Op-Ed article by Colin Beavan on efforts he and his family are taking to live green life in New York City apartment for one year (M)</summary><text>FOR the year beginning last December, my wife, our 2-year-old daughter and I, while living in the middle of the city, are trying to survive without making any net impact on the environment. This means we'll get as close as we can to creating no trash (so no takeout), emitting no carbon dioxide (so no driving or flying) and pouring no toxins in the water (so no laundry detergent), as well as mitigating impacts we can't avoid (so planting trees). Not to mention: no elevators, subways, buying products in packaging, plastics, air-conditioning, TV or toilet paper.Though I'm ashamed to admit it, this is the first time I've substantially changed my life to reflect my beliefs. I have boycotted products that contributed to the hole in the ozone layer; written letters against the Japanese for hunting whales; called for an end to the poaching of Congolese gorillas; marched against the whites who controlled South Africa in the apartheid era; detested the Israeli killing of Palestinians; and despised Palestinian killing of Israelis. But I made the mistake of believing that condemning the misdeeds of others somehow made me virtuous.With age, I even ratcheted down my political action and veered perilously close to joining that brand of liberal who whines about the world but doesn't actually do anything about it. If I were still a student, I'd probably march against my adult self. And, as a member of that passive group of do-nothings, I was far from alone.Prof. Arthur Brooks of Syracuse University, in his recent book ''Who Really Cares,'' published data showing that, for all our liberal ideology, people like me volunteer their time no more than conservatives, and we actually donate 30 percent less to charity. We even give less blood.''It's not that liberals are selfish,'' Professor Brooks told me on the phone. Rather, he said, they worry that individual action lets everybody else off the hook. Believing to a large degree that, as Professor Brooks put it, ''societal coercion is better than individual action,'' they prefer to exert their efforts on grand schemes to change the government and the laws.So people like me work to get out the vote, but feel entitled to heat our empty homes all day because, hey, we've done our best. Liberals, Professor Brooks said, ''are suffering from cognitive dissonance -- because the way they live their lives is not in accord with their ethics.''And anyway, with global warming, there is no time to wait around for a strategy of ''societal coercion'' to take effect. But can individual New Yorkers really help? Isn't this really a problem for the sub- and ex-urbanites who guzzle gas in their S.U.V.'s? After all, 78 percent of Manhattan households don't even have cars -- can't we content ourselves with the eco-efficiency of our crammed-together little island? Not when you consider that, together with the rest of our state, New Yorkers make nearly 1 percent of the world's carbon dioxide, the predominant greenhouse gas.So my family and I have started our experiment in extreme environmental living. We keep a bin full of worms that turn our organic waste into compost. We make our own yogurt, staying away from those nasty plastic tubs. We grow herbs on our windowsills.We've faced a million problems -- how to make a meal without creating a mountain of plastic; how to bike through the city streets without ending up with a crushed skull; what to do about diapers -- but we're reaping some unexpected benefits.With all the stair climbing, I've lost 15 pounds. We produce less than half a small bag of trash in a week. My wife loves riding her foot-propelled scooter to work. Family life now centers around the kitchen and dining table, where we talk, instead of around the TV, where we didn't. Even parts of the banks of the Hudson were, a least for a while, a little cleaner because we spent an afternoon picking up garbage (including, God save me, plastic bottles full of urine thrown from vehicles on the West Side Highway). Most of all, we feel that we are not contributing so drastically to the world problems that worry us.I'm not saying that we'll retain our most extreme adaptations when the year is over. I don't know. And I'm certainly not saying we're doing more about the environment than others -- there are many engaged, committed people who do much more than we do.But I like to hope that, at least, we have stopped doing so much less.Op-Ed Contributor Colin Beavan is the author of ''Operation Jedburgh: D-Day and America's First Shadow War'' and the blog No Impact Man.</text></article><article id="1833928"><summary>Bill Cunningham Evening Hours photos of dinners, benefits and dances around New York City</summary><text>EVENING HOURS</text></article><article id="1833960"><summary>Lucie Aubrac, fabled member of French resistance in World War II, who romanticized her exploits, dies at age 94; photo (M)</summary><text>Lucie Aubrac, a French schoolteacher whose melding of romance and resistance to Nazi occupation not only made her resemble Ingrid Bergman's character in ''Casablanca'' but also inspired popular films based on her own life, died Wednesday in a Paris suburb. She was 94.Her death was announced by her daughter, Catherine Vallade, The Associated Press reported.Her status as a hero grew as she published a somewhat fictionalized version of her wartime diaries in 1984; had her life portrayed in movies; and, in 1998, won a highly publicized libel suit against a historian who had questioned her heroism and that of her husband.''She was an emblematic figure of the central role of women in the Resistance,'' Jacques Chirac, the president of France, said Thursday in a statement.Ms. Aubrac several times rescued her husband, Raymond, a leader of what was called the Secret Army, from prison.Once, she confronted Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo officer known as the Butcher of Lyon. She presented herself to Mr. Barbie as a pregnant, unmarried aristocrat whose fianc&#233; had been arrested and imprisoned by mistake.She begged him to let them be married to make the child legitimate.With what she described as ''a queer smile'' in her diary, Barbie opened his desk drawer and took out a portfolio. It contained various papers and cards pertaining to her, as well as a small snapshot of her in a bathing suit on a beach with a baby by her side.The papers she carried identified her as unmarried, calling into question her urgent request: either she was already married and her identification was fake, or she did not care about the public appearance of virtue as much as she had claimed.Barbie demanded to know how long she had known the prisoner, whom he called a terrorist. She stammered six weeks. He threw her out of the office.She later bribed another Nazi officer who did not know she had seen Barbie to let the couple be married in his office. Afterward, in a blaze of gunfire, she and other Resistance members killed the driver and others in the truck taking Mr. Aubrac and 13 other Resistance fighters back to jail and freed them.When Mr. Aubrac was jailed in 1940, she had slipped him pills containing a virus, and he escaped while being transported to a military hospital. Another time, she visited a prosecutor and calmly told him he would not live to see another sunset unless he released Mr. Aubrac.She said in a 1997 interview with European Magazine that when she had gone to see the prosecutor, she said to herself: ''This guy is a collaborator and, therefore, a coward. If I speak louder than him, I'm sure to win.''Lucie Bernard was born on June 29, 1912, in M&#226;con, in the Burgundy region of France, the daughter of a winemaker. She was a young teacher when she met Raymond Samuel in Strasbourg through mutual friends. He had just completed a year's study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and she had a scholarship to study in the United States.Both later adopted the surname Aubrac as one of their underground aliases. They decided to keep it.It was love at first sight. After Ms. Aubrac's diary, translated into English as ''Outwitting the Gestapo,'' was published in 1984, Mr. Aubrac said, he was pleased to read ''that she had experienced an incredible love.''He said, ''I think I could say the same thing.''They did not go to the United States, but married on Dec. 14, 1939, in Dijon. He had warned her it might be risky to marry a Jew, but she said, ''That just made me even more keen.''In October 1940, she joined the Resistance, and he joined a month later. She never had a rank but simply did all that was asked of her. She delivered packages, printed propaganda and hatched and executed escape plans.She lived a dual life as mother of a boy, Boubou, and as a Resistance member who lived at an address known only to a few. She continued to teach, but according to an article in Women's Review of Books in 1994, refused to take her class to an exhibit on ''racial characteristics.''Because Mr. Aubrac was known to the Germans, the couple and their son were evacuated to Britain in February 1944. Ms. Aubrac gave birth to their daughter, Catherine, just days after their arrival.Ms. Aubrac is survived by her husband and three children.She worked for causes like Algerian independence, spoke frequently about her wartime experiences and was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government.In 1998, she and her husband won a libel case against the historian G&#233;rard Chauvy, who suggested that her husband was an informer and that her memory was vague. Barbie said, during his 1984 trial, that Mr. Aubrac had been his informer, but historians have generally rejected that claim.In addition to the movie ''Lucie Aubrac'' (1997), which was directed by Claude Berri and starred Carole Bouquet, two other movies -- Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Army of Shadows'' (1969) and Jos&#233;e Yanne's ''Boulevard of Swallows'' (1991) -- were based at least in part on her life. (The highly acclaimed ''Army of Shadows'' had its first theatrical run in the United States last year.)Lucie and Raymond Aubrac became lovers on May 14, 1939, The Independent reported, and conceived Catherine on that day four years later. Each year, they treated themselves to dinner on May 14 at Le Jules Verne restaurant on the second level of the Eiffel Tower.</text></article><article id="1833990"><summary>Steven M Clayton letter disagrees with March 11 editorial about eminent domain in New Jersey</summary><text>To the Editor:I respectfully disagree with some elements of your editorial about the practice of eminent domain (''Don't Cripple Eminent Domain,'' March 11).It is my view that unless in the rarest of circumstances, eminent domain should not be used.

The common-sense presumption: residency could be ''cured'' once the vote was known -- and before swearing-in.In fact, those agencies disenfranchised all 40th District voters and compelled the re-run -- likely to have the same result -- not any subversive action or misrepresentation by the winner as your editorial suggests.

Safety concerns for school-age children on dark winter mornings have an easy solution already demanded by their biological constitutions: later starts for the school day, well after sunrise.This arrangement has the added benefit of keeping kids off the streets in the midafternoon; after-school programs for K-5ers become before-school programs, and so-called extracurricular activities get built into the school day, where they belong.

He got off the plane, which never left Kennedy Airport.The Royal Air Maroc jetliner had circled the airport -- at ground level -- for twice as long as its scheduled flight to Casablanca, Morocco. It was de-iced twice. The second time, it had the bad luck to fall in line behind an airplane that broke down inside the de-icing station.After the pilot gave up and taxied back to the gate at about 10 a.m., Mr. Colgan, 35, said that a voice on the loudspeaker told a planeload of people whose mood ranged from annoyed to angry: ''We deeply apologize for the delay. The gods are against us.''In the ice storm that pelted the New York area overnight, theirs was not the only flight that the gods of weather and travel had in their sights. A number of flights were stuck on the ground for hours at J.F.K. on Friday night and into yesterday after the unexpectedly icy weather apparently strained the capacity for de-icing, creating new headaches at an airport where hundreds of JetBlue passengers were stranded for as long as 10 hours during a snowstorm last month.Of the flights that were delayed on Friday, the Royal Air Maroc flight appeared to have spent the most time going nowhere. Passengers on a SwissAir flight to Zurich were stuck onboard for eight hours, only to be let off at 3 a.m. A Virgin Atlantic flight to London left 9 1/2 hours late, according to FlightStats.com, a Web site that tracks takeoffs and landings.The Associated Press reported that a Cathay Pacific flight to Vancouver, British Columbia, was finally canceled yesterday after more than nine hours of waiting at J.F.K.Hoping for a break in the weather, Delta Air Lines boarded three flights from Kennedy on Friday evening. But the storm continued, and the three flights were eventually canceled. The planes never left the gates.Many flights were also canceled at La Guardia Airport on Friday, but most flights there appeared to be on schedule yesterday, according to FlightStats.com.Even after the storm had crawled away, it continued to throw off passengers' plans. Continental Airlines canceled 125 flights in the East yesterday. Most were morning flights at Contintental's big hub at Newark Liberty International Airport, where Continental did not begin operations for the day until noon.JetBlue, which canceled 400 of its 550 flights on Friday, moved early to avoid any chance of a rerun of its troubles on Feb. 14. A spokeswoman said yesterday that JetBlue was operating 95 percent of its scheduled flights and with only brief delays.The ice and sleet put unusual pressure on Kennedy's de-icing operations, which are handled by the private companies that operate the terminals.''This storm was the worst type of storm you could have,'' said Edward J. Paquette, the executive director of the management company that runs Terminal 1 at Kennedy, the terminal used by Royal Air Maroc. ''It was freezing rain and sleet that adheres to everything, the flight surfaces, the fuselage, the wings. It's difficult to remove.''Terminal 1, which handles 17 foreign airlines, used 30,000 gallons of de-icing solution on Friday night. Ordinarily, that amount of the liquid, often referred to as glycol, would last half the winter, Mr. Paquette said.Because the slick, sloppy roads made the going slow, ''the folks who deliver the glycol ran behind'' and could not keep up, Mr. Paquette said.The ice also caused problems for the planes and the equipment that attends to them -- baggage and fuel trucks, for example.''You have difficulty moving just like you would driving a car,'' Mr. Paquette said. ''Everything has to go that much more slowly.''Some planes at Kennedy were de-iced the conventional way, by trucks with hoses that spray the de-icing fluid. But Kennedy also has a de-icing station, a tentlike structure that functions like a jet-size car wash.The de-icing station can handle seven planes an hour in a snowstorm, said William DeCota, the director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but an ice storm increases the time needed to complete the process. Mr. DeCota and passengers on at least one of the stranded flights talked of de-icing times as long as four hours.Compounding the delays, an Alitalia plane broke down while in the de-icing station. The Alitalia jet had to be towed out, and the wait for a tractor to pull the plane held up other planes waiting to go in for de-icing.The planes were filled with tense and increasingly angry passengers, none more so than the Air Maroc jet, which was to have taken off at 7:30 p.m. on Friday. but did not leave the ground until 9:40 p.m. yesterday. They spent a restless night and morning of napping, wandering the aisles and eating what would have been their in-flight meal a few feet above the tarmac.''This has just been an absolute mess,'' said one passenger, Andrew Kolker of Brooklyn. ''They knew they were going to have trouble, it was pretty clear from the weather they were going to have trouble, and they should never have let us get on the plane.''Another passenger, Peter Shinkle, said he had asked to speak with the pilot about midnight. The flight attendants refused, telling him the pilot was busy. At about 6 a.m., he said, ''I began raising a fuss again, and I was permitted to go up in the cabin'' and talk with the pilot and co-pilot.''That's when they told me if we got out of line and went back to the gate, it would take three hours just to go back to the gate,'' he said. ''It's hard to believe, but that's what he said.''After all that, the plane headed back to the gate shortly after 10 a.m. Mr. Paquette, the Terminal 1 official, said the crew had ''timed out,'' meaning that they could no longer be at the controls.Barhoumi Rochdi, an account executive for the airline, said the terminal lacked the manpower and equipment to handle the de-icing in such a severe storm.Once the passengers finally left the plane, the airline told them they could show their boarding passes for free meals at restaurants. Mr. Rochdi said the airline was flying in a larger plane to accommodate the passengers from the Friday flight as well as those with tickets on one scheduled to depart last night.Correction:  March 27, 2007, Tuesday  An article on March 18 about flight delays at John F. Kennedy International Airport caused by a winter storm gave an erroneous name in some copies for an airline whose flight to Zurich was delayed. (The Practical Traveler column in the Travel section on March 18, about ways to cut the cost of flying to Africa, gave another rendering of the name.) It is Swiss International Air Lines, known as Swiss; it is not SwissAir or Swiss Air.

Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island and chief sponsor of the House bill, has criticized as inadequate the Senate bill introduced by his father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Representative Kennedy is trying to mobilize mental health advocates to lobby for what he describes as ''the stronger of the two bills, the House bill.''Both bills seek to end discrimination against people with mental disorders by requiring insurers and employers to provide equivalent coverage, or parity, for mental and physical illnesses.That would be a huge change. For decades, insurers have charged higher co-payments and set stricter limits on coverage of mental health services. For example, insurers often refuse to cover more than 20 visits a year to a psychotherapist. And a patient may have to pay 20 percent of the cost for visiting a cancer specialist, but 40 percent or more for a mental health specialist.The differences between the Kennedys' bills reflect different views about what is possible and what is politically feasible.Senator Kennedy said he was taking a pragmatic approach and had made a number of compromises to win the support of business and insurance groups. These compromises, he said, greatly increased the chances that a bill would become law, protecting millions of Americans in group health plans.Insurers and employers had opposed similar proposals in the past, saying the plans would drive up costs. This year, however, Senator Kennedy invited employers and insurers to help write the legislation, along with mental health groups, and they have endorsed the bill that he introduced with Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. The bill was recently approved in a Senate committee by a vote of 18 to 3.The younger Kennedy approaches the issue with the passion of a man who has been treated for depression and drug dependence. He has advocated parity legislation since 2001, but he said his commitment increased when he became ''the public face of alcoholism and addiction'' last year after a car crash on Capitol Hill.With a new Democratic majority, Congress appears likely to pass some version of the legislation. President Bush has endorsed the principle of mental health parity, though not a specific bill.Nearly 60 percent of all House members have expressed support for the House bill, which provides more protections to patients but is not backed by insurers or employers.''The House bill is everything that we did not like in previous mental health parity bills,'' said E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group.Speaking to mental health advocates this month, Representative Kennedy declared: ''We can't cut any deals with insurance companies. We need to strengthen the Senate bill.''America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents 1,300 insurers, and the American Benefits Council, a trade group mostly of Fortune 500 companies, strongly prefer the Senate version.The American Psychiatric Association supports both bills, describing them as different approaches to the same goal. Mental Health America, an advocacy group for patients, also supports both bills. But Ralph J. Ibson, the chief lobbyist for Mental Health America, said, ''The House bill has greater protections and is therefore a stronger bill.''The House bill is named for Paul Wellstone, the senator from Minnesota who championed similar legislation before he died in a plane crash in 2002. Jeff Blodgett, executive director of Wellstone Action, a nonprofit group that is continuing the Democratic senator's work, said, ''The Senate bill is a step forward, but the House version is true to Paul Wellstone's vision.''On behalf of the senator's sons, David and Mark Wellstone, Mr. Blodgett said, he asked the Senate sponsors not to put the Wellstone name on the Senate bill at this time.One of the biggest differences between the House and Senate bills is that the House version defines the ''minimum scope of coverage.'' Under the House bill, if a group health plan provides any mental health benefits, then it must cover the same wide range of mental illnesses and addiction disorders covered by the health plan with the largest enrollment of federal employees.By contrast, the Senate bill does not specify what mental conditions or diagnoses must be covered.James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, said he liked the Senate bill because it ''does not mandate the specific benefits that a plan must cover.''But Patrick Kennedy said that was a weakness of his father's bill.''Congress is covered, under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, for the treatment of mental illnesses as defined by the medical community,'' Representative Kennedy said in an interview. ''If it's good enough for members of Congress, it should be good enough for the American public. The Senate bill leaves the definition up to whatever is negotiated between the insurer and the employer.''Representative Kennedy said he feared that some insurers would refuse to cover drug and alcohol abuse, eating disorders, or post-traumatic stress disorder.A patient's ability to get treatment at an affordable price often depends on state law. The National Conference of State Legislatures says that 42 states have some type of parity law.The House bill says that federal law will not override ''any state law that provides greater consumer protections, benefits,'' rights or remedies. The Senate bill, by contrast, would ''supersede any provision of state law'' that establishes standards different from the federal standards for cost-sharing and treatment limits.Karen M. Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, praised this provision of the Senate bill, saying it would help ''achieve consistency on how parity is defined'' in different states.But Senators Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, expressed concern that the Senate bill could interfere with laws in their states.Senator Kennedy said he was confident that he and his son could resolve their differences. ''We will find ways of working together,'' he said.</text></article><article id="1834197"><summary>Correction of March 17 article about creation of joint military command for Ivory Coast</summary><text>An article by Reuters on Saturday about the creation of a joint military command for Ivory Coast, a step toward unifying government and rebel forces, incorrectly described the current military situation.

He was 87 and lived in Vienna.Charlotte Schroeder, his American manager, announced his death.Mr. Haefliger was a graceful singer with a flexible, lyrical voice that served him well in recitals -- particularly in Schubert lieder -- and made him an ideal Evangelist in Bach's St. Matthew Passion and St. John Passion, or an eloquent Tamino in Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' He sang most of the Mozart tenor roles, as well the tenor roles in non-operatic scores like Mahler's ''Lied von der Erde,'' Bach's Mass in B minor and the Beethoven Ninth Symphony.Ernst Haefliger (pronounced HEFF-ligger) was born in Davos on July 6, 1919, and studied at the Wettinger Seminary and the Zurich Conservatory before moving to Vienna, where he became a student of the tenor Julius Patzak. At first he focused on the recital and choral repertory, and in 1942, he made his public debut as the Evangelist in Bach's St. John Passion, in Geneva. He also sang in the first performances of several works by the Swiss composer Frank Martin, including ''Le Vin Herb&#233;'' in 1941, ''In Terra Pax'' in 1945, and ''Golgotha'' in 1949.At the urging of the conductor Ferenc Fricsay, with whom he went on to record several Mozart operas and Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' Mr. Haefliger began studying opera as well, and joined the Zurich Opera in 1943.His first important operatic appearance outside Switzerland was as Tiresias in the premiere of Carl Orff's ''Oedipus,'' at the Salzburg Festival in 1949. In 1952, he left the Zurich Opera and joined the St&#228;dische Oper (later the Deutsche Oper), in Berlin, where he remained one of the company's principal lyric tenors until he left the roster in 1974.Mr. Haefliger made his debut at Glyndebourne in 1956, as Tamino, and at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, in the same role, in 1966. In the United States, however, he was heard mainly in recitals and in the Bach Passions. In recent years, he appeared as the Speaker in Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder'' with James Levine and the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in 2001; he sang Schubert's ''Winterreise'' in a recital at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his son the pianist Andreas Haefliger in 1995.Mr. Haefliger taught for many years at the Munich Hochschule f&#252;r Musik and published a book, ''Die Singstimme'' (''The Singing Voice''), in 1983. In 2006, the Ernst Haefliger Competition was established in his honor in Switzerland.In addition to his son Andreas, Mr. Haefliger is survived by his wife of 53 years, Anna Golin Haefliger; another son, Michael Haefliger, who is the artistic and executive director of the Lucerne Festival; and a daughter, Christine Marecek.</text></article><article id="1834490"><summary>Names of eight Americans newly confirmed dead in Iraq; 3,214 American service members have died since start of war</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,214 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

Its rules are so simple they can be explained in two sentences, yet the brainwork needed to solve it is quite complex. Dozens of books on kakuro have been published, and it has been widely promoted as the next big thing after sudoku.Despite its trendy Japanese name, though, kakuro is neither new nor Japanese. Invented by a Canadian building constructor, James E. Funk, it was first published in the United States in 1950 in Official Crossword Puzzles magazine under the name ''cross sums.'' Gradually, cross sums grew in popularity and became a regular feature in Dell puzzle publications. The publisher Nikoli picked it up in the 1980s, renamed it and spurred its international growth.Like sudoku, and crosswords before it, kakuro is a game of filling squares. As human beings, we like to fill up empty spaces, so kakuro strikes an elemental chord.To begin, you commonly start with sums that are either very low or very high for the number of squares. For example, an answer with three squares totaling 7 has to be filled with 1, 2 and 4 in some order. No other combination works. A four-square answer totaling 28 has to be either 4, 7, 8 and 9 or 5, 6, 8 and 9. And if these two answers intersect, the digit at the crossing must be 4, since that is the only digit the possible intersecting answers have in common.The puzzle appeals to people who like complex number play. Unlike sudoku, though, kakuro requires actual math -- specifically, addition. Personally, while I enjoy kakuro, I do not think I could ever become addicted to it because the arithmetic is a little too repetitive and feels too much like schoolwork.For a purely Japanese puzzle that requires no math, I recommend nurikabe, also called islands in the stream. Nikoli introduced it in 1991, causing a sensation.Nurikabe has a few more rules than kakuro or sudoku, but it is easily learned. Filling in the first few squares is usually simple, since any squares orthogonally adjacent to a 1 can be immediately shaded. Also, if a square is situated directly between digits, it can be shaded as well, since no islands can touch each other orthogonally. From there, look for the most constrained parts of the grid (often the corners) and proceed. Work back and forth between the shaded squares and the white ones to finish.Solving a nurikabe builds to a rush of excitement, because the last squares tend to get filled in quickly. This in turn makes you want to do another nurikabe immediately, just as finishing up a sudoku in a hurry makes you want to do another sudoku. Hence the addictiveness of each of these puzzles. I cannot tell you how many times I've said, ''Just one more, then I'll quit.''Nurikabe is particularly suited for electronic or online solving, because it is easier and faster to click squares to change their shading status than to shade them in by hand. But the puzzle works well on paper, too.Masyu, or pearls, is a logic puzzle that Nikoli introduced relatively recently (in 2000), yet it is already a classic. Several books of just masyu have been published. Unusually, it does not involve numbers or letters, just black and white circles in a grid of squares.As in all Japanese logic puzzles, the rules of masyu are short and easily learned. The puzzle uses only a small amount of space. (The grid size varies. I prefer small to medium grids to avoid tedium.) And it can be of any level of difficulty, very easy to very hard.To solve a masyu, start with the circles on the edges of the grid. White pearls have lines passing straight through them. Black pearls have lines turning 90 degrees. A line emanating from a black pearl must go at least one full square before turning. At least one of the two lines emanating from a white pearl must turn immediately. Build from what you know to what you do not know, making sure never to connect two ends of a line until you have completed a single large loop.There are dozens more logic puzzles where these come from. A 2004 Nikoli handbook shows 215 different types, each with helpful examples for readers whose Japanese is a little rusty. These are followed by two or more puzzles to solve. Some of the most popular types are described on Nikoli's Web site, www.nikoli.co.jp/en, with free puzzles to do.Of Nikoli's puzzles I have tried so far, my current favorite is nurikabe, because it is easy to start, but it still packs plenty of challenge. Next week, I may have a different favorite. There are so many types to choose from. We are living in puzzling's golden age right now.Will Shortz is the crossword puzzle editor of The New York Times and the editor of numerous collections of sudoku puzzles for St. Martin's Press.Correction:  April 2, 2007, Monday  An article in Business Day on March 21 about the influx of logic games and brainteasers misstated the role of Nikoli Publishing in the publication of its sudoku books and calendars in the United States.

The reasoning behind the apology movement is straightforward: a great wrong was done for centuries to men and women who contributed in many ways to the prosperity of their country and were willing to die for it in battle; it's long past time to say we're sorry.Resistance to the apology movement is also straightforward. There is the fear that because an apology is an admission of responsibility for a prior bad act, apologizing might establish a legal or quasi-legal basis for reparations. And there is also the objection that after so many years an apology would be merely ceremonial and would therefore be nothing more than a ''feel good'' gesture.But the objection most often voiced is that the wrong people would be apologizing to the wrong people. That was the point made by Tommie Williams, the Georgia Senate majority leader, when he said: ''I personally believe apologies need to come from feelings that I've done wrong,'' and ''I just don't feel like I did something wrong.''Williams's counterpart in the house, Speaker Glenn Richardson, made the same claim of innocence on behalf of his colleagues. ''I'm not sure what we ought to be apologizing for,'' given that ''nobody here was in office.''Mr. Richardson's statement at least has the merit of recognizing that an apology would not be made by an individual -- the idea isn't to go to some slave cemetery and speak to a gravestone -- but by an institution. He just thinks that because no present member of the institution was around at the time of the injury, an apology would make no sense.But this is very bad reasoning, and you can see why if you read just a few recent Supreme Court cases on any subject. Invariably, the justice delivering the court's opinion will cite a precedent from a case decided 50 or 100 years ago, and say something like, ''In Smith v. Jones, we ruled that '' But of course he or she didn't actually -- that is, personally -- rule on anything in 1940 or 1840, so what's with the ''we''?The answer is that by using ''we'' to refer to an action taken before any present member of the court had reached the age of reason or was even alive, the justices acknowledge that they are part of an ongoing enterprise, and as such are responsible for its history; not as individuals, but as persons charged with the duty of carrying on a project that precedes them and will survive them.At times ''carrying on'' includes revising and even repudiating earlier stages in that project. By overruling a precedent -- a rare occurrence, to be sure -- the justices say, collectively and on behalf of everyone who has ever donned the robe, ''Oops, we got that one wrong; sorry, here's another try.''Legislatures do not overrule; they repeal, but the principle is the same. Legislators meeting on the first day of a new term don't say, ''O.K., let's start all over again and figure out what laws we would like to have on the books.'' Instead, they regard themselves as picking up a baton passed to them by their predecessors whose actions they now ''own,'' even in those instances when no legislator now sitting performed them. The vast majority of those actions will continue in force, but a few will be revisited, and of those, a smaller number will be modified or even reversed.Sometimes a mistake now acknowledged can be remedied by changing the law. Sometimes that remedy would come too late, and another form of response is called for, as when the United States passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, deploring the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and authorizing payments of $20,000 to each surviving internee.Ronald Reagan signed that act into law, and two years later President George H. W. Bush formally apologized for ''the wrongs of the past.''Does that mean that Georgia should apologize, too? Not necessarily. The question is a political as well as a moral one, and it is not my intention here to answer it. All I am saying is that while there may be good reasons to resist apologizing, the ''we didn't personally do it and those it was done to are dead'' reason isn't one of them.Guest Columnist Stanley Fish, the Davidson-Kahn professor of law at Florida International University, is a guest columnist this month.</text></article><article id="1834553"><summary>Correction of March 20 article about pet food recall; manufacturer's hotline number is 866-895-2708</summary><text>Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a pet food recall included an erroneous phone number in some copies for a manufacturer hotline.

Mr. Cronin, who lived at the wildlife park, Monkey World, in Dorset, England, was 55.The cause was liver cancer, said his wife, Alison.Mr. Cronin's work with his wife, who holds a doctorate in biological anthropology from Cambridge University, has been credited with focusing international attention on the smuggling of endangered species.Monkey World, the 62-acre park that Mr. Cronin opened and began to cover with shrubbery and trees in 1987, now draws about 500,000 visitors a year. It is regularly featured on the television series ''Monkey Business,'' which appears 14 times a year in about 200 countries on the Discovery Network's Animal Planet channel.Nicholas A. Robinson, a professor of environmental law at Pace University, said yesterday that Mr. Cronin ''created this entire process from scratch and he clearly was among the first in Europe to do it, and one of the first in the world.''''What he was doing,'' Professor Robinson said, ''was taking the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species'' -- a United Nations treaty signed by most countries in 1973 -- ''along with national laws on wildlife and getting them enforced.''Although American citizens -- he was born in Yonkers, she in San Diego -- the Cronins were honored last year by Queen Elizabeth II as Members of the Order of the British Empire, for their services to animal welfare.Starting in 1996, the Cronins made dozens of trips to Africa, Southeast Asia and Turkey -- posing as potential buyers, secretively taking photographs, recording addresses and then leading the local police in raids against animal smugglers. In 1998, for instance, they coordinated simultaneous raids on a pet shop and a street booth at a spice market in Istanbul where baby chimpanzees were being sold.''We were each given police escorts with machine guns,'' Mrs. Cronin said in an telephone interview yesterday. ''Still, the people were drawing their fingers across their throats.''Two chimps that had had their teeth removed and been drugged were taken to wildlife sanctuaries in Turkey.The Cronins have rescued animals from circuses, from laboratories and from use in TV commercials.James Michael Cronin was born Nov. 15, 1951, a son of John and Margaret Battaglia Cronin. His father was a union official.In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, who lives in Yonkers; a daughter, Eleanor, of Plymouth, England; a sister, Debbie Nu&#241;ez of Yonkers; and a brother, John, of Cold Spring, N.Y., the director of the Beacon Institute for Rivers and Estuaries in Beacon, N.Y.Mr. Cronin did not go to college. But as a child he was fascinated by wildlife, voraciously reading books and watching documentaries on the subject.After high school, he began traveling across the United States, working at odd jobs like constructing elevators and doing steel work on bridges. In the late '70s, he got a job as a keeper at the Bronx Zoo.His passion for the animals caught the attention of zoo officials and led to a recommendation that he be hired by John Aspinall, the director of the Howletts Zoo in Kent, England. There, he began working with monkeys and gorillas.''But he had it in the back of his mind that he would have his own wildlife park someday,'' Mrs. Cronin said, ''and that he would create environs that are akin to natural environments.''In 1987, Mr. Cronin received a $35,000 business loan, guaranteed by the British government, and signed a lease for the abandoned pig farm in Dorset. One by one, he began constructing fenced-in two-acre enclosures, filling them with climbing structures made from telephone poles, ropes, mats and fire hoses.Soon after, he heard about baby chimps being used as photographers' props -- drugged and dressed in costumes -- along the beaches of Spain. Working with local animal activists, he approached Spanish authorities and agreed that if the police confiscated the animals, he would provide them with a refuge. Since then, 35 chimpanzees have been taken to Monkey World from Spain.Monkey World is now home to 165 animals, including 59 chimps, 13 orangutans and 18 gibbons as well as woolly monkeys, marmosets, lemurs and capuchin monkeys, and is a tourist attraction that doubles as an education in international wildlife law.Mrs. Cronin, who began working with her future husband in 1990, said they had cooperated with governments in 14 countries to stop the international trade in primates.In 2003, she said, they went to Thailand, where they spotted 115 orangutans in several parks. ''Orangutans only come from two islands, Borneo and Sumatra,'' she said. ''Smugglers would kill the mothers, stuff the babies in baskets and then smuggle them out by small boats.''Within a week, the parks were raided and the animals distributed to sanctuaries in Borneo, where they may eventually be released into the wild.</text></article><article id="1834596"><summary>Adam Sandler fills in for David Letterman on his late night talk show in New York after Letterman contracts stomach virus (S)</summary><text>David Letterman went home sick yesterday afternoon, forcing his CBS program to quickly call in reinforcements from its guest list.

In their primary roles Ms. Joss as Beth Cummings is a 14-year-old from Liverpool who dreams of being an opera singer, and Ms. Robertson is Bess Walder, a 15-year-old Londoner whose yearnings include a visit to Canada and a career in Hollywood. (Both know the film version of ''The Wizard of Oz'' inside out.)In their secondary roles they portray adults like Bess's dad and Beth's mum and various siblings and other people they are destined to encounter.Beth and Bess meet in September 1940 aboard the City of Benares, outward bound under Royal Navy escort in a convoy from Liverpool to Canada. Among its passengers are 90 children sent away for safety's sake. Only 13 are destined to survive the torpedoing.The tale is harrowing and inspiring. Recommended for audiences 8 and older, this 70-minute play, performed without an intermission, has unfamiliar accents, popular music of the past (''Pack Up Your Troubles,'' ''Mairzy Doats,'' ''Don't Fence Me In'') and references to seemingly remote history; it may have moments that do not resonate with the very young.But the play's high adventure and touching lessons in family, fortitude and friendship are conveyed with exceptional theatrical skill, making ''Lifeboat'' an admirable attraction.''Lifeboat'' continues through Sunday at the New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212) 563-2266.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1834674"><summary>Martti Ahtisaari, United Nations envoy to talks on future of Kosovo recommends region be granted independence from Serbia (M)</summary><text>The United Nations envoy to talks on the future of Kosovo, going beyond past statements, has recommended that the region be granted ''independence'' from Serbia.It is ''the only option for a politically stable and economically viable Kosovo,'' the diplomat, Martti Ahtisaari, wrote to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.Mr. Ahtisaari, the United Nations chief negotiator for Kosovo for 13 months, had already recommended that the region be given the main symbols and assets of a sovereign state -- a flag, an army and the right to seek membership in international institutions.But in the past he studiously avoided the word ''independence,'' which United Nations officials considered too inflammatory for Serbia and its allies to be raised in the negotiation process.Mr. Ahtisaari's letter is likely to add more heat to the diplomatic debate in the United Nations Security Council, which is expected to start discussing details of the proposal on Monday.The new language from Mr. Ahtisaari puts pressure on Western nations in the Council to go along with his diplomacy. Russia is opposed to the Ahtisaari plan and called last week for new talks and a new negotiator. It suggested it could veto the proposals as they now stand. Western diplomats say they hope to introduce a resolution this spring on adopting the proposals from Mr. Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland.Yearlong negotiations between leaders of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership and Serbian government officials ended earlier this month with no agreement.The four-page letter from Mr. Ahtisaari argues that the current administration of Kosovo by the United Nations is not sustainable. It excludes the possibility of a return to rule by Serbia, said a United Nations official familiar with the document.''Upon careful consideration of Kosovo's recent history, the realities of Kosovo today, and taking into account the negotiations with the parties, I have come to the conclusion that the only viable option for Kosovo is independence, to be supervised by the international community,'' Mr. Ahtisaari wrote.Extracts of the letter were first published by the French daily Le Monde on Tuesday.Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since June 1999, after a 78-day NATO-led bombing campaign forced the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav security forces to withdraw from the province.Up to 10,000 people, the majority of them ethnic Albanian, are estimated to have been killed in a conflict between ethnic Albanian insurgents and Yugoslav forces between 1997 and 1999. Ethnic Albanians make up the overwhelming majority of Kosovo's residents.Mr. Ahtisaari argued that without full sovereignty, the province, one of the poorest parts of Europe, would be unable to establish closer ties with the European Union, which is seen as one of the main incentives for economic and political change in region.''Unlike many of its Western Balkans neighbors, Kosovo is also unable to participate in any meaningful process toward the European Union -- an otherwise powerful motor for economic development in the region,'' the letter said.</text></article><article id="1834676"><summary>Article on various lenses and their functions for digital cameras; photo (L)i</summary><text>MANY digital photographers are taking the plunge and upgrading to a single-lens reflex camera, in part because the lenses on such cameras are interchangeable. But one trip to a well-stocked camera store might convince some novices that this feature is not so attractive after all.Nikon alone sells 51 different lenses in the United States for its cameras, while Canon has 54 offerings. Still not enough? Several companies, notably Tamron and Sigma, have their own complete lineups of lenses to fit most brand-name cameras.But the bewildering array of lenses is not a marketing trick to promote sales through confusion. It reflects the fact that it is impossible for lens makers to produce a single lens, or even a small number of lenses, to meet every photographic need.''There are always compromises,'' said Steve Heiner, senior technical manager for Nikon USA. ''We're having to deal with basic physics in a lot of ways that put limits on what we can do.''Zoom ImprovementsOne factor has improved the situation for shoppers compared with the predigital days: robots. The image a lens creates is as much a product of its assembly as its design. Robots now make it possible to build inexpensive lenses with a precision that could once be achieved only through minute, and costly, manual adjustments.Better optical design software and the substitution of plastics for brass and aluminum have also helped lenses get cheaper and better. Zoom lenses are no longer poor cousins, optically speaking, to the conventional lenses they replace. ''The development of the zoom lens has been one of the most impressive things I've seen over the last 25 years,'' Mr. Heiner said.Zooms, of course, allow users to change the focal length -- the number that is always expressed in millimeters in a lens's name -- with the twist of a ring. That allows one lens to do the work of many. Most digital cameras come with a zoom lens that is reasonably wide angle at one extreme and moderately telephoto at the other, although the telephoto setting is typically not sufficient for sports or nature photography.Film Lenses vs. DigitalIn the age of the 35-millimeter film camera, the field of view captured by a lens with a focal length of about 50 millimeters was deemed to be roughly the equivalent of that captured by the human eye. Anything above that was a telephoto lens; anything substantially lower was wide angle.But most digital S.L.R.'s have imaging sensors that are smaller than 35-millimeter film, so a lens with a smaller focal length can capture the same subject area. As a result, the new normal, at least for focal lengths, is about 35 millimeters.While advertisements often say a digital camera lens's focal length is ''35-millimeter film equivalent,'' that bit of shorthand is slightly misleading. Certainly the subject area taken in by, say, a 50-millimeter lens when it is used on a Nikon digital S.L.R. is the same as that of a 75-millimeter lens on a Nikon film camera. But the actual focal length affects other properties of the lenses -- which can be both good and bad.Lenses with longer focal lengths generally have a shallower in-focus area than shorter focal-length lenses, which can make it hard to shoot a fast-moving subject. A photographer using a 200-millimeter lens on a digital camera gets the narrow field of view offered by a 300-millimeter telephoto on a film camera, while avoiding the shallower focus of the bigger lens -- as well as its higher cost, larger size and greater weight.But shallow focus, or limited depth of field, can also be a tool for blurring out unfortunate backgrounds and creating a sense of depth. A large maximum opening for the lens (which, counterintuitively, is represented by a small f-stop number, like f1.4) can reduce depth of field. The one big compromise shared by most zooms is that they usually offer relatively modest maximum lens openings of f4 or smaller.Super ZoomsMost lens makers have taken advantage of the smaller digital camera sensors, creating lenses that, in general, are smaller and lighter while sometimes offering zoom ranges that exceed anything ever offered for film. Sigma and Nikon have ''super zoom'' lenses that go from a wide-angle setting of 18 millimeters to a robustly telephoto 200 millimeters, while Tamron offers an 18-250 millimeter model.All three of these lenses can more than cover the focal length needs of most photographers and are remarkably compact. So has the perfect lens finally arrived? Alas, probably not. While Mr. Heiner said he brought an 18-200 millimeter along when he was traveling, he acknowledged that it was optically inferior to other zooms that did not attempt to span such a wide range.Buying a second lens to supplement, rather than replace, the zoom that came in the camera box can result in better quality, and can also be cheaper. This month, Nikon introduced a 55-200 millimeter lens that will sell for $270 but offers features similar to the $750 18-200 super zoom.Another problem with super zooms is their modest light-gathering ability. The Tamron super zoom, for example, has a maximum opening of just f6.3 at its longest focal length setting. Parents hoping to use it to capture the action at an evening soccer match will most likely be disappointed.Canon and Nikon offer several lenses with systems that enlist electronics and moving optics to offset blurring from shaky hands at slow shutter speeds, including Nikon's 18-200 millimeter and its new 55-200 millimeter. (Sony builds its antiblur system into the camera, rather than the lens.)The IndependentsIt is an open secret that companies like Sigma produce lenses under contract to brand-name camera companies. But their own lenses were once viewed as second rate. Most lens tests today show that their products perform about as well as, and in some cases better than, comparable and often more expensive brand-name offerings.The one potential drawback to the outsider lenses is created by the camera makers. Camera companies will not reveal anything about the electronics that link lenses with their cameras' autofocus and exposure systems, forcing the independents to reverse-engineer the answers.As a result, slight model changes in cameras have left independent lenses unusable, or the lenses have caused problems with the cameras' operation. Both Sigma and Tamron have recalled and altered lenses in such cases at no cost to owners. They have also designed lenses to allow for updates to be made with software.Time for PrimesAlthough the zoom lens now reigns, nearly every lens maker still offers fixed focal length, or prime, lenses.''Prime lenses provide the highest optical quality you can get,'' said Chuck Westfall, a technology spokesman for Canon in the United States. ''They are the benchmark.''While optical differences between primes and zooms can sometimes be lost on nonprofessionals, primes do have other benefits. Many have large maximum openings that allow indoor photography without flash, and they can be more compact than a zoom.In some cases, being the ultimate in optics does not come with a correspondingly high price. Mr. Heiner said he often recommended that amateur users supplemented the zoom that came with their camera with a 50-millimeter f1.8 lens, the kind of prime lens that was once shipped with most film cameras. Not only is it one of Nikon's best optical designs, he said, but ''at about $100, it's also our best value.''</text></article><article id="1834685"><summary>Dr Stella Chess, child psychiatrist, dies at age 93; photo (M)</summary><text>Dr. Stella Chess, a child psychiatrist who helped develop and popularize the influential theory that children are born with distinct temperaments that can powerfully affect their outlook and relationship with their parents, died March 14 in Manhattan. She was 93.The cause was pneumonia, her family said.The theory arose from groundbreaking research into human development that began in 1956, when Dr. Chess and her husband, Dr. Alexander Thomas, a former director of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital Center, initiated the New York Longitudinal Study.The study followed 133 children from infancy through adulthood and tried to observe patterns of behavior over that period. Working with two other researchers, Herbert G. Birch and Margaret E. Hertzig, Dr. Chess and Dr. Thomas examined nine dimensions of behavior and concluded that most of their subjects fell into three broad categories.Their findings -- that children could be described as ''easy,'' ''difficult'' or ''slow to warm up'' -- described aspects of an inherent temperament and became critically important when matched with a parent's personality, especially with that of the child's mother. The theory suggests that contrast between the mother's personality and her child's temperament can result in anxiety or behavior problems. Initial results from the study were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1960.Over time, Dr. Chess, who taught at New York University, and her collaborators found that temperament was not necessarily fixed but could change in response to shifts in environment. Further, the researchers concluded that a majority of emotionally traumatized children were not damaged in the longer term and often recovered in therapy.Both findings were received as encouraging news by parents, who read about them in popular books like ''Know Your Child'' (1987) and ''Temperament and Development'' (1977), written by Dr. Chess and Dr. Thomas to bring the fruits of their research to the public eye. Along with Dr. Birch, the two also wrote a practical guide, ''Your Child Is a Person'' (1965).Dr. Theodore Shapiro, a professor emeritus of psychiatry in pediatrics at Cornell, said that through ''dogged research and clinically oriented studies of children,'' Dr. Chess had succeeded in showing that temperament indeed exists and remains, ''as something enduring within every individual.''In other work during the 1960s and '70s, Dr. Chess studied psychiatric disorders in children who had contracted rubella, or German measles, and explored the possibility that the rubella virus was a cause for an autistic syndrome.Stella Chess was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the Ethical Culture School and Smith College. In 1939, she received her medical degree from New York University.Dr. Chess taught at New York Medical College before moving to N.Y.U. as an associate professor of child psychiatry in 1966. She became a professor of child psychiatry there in 1970, and served as director of the university's child and adolescent psychiatric services.Dr. Chess and her husband lived in Manhattan. Her husband died in 2003. She continued to teach at N.Y.U. into her 90s.She is survived by two sons, Kenneth Thomas of Manhattan and Richard Thomas of Yonkers, and by six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</text></article><article id="1834686"><summary>Calvert G DeForest, comedian, dies at age 85; photo (M)</summary><text>Calvert G. DeForest, the dweebish man who gained cult status on David Letterman's late-night shows as the comic figure Larry (Bud) Melman precisely because he was not funny, died Monday in Babylon, Long Island. He was 85.He suffered from a long illness, according to a statement by Mr. Letterman, on whose shows Mr. DeForest appeared dozens of times.For 20 years Mr. DeForest drew laughs simply for being the odd juxtaposition in an industry marked by smooth personalities and slender bodies. His appearances on Mr. Letterman's shows ranged from being a ''correspondent'' at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, to handing out hot towels at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan, to doing bad impersonations of Ronald Reagan, Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley.''Everyone always wondered if Calvert was an actor playing a character, but in reality he was just himself -- a genuine, modest and nice man,'' Mr. Letterman said in his statement.Mr. DeForest's late-blossoming television career began with a New York University student film project called ''King of the Zs,'' which was screened for Mr. Letterman before the 1982 debut of his show, then on NBC. Mr. Letterman, taken by Mr. DeForest, asked his staff members to track him down. They found him working as a file clerk at a drug rehabilitation center. He was picked up by a black limousine, given his stage name, and became the first image of ''Late Night With David Letterman,'' before the opening credits on the debut episode.In 1993, when Mr. Letterman decided to switch to CBS and the show became the ''Late Show With David Letterman,'' Mr. DeForest came along, but his character's name did not. In an intellectual property dispute, NBC claimed ownership of the Larry (Bud) Melman name, even though it had been devised by a ''Letterman'' writer, Merrill Markoe. From the moment his face appeared as the center of the CBS eye logo on the debut CBS show, Mr. DeForest used his own name. He parlayed his ''Letterman'' fame into other film roles and commercials for a wide range of companies including M.C.I., Honda, Cheerios and Pizza Hut. His last appearance on ''Letterman'' celebrated his birthday in 2002.Mr. DeForest was born on July 23, 1921, in Brooklyn to Calvert Martin DeForest, a doctor, and Mabelle Taylor, who briefly worked as an actress. He graduated from Poly Preparatory Country Day School in Brooklyn and always wanted to be an actor. His mother discouraged that ambition, and instead he spent many years working at Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals. When his mother died, he began volunteering for backstage work on local stage productions, which led to performance work in front of the curtain.Mr. DeForest leaves no immediate survivors.</text></article><article id="1834687"><summary>B Franklin Kahn, real estate developer, dies at age 82 (M)</summary><text>B. Franklin Kahn, one of the first developers to recognize that real estate investments could trade much like mutual funds, died March 8 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 82.The cause was congestive heart and kidney failure, said a daughter, Laurie Kahn-Leavitt.Almost 50 years ago, Mr. Kahn, working with Lyndon B. Johnson who was Senate majority leader at the time, helped push through legislation that created real estate investment trusts, or REITs. The law created a vehicle that enabled small investors to buy shares in a trust that held properties that would otherwise be beyond their financial reach.Soon after the law passed in 1960, Mr. Kahn created the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, investing in an amalgamation of office buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings and business parks. He ran it for 27 years, investing in properties that he thought had long-term growth potential, keeping debt low, and applying what he once described as a ''cheapskate's control of operating expenses.'' One result was 27 years of earning increases.Real estate was not Benjamin Franklin Kahn's only passion. He also had a love of language befitting his name. He coined aphorisms (''Conservative principles create principal to conserve'' was a favorite) and wrote silly poetry. He shared Benjamin Franklin's love of tinkering, creating useful items like curved rear-view mirrors for cars. And he cited Franklin as his inspiration when, after he retired in the mid-1990s, he founded the Creativity Foundation to recognize innovators in the arts, humanities, sciences, technology, and public service.Mr. Kahn's eclectic interests surfaced early on. He majored in finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, but also took classes in architecture, history, literature and sociology.Mr. Kahn graduated from Wharton in 1946, and joined the Air Force a few years later. He plunged into the real estate world right after his discharge. He worked for several real estate companies in Washington, and then struck out on his own. Every year, he traveled back to his alma mater to lecture about real estate strategy, and helped create the Wharton Real Estate Center in the 1990s.Joan Freed Kahn, whom Mr. Kahn married in 1951, died in 1997. He is survived by two daughters, Ms. Kahn-Leavitt of Watertown, Mass., and Daryl Kahn Cline of Vancouver, British Columbia; a son, William Kahn of New York City; two grandsons and two granddaughters.</text></article><article id="1834688"><summary>Ann DeChiara Malamud, widow of writer Bernard Malamud, dies at age 89 (S)</summary><text>Ann DeChiara Malamud, whose marriage to Bernard Malamud helped him determine his course as a writer, died on Tuesday in Cambridge, Mass.

He was 67 and lived in Memphis, where the church has its headquarters.The cause was heart failure, his nephew Milton T. Hawkins said.A son of a bishop of the Church of God in Christ, Bishop Patterson was elected leader of the denomination in 2000. Known for his vivid sermons, Bishop Patterson spread the Pentecostal word through regular Sunday services broadcast on the Word Network, the Trinity Broadcasting Network and Black Entertainment Television. His own congregation, Temple of Deliverance, which he founded in 1975, had more than 6,000 active members in 2000.At a 2005 church convention in Memphis, the bishop called on his membership to spread the faith beyond racial and cultural differences. ''I don't know why we ever got stuck on that thing that we're only supposed to give witness to black folks,'' he said.Pentecostalism, one of the fastest-growing evangelical movements, teaches that people can be filled with the Holy Ghost in a second baptism. Most Pentecostals also believe that speaking in tongues -- in inspired unintelligible utterances -- links believers to God and brings the word of God to other people.The Church of God in Christ has about six million members. The second-largest denomination in the black American Pentecostal movement, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, has about three million members.Gilbert Earl Patterson was born in Humboldt, Tenn., on Sept. 22, 1939, a son of Mary Louise and William A. Patterson. His father led churches in Memphis and later in Detroit.Ordained as a church elder in Detroit in 1957, Bishop Patterson attended LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis and the Detroit Bible Institute. In 1975, he founded Temple of Deliverance. After he was elected bishop, he started Cogic Charities, which has raised more than $1 million to aid victims of disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. He was also editor and publisher of Bountiful Blessings Magazine, which has 100,000 subscribers.Bishop Patterson is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Louise Dowdy; and three daughters, Mary Hawkins and Lee Ella Smith, both of Memphis, and Barbara Davis of Detroit.Correction:  March 23, 2007, Friday  An obituary yesterday about G.

Tolkien enthusiasts since the ''Lord of the Rings'' films put his fantasy world of Middle-earth on screen, Tolkien's most avid admirers still risk being labeled geeks. But wearing elf ears or not, they are a force to be reckoned with.''The Lord of the Rings'' has sold 200 million copies in 39 languages. The movies based on the novel broke box-office records. And while Tolkien, the Oxford don who created ''Rings,'' ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion,'' died in 1973, this year will be another big one for him.The first ''new'' work by Tolkien in 30 years arrives in bookstores on April 17. The book, ''The Children of H&#250;rin,'' is an incomplete manuscript edited by Tolkien's son Christopher. And the release of a multiplayer Internet game, ''The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar,'' is set for April 24.Naturally, the Tolkien faithful organize Tolkien-themed events. Game players, medievalists, linguists and other scholars all have reasons to become lost in the heroic fantasy of ''Rings'' and can find gatherings to match their sensibilities.At the most rarefied level, Tolkienism is a field of academic study, and conference participants leave their fur-tufted Hobbit feet behind. Tolkien's vast created world of invented languages, legends, maps, poetry and creatures invites explication -- and debate.The Tolkien Conference at the University of Vermont in mid-April will offer a keynote speaker, the presentation of papers, a reading and films. ''A geek fest,'' said Chris Vaccaro, the conference co-founder and an adjunct lecturer at the university.The undergraduate Elvish Club will put on a 10-minute performance entirely in Elvish, a language developed by Tolkien.In May, the long-running annual International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University will include a number of sessions devoted to Tolkien on topics like gender and ethnicity in the books. ''In the hands of a knowledgeable instructor,'' Paul E. Szarmach, director of the university's Medieval Institute, said in an e-mail interview from London, ''Tolkien's work can be the text that opens the medieval world.'' Reading ''Rings'' or ''The Silmarillion,'' has inadvertently converted more than one fan of Orlando Bloom, the actor who played the Elvish character Legolas, into an admirer of ''Beowulf,'' which inspired Tolkien.Two summer events appeal to both amateur scholars and budding actors.''I'm an obsessed geek,'' said Marie Miesel, a nurse from Nashville and a presenter at Dragon*Con, perhaps the nation's largest convention for fantasy fans, held in Atlanta annually on Labor Day weekend. ''My parents brought me to science fiction conventions when I was 7.'' She will be leading a seminar on Sept. 2, ''The Silmarillion for Dummies.''The four-day convention isn't just about Tolkien, but its Tolkien Track will be a cluster of lectures, game demonstrations, films and panel discussions on topics from ''Customizing Your Action Figures'' to ''Misconceptions of Copyright Law for the Creator of Fan Works.'' A party called An Evening in Bree (Bree is a village in Middle-earth) will include folk dancing, a trivia contest and a band singing Tolkien-themed lyrics. On Saturday morning, hundreds of costumed Tolkien fans will march through downtown Atlanta -- bearded wizards and snarling orcs -- mingling with Klingons (''Star Trek'') and Imperial Guardsmen (''Star Wars'') from other fantasy-loving groups.''We have no objection to those things, but we are interested in the books,'' said David Bratman, chairman of Mythcon 38 (this year, Aug. 3 to 6 in Berkeley, Calif.). Largely presentations of 40 scholarly papers, this smaller event is run by the Mythopoeic Society, an organization devoted to studying Tolkien and others in the circle called the Inklings, which also included C. S. Lewis and Charles Williams. But even the staid Mythcon has its whimsical side: the Not Ready for Mythcon Players -- ''half-rehearsed performances,'' Mr. Bratman said, ''of some sort of silly adaptation.''To be closer to the source of the myths that inspired Tolkien, fans can journey to England for the British Tolkien Society's Tolkien Weekend in May. A grassy lawn at Sarehole Mill in Birmingham, where Tolkien spent his formative years, is the staging ground for activities like dramatizations of ''The Hobbit,'' calligraphy, storytelling, folk singing and Viking battle re-enactments. With about 10,000 visitors each year, the weekend suggests that Tolkien has finally moved beyond geeks.DETAILSBURLINGTON, Vt.

It somehow manages to blend the kitsch of a Disney-like ski resort, the elegance of a small cosmopolitan city and the serenity of fir-and-pine-covered mountains.''It's fabulous,'' said David Lyons, an investor and developer who divides his time between Mont Tremblant and Montreal. ''I've got all the good of a city, but I'm in the country.''He and his wife, Sandra, are building a three-bedroom, 3,300-square-foot house on Lac Forget on six acres they bought in 1998 for 30,000 Canadian dollars (about $25,400 at the current rate of 1.18 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar). They stay, meanwhile, at the Ch&#226;teau Beauvallon, a hotel where they own a suite.The town is made up of three villages: the Mont Tremblant resort pedestrian village, which overflows with restaurants, bars and shops that sell skiwear and chocolates; the original village of Mont Tremblant, known as the vieux, or old, village; and St.-Jovite, a service-oriented town recently incorporated into Mont Tremblant.Second-home owners are drawn by the ski resort, which Intrawest bought in 1991 and expanded, adding a gondola, new lifts, improved snowmaking and the pedestrian village. The company plans to invest an additional billion Canadian dollars in the resort in the next decade, creating two additional villages, Versant Soleil and Versant Nord. Versant Soleil will include a conference center, a hotel and 1,200 housing units ranging from studio hotel rooms to luxury homes.With the recent renovation of Mont Tremblant International Airport, 24 miles north of town, the region attracts a ''private jet-set'' crowd that includes Formula One racecar drivers and professional hockey players, said Michael Clark, a broker and developer with Mont Tremblant Real Estate. He said about half the buyers are from Britain.Hollywood celebrities have also been seen, with Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones building a house in the area, according to real estate agents and tourism officials.Celebrity residents aside, though, Mont Tremblant isn't overly glamorous. Along the two-lane roads that connect the three villages you see more yellow caution signs for deer than you do Land Rovers or Hummers. In St.-Jovite, where the peal of the bell at St.-Jovite Church can stall conversation, there are antique shops, cafes, supermarkets and a hardware store, complemented by new shops and restaurants -- including an Irish pub that is scheduled to open soon.The SceneJanuary and February temperatures in Mont Tremblant often fall into the single digits (Fahrenheit), so fur is functional as well as fashionable. One recent Saturday morning, a half-dozen mink-swaddled, middle-aged women crowded into a cafe in St.-Jovite. Across town, powder-hounds headed straight to ''the station,'' as the ski lift is called, to take advantage of the abundance of snow that had recently fallen.At 2,870 feet, the mountain is a major draw, but skiing isn't the only winter pursuit. Over at the oval on Lac Moore, stroller-pushing mothers skate alongside adolescent speed skaters. Some mountainside developments have their own skating ponds, and people cross-country ski or snowshoe along the 20-mile bike path that connects the three villages or on the P'tit Train du Nord, a former rail line that stretches through Quebec.After a day of play, second-home owners often convene for happy hour in the pedestrian village before heading home for dinner. While Le P'tit Caribou attracts a younger crowd, there's a decidedly older, though no less rowdy, gathering at Le Shack, where white-maned skiers and flannel-clad hotel developers drink pints and shout to be heard over live rock 'n' roll.Mont Tremblant ''is the center of our social life,'' said Mr. Lyons, who has befriended other seasonal buyers from Ottawa and Montreal. ''Every Saturday we go to somebody's house for dinner.''ProsFor American buyers, the exchange rate helps make Canada affordable. ''We found the exchange rate appealing,'' said Kelli Christensen, who owns a three-bedroom ski-in, ski-out mountainside condo with her fianc&#233;, Mike Mika, an electrical contractor. The couple, who live in Naples, Fla., bought their condo for 390,000 Canadian dollars in 2005.Second-home owners rave about the region's activities. In addition to biking and hiking, there are six golf courses in town. Circuit Mont Tremblant, an auto racing track that has been host to Formula One championships, sponsors car events that last year included a Ferrari Festival.''The kids thought that was cool,'' Ms. Christensen said. She and Mr. Mika have three boys, ages 9, 10 and 11, who also enjoy the luge track that is built into the mountainside in summer and the indoor aquatic park in the pedestrian village.The ski resort abuts the 373,000-acre Mont Tremblant National Park, which is popular for hiking and camping. Devil's River ropes through town and residents canoe and raft there and swim and water-ski on the 900 lakes that pepper the region.Within an hour's ride on a float plane, Mr. Lyons said, ''you can be in untouched wilderness.''Cons''It's too bad the mountain isn't 2,000 or 3,000 feet higher,'' Mr. Lyons said. While Mont Tremblant is ideal for families, it's not considered challenging.The time and expense of getting to Mont Tremblant can be substantial. Ms. Christensen says that the time and expense of travel are ''a downer.'' The family usually flies into Montreal from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a $2,500 investment in airfare each visit.Isabella and Brian Allendorfer make the 15-hour drive from Chicago with their two children, ages 5 and 3, at least four times a year. The couple bought a three-bedroom, ski-in, ski-out property just minutes from the pedestrian village for 419,000 Canadian dollars last July.''We couldn't touch anything like that in the U.S.,'' Mrs. Allendorfer said.The Real Estate MarketMost seasonal buyers want property on or near the mountain, said Herb Ratsch, a broker with Playground Real Estate, a division of Intrawest. Mountainside town houses range from 1.1 million to 1.4 million Canadian dollars, while a two-bedroom condo in the pedestrian village can be bought for less than 300,000 Canadian dollars. Off the mountain, a typical midrange property is a four-bedroom house on one acre that lists for 500,000 to 700,000 Canadian dollars.Land is more plentiful than homes, with private communities the rage. ''The 10-kilometer perimeter of the mountain is on fire,'' Mr. Clark said. On Lake Desmarais, developers have carved out 100 acres for a private community that will eventually include hiking trails and a tennis club.Two years ago, a two-to-three-acre lot on Lake Desmarais sold for 225,000 Canadian dollars, Mr. Clark said. Similar-size lots today sell for 1 million Canadian dollars. Three-acre lots in Sommets-du-Lac, a new community within walking distance of the H&#244;tel Quintessence, also sell for 1 million Canadian dollars.''Everything sells out here before it's in the ground,'' Mr. Ratsch said, including 24 half-acre lots in the Soleil village that listed for 500,000 to 700,000 Canadian dollars.Property has been appreciating handsomely in the last two years, with land values skyrocketing. A 1.5-acre lot in the Belvedere subdivision that Mr. Lyons bought in 2003 for 90,000 Canadian dollars is now worth 275,000 Canadian dollars, he said. Million-dollar properties ''were unheard of two or three years ago,'' he said. ''Now they are quite standard.''LAY OF THE LANDPOPULATION -- 8,735, according to town officials.SIZE -- About 100 square miles.WHO'S BUYING -- Britons, young families from Montreal and Ottawa, professional hockey players, celebrities, soon-to-be-retired Americans.GETTING THERE -- Direct flights to Montreal are available from all three major airports in the New York City area, Miami, Chicago and other United States cities.

The characters in his most memorable films are men who live in a permanent, irrational state of war with themselves, with the rest of humanity, with the wild inscrutability of the natural world. They are loners, conquerors, obsessives. In his recent documentaries, notably ''Grizzly Man'' and ''The White Diamond,'' Mr. Herzog observes them with rueful philosophical detachment. There was a time, though, when the grandeur and ferocity of his cinematic ambition marked him as a kindred spirit.Nowhere is this more apparent than in the films he made starring Klaus Kinski, an actor who has been called many things (not least by Mr. Herzog himself) but never mild-mannered. ''Aguirre: The Wrath of God'' (1972) is the most celebrated of these, and ''Fitzcarraldo'' (1982) has a certain notoriety, in part because of ''Burden of Dreams,'' Les Blank's fascinating, appalling documentary about its making. But ''Cobra Verde,'' completed in 1987, was the project that pushed the always volatile relationship between Mr. Herzog and Mr. Kinski (memorialized in Mr. Herzog's 1999 documentary ''My Best Fiend'') to the brink of homicide, and for some reason it has never been released in this country. Connoisseurs of craziness need wait no longer. ''Cobra Verde'' opens today in all its feral, baffling glory.Along with ''Aguirre'' and ''Fitzcarraldo,'' ''Cobra Verde'' completes a trilogy of mayhem and megalomania in hot climates. Mr. Kinski is the title character, a Brazilian rancher, originally known as Francisco Manoel da Silva, who turns to banditry after being driven from his land by drought and famine. A solitary, vengeful figure, filmed like the debauched cousin of a Sergio Leone spaghetti-western hero, da Silva roams the dusty 19th-century backlands, shooting, drinking and womanizing. Eventually he is hired as an overseer by a soft, decadent sugar planter, but he runs into trouble when his employer's three daughters wind up pregnant with little Cobras. The local bigwigs ship da Silva off to Africa to administer the faltering slave trade, assuming he won't come back alive. At that point things start to get really strange.Based on a novel by Bruce Chatwin, ''Cobra Verde'' has some of the political feverishness of Gillo Pontecorvo's ''Burn!,'' in which Marlon Brando played an 19th-century British adventurer messing around in a Caribbean slave revolt. Mr. Pontecorvo used melodrama as a mode of historical analysis, but Mr. Herzog does the opposite. The cynical power games and brutal economics of the slave trade are part of the story he tells, though not really its point. After a while the story itself fades into the background, overwhelmed by Mr. Herzog's intoxicating, intoxicated sense of spectacle.It is tempting to say that, in his African and South American adventures, Mr. Herzog, born in Munich and educated, among other places, in Pittsburgh, succumbed to the lure of the tropics and went native. But that would be to underestimate both the extremity and the integrity of his films, in which he sets out to show that he, and by extension the part of the world that fancies itself civilized, is far more savage than any Amazonian or African tribe. The Africans in ''Cobra Verde'' are hardly the noble, natural men of Western romance; they are as mad and capricious as da Silva himself.Watching ''Cobra Verde,'' you feel at times that Mr. Herzog, like a figure out of Joseph Conrad, is in danger of losing his way, or even his mind. His eye, however, never deserts him, and the final third of this film contains sequences of horrifying sublimity and ethereal beauty, moments that have a clarity and power beyond the reach of reason.Cobra Verde  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Werner Herzog; written (in German, with English subtitles) by Mr. Herzog, based on the novel ''The Viceroy of Ouidah'' by Bruce Chatwin; director of photography, Viktor Ruzicka; edited by Maximiliane Mainka; music by Popol Vuh; production designer, Ulrich Bergfelder; produced by Lucki Stipetic; released by 518 Media, Inc.

Did I mention the exploding heads? It is an admittedly primitive pleasure, but I do love watching stuff blow up in movies (heads, not so much). There is something unaccountably gratifying, at times reassuring about watching the screen -- the bigger the better -- become engulfed by surging waves of liquid orange, in the image of a car exploding into the air like a rocket, in a room, a building, a boat, a truck, you name it, shattering into confetti.The late 1980s and 1990s were good times for big movie bangs and bulging movie muscle. It was the golden age of bad boys and Boy Scouts, wisecracks and careless, loving, hardcore American violence. Sept. 11 may have dampened our appetite for destruction, and I know that I squirmed uncomfortably while watching ''Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,'' a cheap 2002 action film with too many falling bodies. But the violence returned with a vengeance soon after the attack and now signs of war are everywhere on the big screen, in the torture scenes that seem increasingly de rigueur whether it's James Bond or a tourist strapped to a chair, in foreign affairs and exotic adventures and, yes, even inside the sightlines of ''Shooter.''The story has the simplicity of a fairy tale: A former military sniper, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), having opted out of the Marines after an unfortunate escapade abroad, has retreated into the deep woods with his dog and his guns. An updated, upgraded Jeremiah Johnson, with a garden full of vegetables and a fridge stocked with beer, Swagger comes across as something of a Zen mountain man. He lives simply (but has a computer) and dresses plainly (but wears a trendsetter's beard). He seems at peace in this world as he sits on a crest overlooking the forest. Yet the world is not at peace, as we know from the first few minutes of the film set someplace dusty and scary and far, far away.Guns must be raised, and that beard really has to come off. And so they do and so it does, as Swagger comes down off his mountain and drops into an assassination intrigue stocked with villainy and weapons. There are black helicopters, a spunky redhead (Kate Mara) and a shootout boldly painted in red, white and blue. The redhead looks good in a miniskirt and twirls a rifle as lightly as a baton; mostly she ogles Mr. Wahlberg, who, once he shaves his beard, provides ample opportunity for eyeball strain. A natural screen presence, Mr. Wahlberg is charmingly sincere (he's like a cruder, more street Matt Damon), though when he sheds his clothes the glint in his eyes is as knowing as that of an old Vegas stripper.Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Jonathan Lemkin, ''Shooter'' is based on the novel ''Point of Impact'' by Stephen Hunter, who, when not turning out pulp fictions, works as a film critic for The Washington Post. Mr. Fuqua, the auteur of such rococo diversions as ''Training Day'' and ''Tears of the Sun,'' likes to keep the volume cranked and the action relentless. Like many contemporary action directors, he overshoots and overedits, cramming his films with inexplicable, unnecessary visual and aural noise. This maximalist approach can tax the nerves, though it has the benefit of keeping you on alert. It's also pretty enjoyable. Mr. Fuqua, who happens to be surprisingly good with actors, does have a knack for chaos.Here that disorder extends to the story, which combines a live-free-or-die vibe with some deep-fried gun-and-flag fetishism for the usual love-it-or-leave-it, lock-and-load, make-my-day Hollywood jumble. Bob Lee Swagger's name is obviously meant to evoke Lee Harvey Oswald, much like the image of a rifle pointed in the direction of an American president. But it's tough to figure out how these historically saturated allusions to the Kennedy assassination fit with the angry talk about Congress. In the end all we know about Bob Lee Swagger is that, like the adorable F.B.I. agent (Michael Pe&#241;a) hot and cold on his trail, he is a good man. Which is perhaps all that we are ever meant to know when an American holds a gun.''Shooter'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Did I mention the exploding heads?Shooter  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Antoine Fuqua; written by Jonathan Lemkin, based on the novel ''Point of Impact'' by Stephen Hunter; director of photography, Peter Menzies Jr.; edited by Conrad Buff and Eric Sears; music by Mark Mancina; production designer, Dennis Washington; produced by Lorenzo Bonaventura and Ric Kidney; released by Paramount Pictures.

Like the investment banker being played by Chris Rock on a nearby screen at the multiplex (in ''I Think I Love My Wife''), Alan is not so much unhappy as bored by his own contentment.The character may be a bit of a clich&#233;, but the performance is typical of Mr. Cheadle, which is to say flawlessly understated and intensely interesting. Behind Alan's unruffled, buttoned-up facade -- the smiles of professional courtesy and domestic agreeableness -- lie barbs of hostility and humor that pop out to keep you alert and off balance.Alan is one half of the movie's buddy-picture pairing. The other is Charlie Fineman, Alan's former college roommate, who is played by Adam Sandler. Mr. Sandler's performance is by no means understated, but neither is it typical. Rather it is the kind of role that tries to force you to see a familiar performer in a radical new light. Mr. Sandler has ventured outside his big-baby persona before, notably in ''Spanglish'' and in ''50 First Dates,'' but this is the first time he has shouldered so much dramatic weight.And the burden is about as heavy as they come. Charlie, once a successful dentist like Alan, came undone when his wife and three daughters died on board one of the 9/11 planes. The writer and director of the film, Mike Binder, does not withhold this information, but he does approach it coyly, allowing his characters to speak about the attacks in allusions and euphemisms most of the time.Charlie himself is in a state far beyond denial. In his grief he has regressed into a kind of shaggy preadolescence -- which makes him, come to think of it, a version of the standard Sandler character after all. Charlie zips around Manhattan on a motorized scooter and retreats into a world of video games, compulsive late-night kitchen renovation and classic rock, which he listens to on headphones he wears like a protective helmet. Though his unkempt hair shows signs of graying, his diction is childlike, and his emotional weather resembles that of a toddler: the pursuit of endless gratification punctuated by occasional tantrums.Like ''The Upside of Anger,'' in which Mr. Binder benefited from fine work by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner, ''Reign Over Me'' uses the rhythms and moods of comedy to explore, and also to contain, overpowering feelings of loss, anger and hurt. And like that earlier movie, this one is maddeningly uneven.It's rare to see so many moments of grace followed by so many stumbles and fumbles, or to see intelligence and discretion undone so thoroughly by glibness and grossness. And it is puzzling, and ultimately draining, to see a film that waves the flag of honesty -- Face your demons! Speak from your heart! Open up! -- turn out to be so phony.The best scenes are those that give Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Sandler room to play against each other, to bring their very different temperaments into a workable syncopation. The premise of their relationship is fairly schematic. Alan, who resumes his friendship with Charlie after years of being out of touch, tries to coax his old pal back into contact with the world around him, while Charlie's life of compulsive play allows Alan a furlough from his confining responsibility. The two actors perform the dance of superego and id with impressive ease and suavity.But Mr. Binder strews their path with obstacles. A subplot involving Saffron Burrows as a would-be patient who propositions Alan in his office seems like a leftover from ''The Mind of the Married Man,'' Mr. Binder's dreadful HBO series. Another, with Liv Tyler as a therapist, is superfluous and wearisome. Worse, as Mr. Sandler moves from mumbling repression of Charlie's pain to tearful expression of it (with songs by Bruce Springsteen and the Who punching hard on the audience's emotional buttons) this director's approach to the 9/11 theme starts to feel crude and exploitative.A recitation of the events of that day, especially coming after a series of lovingly shot Manhattan streetscapes, can't fail to tighten throats and moisten eyes. But that makes the big therapeutic payoffs at the end feel easy and unearned.By that point you may feel used as well as used up. The delicate insights toward which ''Reign Over Me'' at first seems headed, and the psychological subtlety of much of the acting, are squandered in revelations and confrontations that belong in a made-for-TV weepie. Mr. Binder can be a smart writer and a fluent director, but he can't quite keep his dumb ideas from getting in the way of his good ones. He's a bit like Charlie without Alan, spinning his wheels and lost in his own head.''Reign Over Me'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual references.Reign Over Me  Opens today nationwide.Written and directed by Mike Binder; director of photography, Russ Alsobrook; edited by Steve Edwards and Jeremy Roush; music by Rolfe Kent; production designer, Pipo Wintter; produced by Jack Binder and Michael Rotenberg; released by Columbia Pictures.

The setting, most of the time, is a stadium in Tehran, where the Iranian national soccer team is facing Bahrain in a qualifying match for the World Cup. We hear the cheers and groans of the crowd and some improvised play-by-play from a few spectators, but like the film's main characters -- die-hard supporters of the team, some of them adorned with face paint in the red, white and green of the Iranian flag -- we never see what is happening on the field.Those unlucky fans are young women, whose attempts to see the match live are stymied by the police and by strict rules forbidding the mixing of the sexes. Trying to pass for boys, a half-dozen of them have been rounded up and confined to a makeshift holding pen on a ramp outside the stadium walls. The young soldiers who are their captors seem to be just as confused and demoralized as the women themselves, and the film's rich, pointed comedy arises from the sense that all of them, men and women alike, are trapped in an absurd, insoluble predicament.Which is not to say that they suffer equally. In a previous film, ''The Circle'' -- one of the best works of cinema to come out of Iran in the past decade -- Mr. Panahi followed a collection of women through the streets of Tehran as they tried to evade arrest, family violence and other forms of injustice. That film painted an unsparing, unsentimental picture of the way laws and social customs are often arbitrarily and harshly enforced in Iran.While the gist of ''Offside'' is the same, its tone is more insouciant, as it celebrates the guile and toughness of its heroines while casting a sympathetic glance at the ethical quandaries facing their jailers. The men want to do their jobs, to follow the rules, and in a few cases to protect the virtue of their captives from what they perceive as a risk of dishonor, but mostly they want peace and quiet and a chance to sneak a glance at the soccer field to see how their team is doing.Instead they find themselves mired in an endless series of quarrels and negotiations. Perhaps because of censorship that limits what can be shown, Iranian movies are often propelled by argument, which Mr. Panahi's restless camera turns into its own kind of action. An inspired piece of farce unfolds when one of the girls announces that she has to use the bathroom in a stadium that only has facilities for men. But the lightheartedness is often shadowed by the threat of real trouble, since even the lighthearted breaking of a silly rule can have serious consequences. (It also turns out that one of the women has gone to the game for reasons far more grave than fandom.)Part of the film's risky, transgressive energy arises from the circumstances of its making. Denied official permission to shoot ''Offside,'' Mr. Panahi went ahead under the pretext of making another, less provocative film. And he concludes with a remarkably exuberant sequence that doubles as a celebration of his own sneaky success. It's not giving anything away to divulge that at the end Iran wins the game, since ''Offside'' has already made clear that such a victory, like the outcome of any other sporting event, is unlikely to really change anything.''Offside'' is rated PG. It has some strong language.Offside  Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.Produced, directed and edited by Jafar Panahi; written (in Persian, with English subtitles) by Mr. Panahi and Shadmehr Rastin; director of photography, Mahmood Kalari; set designer, Iraj Raminfar; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

It is a war that can seem without answer or end and that, as we enter the fifth year this week, may become among the most documented in history. There are soldier stories, lyrical meditations and wonky exegeses, propagandistic screeds, gonzo entertainments and stirring testimonials. ''The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair'' belongs squarely in the first-person subgenre, though its heat-seeking title suggests its makers yearn for something bigger and grander.The subject of the movie's title is an Iraqi journalist named Yunis Khatayer Abbas, who in 2003 was roused from his bed in his family's Baghdad home by American soldiers. An American, Michael Tucker, who was tagging along with the soldiers, caught the arrest on video. He later folded images of this angry Iraqi mouthing off to the soldiers -- and to the camera -- into his 2005 documentary, ''Gunner Palace.'' Nominally nonpolitical and nonpartisan, that documentary affords a close-up view of young American soldiers camped out in Uday Hussein's former palace. Like anyone from the MySpace Generation, the soldiers are as comfortable playing to the camera as to one another, and just as self-aware. ''We live in this movie,'' says one.True, but the Americans in ''Gunner Palace'' are also living in a real country called Iraq filled with real people struggling through unimaginable horror. Intentionally or not, ''The Prisoner,'' which was directed by Mr. Tucker and his wife, Petra Epperlein, addresses the earlier movie's myopic point of view because this time out it's an Iraqi who dominates the camera, not an American. Mr. Abbas lives in this movie, and ''The Prisoner'' belongs to him. As he shares his anguish, his outrage, his fear, his despair, his hope, his Iraq, it becomes clear that the Americans -- the soldiers, the filmmakers and those of us sitting comfortably in our theater seats watching him -- are just witnesses to what feels like a crime.''The Prisoner'' is, in essence, a captivity story told through talking-head interviews woven together with newsy-looking video images, fragments of home movies, still photographs, bits of text and comic-book-like illustrations. The main talking head belongs to Mr. Abbas, who narrates while seated in a room before a camera and its unseen operator(s). He wears glasses and looks well dressed; his neat hair and goatee are flecked with gray. For the most part he speaks in accented English with somewhat bumpy syntax. On occasion bleats of traffic pierce the hushed ambient noise. It's initially unclear where we are -- the Green Zone in Baghdad, a hotel room in Washington -- but the depressing story that Mr. Abbas tells of his arrest and what happened next largely brings us into Abu Ghraib.And it is a depressing story, certainly, as well as moving, confusing and, at a fast 72 minutes, at once undercooked and overpadded. Ms. Epperlein's bold, blocky illustrations, which are used to convey what happened inside the prison, provide visual punch, but they also give the story the dubious flavor of a boy's own adventure. To relate too many other details would be to give away, as it were, the drama and cliffhangers, heroes and villains. Mr. Tucker and Ms. Epperlein assume that the audience doesn't need a geopolitical primer, the reasons and rationales for the war. Instead they keep a tight focus on the arrest and its nominal cause (the full title gives it away) and what happened after Mr. Tucker noticed one Iraqi brought to his knees by war.''The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some rough language.The Prisoner  Or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair  Opens today in Austin, Tex.; Cambridge, Mass.; Chicago; Los Angeles; New York; San Francisco; and Washington.Written, produced and directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein; director of photography, Mr. Tucker; edited by Mr. Tucker; released by Truly Indie.

Are our individual fates sealed, or can we alter them by changing our behavior? In trying to shape our destinies, are we just bringing them on? Is knowing the future a blessing because it allows us to plan ahead and make amends, or a curse that can't be shaken?''First Snow,'' the directorial debut of Mark Fergus, filters such questions through the unlikable character of Jimmy Starks (Guy Pearce), a shifty, sharp-shooting flooring salesman based near Albuquerque whose desperate edge recalls Mr. Pearce's memory-challenged character in ''Memento.'' In his latest scheme to hit the jackpot, he is raising money to buy up a cache of vintage Wurlitzer jukeboxes and sell them to bars around the country.Putting the kind of fast-talking salesman who would be at home in a David Mamet play through the existential wringer suggests that ''First Snow'' is an examination of the all-American karma of greed and the self-made man, but it's only partly that. A noirish thriller that revels in ominous visual moods, deepened by Cliff Martinez's spare, shivering guitar score, this heartland ''Appointment in Samarra'' is a mind-teaser that speaks the flat, evasive language of its seedy characters. Mr. Fergus and his screenwriting collaborator Hawk Ostby belonged to the writing team on ''Children of Men.'' They may not have Mr. Mamet's acute ear, but their dialogue captures the vacant cheery tone of salesmen on the make.Gaunt, rat-eyed and sweaty, with greasy, shoulder-length hair, Jimmy lives with his girlfriend, Deirdre (Piper Perabo), in desert high country dotted with ugly fake-adobe houses. At the beginning of the movie, he fires his prot&#233;g&#233;, Andy (Rick Gonzalez), for skimming money off the top, even though it was something Jimmy had taught him how to do. Jimmy also balks at moving to Taos with Deirdre (an underwritten role) to live a more settled existence.One afternoon while waiting at a depot for his car to be repaired, Jimmy notices a trailer with a sign offering $10 fortunetelling and decides to plunk down the cash. When he asks Vacaro (J. K. Simmons), the grizzled, hangdog-eyed seer, to predict the outcome of a basketball game, he is assured that the New Mexico Wolves will win -- unlikely, since the team's star player has been injured. Vacaro also tells him that a windfall will arrive by way of Dallas, but Jimmy knows no one there.Suddenly Vacaro goes into a seizure. When he recovers, he insists that Jimmy take back his money. Jimmy dismisses the incident until the Wolves pull off a surprise victory, and he learns of unexpected backing for the jukebox enterprise from a source in Dallas.Shaken, Jimmy returns to the trailer, points a gun at Vacaro's head and demands to know the vision that produced the seizure.After a pause, Vacaro says wearily: ''I saw no more roads, no more tomorrows. But you're safe until the first snow.''Jimmy begins to come apart. Winter is approaching, and the radio warns of a blizzard. The landscape is charged with a sullen foreboding. Threatening drawings arrive in the mail, along with eerie, static-filled phone messages that suggest that Jimmy is being stalked.He decides that Andy is out to get him. Or could it be Vince, his best childhood buddy, who was recently discharged from prison after serving three years for a money-laundering scheme concocted by the two of them? Jimmy had betrayed his friend to avoid going to prison.As Jimmy, besieged by paranoia and guilt, desperately pursues answers, you half expect the movie to take a turn into horror, but it remains on its circular track inside his tormented mind. When it turns a little soft, you wonder if it will tumble into mawkish ''Touched by an Angel'' territory, but it remains dry-eyed.The story slowly builds to a pained reunion of Jimmy and Vince, whose life is now in shambles.Finally, when the first real snow begins to fall, it's almost a relief. For better or for worse, this is it.''First Snow'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and violence.First Snow  Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Mark Fergus; written by Mr. Fergus and Hawk Ostby; director of photography, Eric Alan Edwards; edited by Jay Cassidy; music by Cliff Martinez; production designer, Devorah Herbert; produced by Bryan Furst, Sean Furst, Tom Lassally, Robyn Meisinger and Bob Yari; released by Yari Film Group.

But if Mr. Conway, who died in 1998 (three months before Kubrick himself), was really as ridiculous as the character Mr. Malkovich creates, could he have gotten away with his scams? I wonder.One who crossed his path was Frank Rich of The New York Times, who encountered Conway-as-Kubrick in a London restaurant. When he looked further into the man's identity, he discovered the ruse and in 1993 wrote a column about it.Mr. Malkovich's flamboyant hustler is only the latest in his gallery of eccentric, owl-eyed flimflam men. Since ''Dangerous Liaisons'' nearly 20 years ago, he has more or less owned the type: a seducer-thief who speaks in weirdly slowed-down speech patterns and casts a hypnotic power. His Conway is nowhere near as convincing a sociopath as the murderous Tom Ripley, a role that seemed made for him in ''Ripley's Game,'' but he is still fun to observe.With a soundtrack built around excerpts from Kubrick film scores and an opening scene that parodies ''A Clockwork Orange,'' this arch, episodic movie is really an affectionate sequence of in-jokes conceived as a posthumous homage to Kubrick by two knowing insiders.Brian Cook, the director, was an assistant director on the Kubrick films ''The Shining,'' ''Barry Lyndon'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut.'' Anthony Frewin, who wrote the screenplay, was Kubrick's personal assistant. The in-jokes even extend to one about Mr. Malkovich himself that alludes to the 1999 movie ''Being John Malkovich.''Mr. Conway, who was gay and seriously alcoholic, used his celebrity alter ego to prey on young men, often encountered in bars, to whom he coyly disclosed his false identity before seducing them with promises of work as actors or designers on forthcoming projects. Sometimes he invented the films' titles on the spot. He also cadged drinks, claiming he had left his credit card at home. His marks were only too happy to pay. To impress them, he liked to meet them outside the front door of a fancy address that wasn't his.In the film these slightly unnerving scenes suggest how shameless flattery, name-dropping and chutzpah can carry a determined seducer wielding a bogus celebrity mystique. A recurring joke is that Conway wasn't all that careful in his research. His knowledge of Kubrick's films had major gaps, and more than once he slips up, is caught and is forced to flee.The scam to which the movie devotes the most time involves Conway/Kubrick's promise to help establish Lee Pratt (Jim Davidson), a gold-tuxedo-wearing television entertainer with dyed blond hair, as a star in Las Vegas. While they lay plans to conquer America, Lee, a low-rent Liberace with an Elvis gleam in his eye, installs Conway in a luxury hotel suite on the south coast of England. Relishing his dual roles of celebrity and star maker, Conway lives high on the hog, consuming gallons of vodka and cartons of cigarettes until Lee's manager becomes suspicious, and the game is up.Although the movie provides scattered glimpses into Conway when he is not on the make, they are too few to give a coherent sense of who he might be beneath his poses. Perhaps, like many performers, he fully exists only when playing a role. Once the movie gets started, it doesn't know where to go or how to end. It more or less repeats itself.The sharpest satire is reserved for the fools who swallow an act that seems transparently fake. Anyone who has watched a TV star besieged by gawking and drooling fans knows what encounters with fame can do in a culture of blind celebrity worship.Color Me Kubrick  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Brian Cook; written by Anthony Frewin; director of photography, Howard Atherton; edited by Alan Strachan; music by Bryan Adam; production designer, Crispian Sallis; produced by Mr. Cook and Michael Fitzgerald; released by Magnolia Pictures.

She's a quiet one, this girl, with a small, enigmatic smile and no evident inner life. When we first meet her she's about 10 and playing an upright piano in her family's living room. Her hands attack the keys with force, as if she were stabbing rather than tickling the keys. In case we missed the point of this violence, and, really, there is only one point to be had in this film, the director Denis Dercourt keeps cutting between the girl and a man rapidly hacking away at a large slab of beef with a knife.Will the knife prick human flesh? Will the dagger find its mark? Those rather big questions vibrate inside this rather small film, shaking it like a V-8 engine dropped in a Volkswagen Bug. The parts don't really fit together, but individually they are just fine, starting with that creepy girl, M&#232;lanie (Julie Richalet), who will soon grow up to be an equally creepy woman (D&#232;borah Fran&#231;ois, from ''L'Enfant''). But before that happens, the formidable Ms. Richalet will lay claim to her part of the film with a ferocity that might give pause to even Isabelle Huppert, who played the title character in ''The Piano Teacher.'' (These two could make beautifully sick music with the aspiring concert pianist in the French thriller ''The Beat That My Heart Skipped.'')Only after the initial piano playing and meat hacking does Mr. Dercourt's story get down to business. An only and apparently beloved child, M&#232;lanie suffers a life-altering setback during a decisive recital. One of the judges, a concert pianist, Ariane Fouch&#232;court (Catherine Frot, persuasively haughty and then a-tremble), carelessly interrupts the performance, throwing the girl off balance and key. Humiliated, enraged or simply shocked (we never learn which), M&#232;lanie locks her piano and stashes away her Beethoven bust. By the time she takes it out again, she is attractively adult and now played by Ms. Fran&#231;ois and working for Ariane's family as a nanny, having insinuated herself into its well-appointed bosom like an asp. How does M&#232;lanie extract her revenge? Practice, practice, practice.More concretely, she prowls about the Fouch&#232;court estate like a burglar. She also cooks a skinned rabbit (apparently she shops at the same meat market as Catherine Deneuve's looney-tune blonde in ''Repulsion'') and plays some curious games with the family's young son, Tristan (Antoine Martynciow). More conveniently for her and for the plot, she starts turning the pages of Ariane's sheet music, steadying the pianist's rattled nerves. Glances are exchanged, fires are lighted and fingers gently brushed as Shostakovich meets Sappho amid narrative feints and a heavy-breathing encounter near the tennis courts. The music skitters nervously as does, rather understandably, Ariane, and, rather humorously, a male cellist who fails to see the menace either in M&#232;lanie or a very sharp spike.A would-be psychological thriller with next to no psychology and shivers instead of thrills, ''The Page Turner'' is a nervous-making, lightly amusing vengeance story that owes an obvious debt to Claude Chabrol. M&#232;lanie's father is, for no particular reason, a butcher -- he's the hacker with the knife -- which may be a nod to Mr. Chabrol's 1969 film ''Le Boucher.'' Yet for all the familiar ingredients, including the bourgeois family at its center, ''The Page Turner'' is finally ersatz Chabrol, absent the master's perverse wit, complex psychology, social sensitivities and visual flair. M&#232;lanie looks like pretty poison, but she's a conceit rather than a woman or beast, a bad seed that never blooms into a flower of evil.The Page Turner  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Denis Dercourt; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Mr. Dercourt and Jacques Sotty; director of photography, J&#232;rome Peyrebrune; edited by Fran&#231;ois G&#232;digier; music by J&#232;rome Lemonnier; produced by Michel Saint-Jean; released by Tartan Films.

Then more heads. The vacant lot wasn't vacant at all. It was occupied by a prosperous colony of ground squirrels -- Spermophilus beecheyi, named after the English explorer Sir Frederick William Beechey, who visited California in the H.M.S. Blossom 180 years ago. I did not know about Sir Frederick at the time. I knew only that these were ground squirrels and that this vacant lot was a ground squirrel subdivision and that I had just eaten a burger and a doughnut for lunch in the city of Pomona, Calif., which is named for a minor Roman goddess of tree fruits.What surprised me were the burrows. They were mounded at the entrance, like the burrows you'd find in a Wyoming prairie dog town, and they somehow turned the vacancy of that empty lot into habitat. The squirrels stood guard on their haunches and raced from hole to hole. Almost instinctively I found myself imagining their tragic history, composing the saga of the ground squirrel in my mind. This was a relict population -- the last of a dying breed, cut off from their kind by the unconscious savagery of human encroachment, their world now bounded by an auto parts store, a busy highway, the back alley of an apartment complex and the parking lot of Donut &amp; Burger. The San Gabriel Mountains loomed impossibly distant for them. I wondered if they had been reduced to eating fries.But you don't have to read very much about Spermophilus beecheyi -- never mind Sir Frederick William Beechey -- to realize that California ground squirrels are nearly human in their adaptability. And like all creatures that are nearly human in their adaptability, humans consider them pests. Ground squirrels invade gardens and damage plants. They can carry bubonic plague. They destroy the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their burrows can extend for dozens of feet.I found myself telling a new story. The ground squirrels in that vacant lot are colonists, opening new terrain to an expansionist species, developing the site before the human developers can do so. Perhaps this is one of a series of vacant lots scattered across the Los Angeles basin, an archipelago of ground squirrels quietly shaping the earth to suit their needs. They watch the humans eating at Donut &amp; Burger and know their time will come.The squirrels reminded me of my last flight to Wyoming. I changed planes in Denver, and during the layover I watched a small flock of sparrows -- five or six -- that were living in one of the terminals. They betrayed no anxiety, no frantic fluttering toward the lights or windows. They behaved exactly the way sparrows do when they're at home. They flew up to an architectural strut and preened, and then flew down to the carpet and hopped across the waiting areas, silently scavenging for food. I imagined a separate species of sparrow evolving over the years to come, breeding quickly, adapting precisely to the conditions inside Denver International Airport.I drive past Donut &amp; Burger from time to time on my way to the freeway. I look into the lot and try to catch sight of the squirrels looking out at the traffic. Perhaps they know what an idle concept vacancy really is. I catch the Foothill Freeway a mile or two north, and I notice, again, how common it is to see hawks soaring high overhead. Now I know what they are feeding on.Editorial Observer</text></article><article id="1834958"><summary>Jeannette Catsoulis reviews film The Last Mimzy, directed by Bob Shaye; Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn star (M)</summary><text>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Bob Shaye  94 minutesInvoking Lewis Carroll, ''E.T.'' and Tibetan Buddhism, ''The Last Mimzy'' is an overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama about a dying planet, resourceful kids and a science teacher firmly in touch with his spiritual side.Adapted from Lewis Padgett's ''Jabberwocky''-inspired short story, ''Mimsy Were the Borogoves,'' the movie follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings, Noah and Emma Wilder (Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn), who find a mysterious box on the beach of their Seattle summer home. Among its contents are a stuffed rabbit and some strange crystals, and as the children play with them, they begin to develop unsettling abilities. While Noah talks to bugs and draws Tibetan mandalas, Emma becomes convinced that the bunny is trying to deliver a message. From the future.Despite leaden direction (by New Line Cinema's founder, Bob Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation, time travel and telepathy -- ''The Last Mimzy'' is a wholesome, eager entertainment that doesn't talk down. Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn are particularly effective as Noah's science teacher and the teacher's New Age-y fianc&#233;e, supplying the energy missing from Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson's parental performances and goosing the clunky screenplay at critical moments.The latest entry in the swelling ranks of poisoned-planet movies, ''The Last Mimzy'' suffers from jarring product placement -- aimed at parents rather than children-- and an overdependence on close-ups. A film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame.''The Last Mimzy'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a thimbleful of strong language and a bucketful of New Age ideas.JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</text></article><article id="1834959"><summary>Jeannette Catsoulis reviews film Memory, directed by Bennett Davlin; Billy Zane and Dennis Hopper star (M)</summary><text>Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.  Directed by Bennett Davlin  98 minutesIn ''Memory'' Billy Zane plays Dr. Taylor Briggs, a researcher specializing in memory loss who becomes infected by a powdery substance while examining a patient in Brazil. Before you can say, ''What's that again?,'' Taylor is having dream-infused seizures, during which he sees running children, flapping vegetation and a masked man in a black duster. The more he investigates the source of his visions, the more we are treated to shots of him staring at a computer while furrowing his brow. Audiences will leave the theater wearing a similar expression.Directed by Bennett Davlin from his own novel (he confesses to beginning the screenplay, along with Anthony Badalucco, the day after finishing the novel), ''Memory'' is an inane, sluggish mess. Even Ann-Margret and Dennis Hopper, as Taylor's sort-of surrogate parents, appear to have forgotten their profession. Any talent here is evidenced by the cinematographer, Peter Benison, who wakes up during the dream sequences to shoot some interesting angles before nodding off again.Meanwhile, the plot-- a febrile blend of serial murder, genetic contagion and mannequin-making -- advances more slowly than a cure for Alzheimer's.Filled with labored exposition, stilted line readings and the most unconvincing romantic hookup since Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley, ''Memory'' suffers most from Mr. Zane's Ken-doll performance.

Directed by Kevin Munroe  90 minutesAs Hollywood falls over itself to produce greener movies with ecologically correct themes, only the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remain willing to suggest that there is an upside to toxic waste. Spawned by sludge and grandiosely named after Renaissance artists, these crime-fighting reptiles have been rechristened ''TMNT'' and redrawn by an army of computer-generated-imagery specialists. Nevertheless, the now-23-year-old gang -- perhaps to connect better with its target audience -- is still living at home.Picking up where the third movie left off 14 years ago, the story finds Michelangelo clowning at children's parties, Donatello manning a tech support hot line, Raphael playing nighttime vigilante and Leonardo skulking in the Central American jungle. But when a wealthy New York industrialist (snootily voiced by Patrick Stewart) begins collecting 3,000-year-old monsters (all 13 of which are likely to be coming soon to a Happy Meal near you), Leo must rejoin his brothers to avert the end of the world. Or something.A strange blend of the futuristic and the ancient, ''TMNT'' offers an impressive lack of visual texture and discouraging human representation. (Maybe one day animators will learn that the female body requires space between the hips for more than just a bellybutton.) The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.''TMNT'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has toothy monsters, scary female body images and ferociously ripped reptiles.JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</text></article><article id="1834961"><summary>Jeannette Catsoulis reviews film Boy Culture, directed by Q Allan Brocka; Derek Magyar and Patrick Bauchau star (M)</summary><text>Opens today in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Directed by Q. Allan Brocka  Not rated; 88 minutesBased on the novel by Matthew Rettenmund, ''Boy Culture'' is a slick and absorbing drama about an attractive gay hustler named X (Derek Magyar), with an extensive investment portfolio and a restricted clientele of 12 wealthy men. When not servicing his ''disciples,'' X conducts a volatile relationship with his two roommates (Darryl Stephens and Jonathon Trent) and criticizes the gay lifestyle in cynical voice-over. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client (elegantly played by Patrick Bauchau) is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own.Employing a thoughtful, probing tone, the screenplay (by Philip Pierce and Q. Allan Brocka, who also directs) is a cerebral blend of insight, wit and raunchy self-awareness. As a hustler who disapproves of promiscuity and keeps a statue of the Virgin Mary in his closet because ''she looks like she's demanding a child-support check from God,'' X may be hypocritical and irreverent, but he's never illogical. He's a philosopher-queen.In a role that could easily have slipped into bitchy smugness, Mr. Magyar gives the character a self-deprecating charm that's enormously appealing. X has no objection to love; it's just that what he views as the obsessions of gay culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- exhaust him, and he attacks them with an anthropologist's eye and a comedian's tongue. ''Try to keep up,'' he tells us at the beginning of the movie. It's very good advice.JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</text></article><article id="1834963"><summary>Matt Zoller Seitz reviews film Pride, directed by Sunu Gonera; Terrence Howard stars; photo (M)</summary><text>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Sunu Gonera  104 minutes''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard) leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, illustrates the adaptability and limitations of the sports movie.The film is based on fact: Mr. Howard's character, Jim Ellis, coached generations of African-American teenagers in competitive swimming in Philadelphia. The film's director, a Zimbabwean, Sunu Gonera, pours on the period details: plaid shirts, Afros and Nixon-era street slang (''Jive turkey!''); a soundtrack featuring the O'Jays, the Staple Singers, the Philadelphia All-Stars and other Philadelphia R&amp;B legends.Most striking is the film's depiction of a more blatant version of racism. A prep school athletic director (Tom Arnold) flatly denies the hero a job on the basis of his race; later, when Jim takes his swimmers to the racist coach's suburban turf, white onlookers taunt them and boo their every mistake.Otherwise, ''Pride'' is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. Stock elements include a saintly, tough-love coach; an outwardly cynical lieutenant (Bernie Mac) who is a closet idealist; and a naysayer (Kimberly Elise as a budget-cutting councilwoman) who is converted by the hero's sexy decency.The team includes a reformed delinquent, a bespectacled nerd and a stuttering angel. The movie serves up the expected ratio of setbacks to triumphs and closes with video footage of the real Jim Ellis.But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still leaps.''Pride'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes violence, mild profanity and racist behavior.MATT ZOLLER SEITZ</text></article><article id="1834964"><summary>Matt Zoller Seitz reviews Alexandra Lipsitz documentary film Air Guitar Nation (M)</summary><text>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Alexandra Lipsitz  82 minutes''You can't hold a gun if you're holding an air guitar.''That Cheech and Chong sentiment is the manifesto of this documentary's title subculture, in which pantomiming aspiring rockers compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order.It sounds like the premise of a reality show. Sure enough, according to news releases, this breezy 82-minute movie is descended from an aborted VH-1 series overseen by Magical Elves Productions, the makers of ''Project Runway'' and ''Last Comic Standing.'' Stylistically, it's nothing special, apart from its T-shirt-ready freeze-frames and lucid, playful editing (by Conor O'Neill). Like ''Spellbound,'' ''Murderball'' and other competition documentaries, it's a valentine to underdog dreamers: ''Rocky'' gone basic cable.But the movie's wild performances and droll humor are tough to resist. So are its obsessive yet self-mocking heroes: the Los Angeles-based actor David Jung, who performs as C-Diddy, who has a kung phooey stage persona and wears a Hello Kitty pouch like a warrior's breastplate; and the New York writer-musician Dan Crane, a k a Bj&#246;rn Tur&#246;que, whose parched wit and jackhammer performance style suggest Bill Murray trapped in the body of Sid Vicious. Mr. Crane also wrote and sang the closing credits theme, a garage band anthem that lodges in the brain like a fishhook.''Air Guitar Nation'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

In the tradition of luminaries like Philip Johnson and Daniel Libeskind, Hayon's rubber azure frames have come to define his image -- an appropriately hipper, quirkier one than his dark-rimmed elders.His 2006 furniture collection for the Spanish manufacturer Bd Ediciones de Dise&#241;o -- which included bulbous zoomorphic vases and the charming Multileg cabinet, its feet a stylistic hodgepodge -- won him celebrity fans like Cindy Sherman as well as commissions from Moooi and Swarovski. And Lladr&#243; has now hired him as creative director to overhaul its fusty reputation.Hayon's glasses, made by the Venetian firm Ottica Carraro, serve to remind him of a time before anyone knew his name. He discovered them in 2003, during his tenure at Benetton's Fabrica research institute just outside of Treviso, his first serious job out of school. ''I adore Venice and went there often at the time,'' he recalls. ''I found Carraro and absolutely fell in love with their use of shape and materials.''The Carraro boutique is located off the Piazza San Marco in the same space it has occupied since 1967. ''The people there are great, and the glasses are handmade by artisans without any toxic components,'' Hayon explains. In the end, however, it was the frames' whimsical hue that really spoke to the designer, who has appeared in publicity photos dressed as Pierrot and as a pink bunny. ''I think they suit me well,'' he says.MONICA KHEMSUROVTIMELESS</text></article><article id="1835272"><summary>Highlights of suggested shopping tour of Rotterdam, Netherlands; photos; map (M)</summary><text>Mention Rotterdam and most in-the-know aesthetes think of mind-bending architecture, courtesy of homegrown wunderkinds like Rem Koolhaas.

Hidden behind an unmarked door at the back of a Boston convenience store that sells things like generic bleach and Jamaican soda, Bodega is the retail equivalent of a speakeasy (6 Clearway Street; www.bdgastore.com). Opened last year by Oliver Mak, Jay Gordon and Dan Natola (from left), the high-end streetwear shop has a cult following among shoppers looking for alternatives to mainstream luxury products. ''We like to be a bit elusive,'' Mak says, ''and our customers appreciate the secret-society factor.''2. Sneaker freakers flock to Bodega for collectible pairs, like this $100 limited-production Nike women's Air Force 1 Premium. It commemorates the 25th anniversary of AF1.3. Gordon used to skateboard and Mak still does, so they always have some interesting decks on hand. This $150 limited-edition, silk-screened model is by the artist Mickey Duzyj for No Mas.4. The partners sent 30 vintage Air Jordan jackets to the Los Angeles-based designer and self-described ''brand hijacker'' Darren Romanelli, who made them into 10 one-of-a-kind leather jackets, including this one for $2,000.5. Bodega's soundtrack is a democratic affair. ''We all get to play our favorites, and on a given day you'll hear Curtis Mayfield, Otis Redding, Frank Sinatra, Nas and French electro,'' Mak says. In heavy rotation at the moment: the latest CD by the Beat Awfuls, a local lo-fi rock band. Go to www.myspace.com/daviscavis.6. Gordon is obsessed with the ma&#237;z asado (grilled corn) at Toro, Ken Oringer's trendy tapas bar (1704 Washington Street; 617-536-4300; tapas from $5 to $14). ''It's flavored with garlic mayo, lime and cotija cheese, and it's highly addictive.''7. The lads might be arbiters of urban style, but their taste in hotels is strictly upscale. ''Fifteen Beacon is still the best hotel in Boston, and I always put visitors there,'' Gordon says (15 Beacon Street; 617-670-1500; www.xvbeacon.com; doubles from $295). ''The rooms are perfect, and the restaurant's wine list is one of the best in the country.''8. All three shop owners are film buffs, so luckily Boston is a movie lover's town. ''We attend midnight features at the Brattle, usually B horror films,'' Mak says (40 Brattle Street, Cambridge; 617-876-6837; www.brattlefilm.org). ''And we head to the Harvard Film Archive's Carpenter Center'' -- pictured -- ''for '70s and '80s experimental films. It's the only building by Le Corbusier in North America'' (24 Quincy Street; 617-495-4700; www.hcl.harvard.edu/hfa).9. They augment their own wardrobes with vintage finds from Bobby From Boston (19 Thayer Street; 617-423-9299) and designer pieces from Stel's (shown here, 334 Newbury Street; 617-262-3348). ''Stel's has a lot of brands that are difficult to find in Boston -- A.P.C., Nom de Guerre, Acne,'' Mak says. ''But we really go there to drink beer and play with Oonagh, the coolest dog in retail.''10. Not surprisingly, they love their toys, especially custom bikes by Independent Fabrication, a Somerville, Mass.-based company. ''These bikes are completely built from scratch using cutting-edge craftsmanship,'' Gordon says. The Ti Crown Jewel track bike shown here is $7,000; go to www.ifbikes.com.11. Limited to 500 pieces, this Know1edge/Maharishi watch is a take on an Officine Panerai model ($210 at Bodega). ''We like when functional objects are injected with urban street appeal,'' Mak says. ''And of course we love a cool collaboration.''</text></article><article id="1835279"><summary>Christopher Petkanas article on visit to Montappone, center of Italian hat production; photos (L)</summary><text>One of the dividends of a trip to an obscure place like Montappone, Italy -- an austere hill town in Le Marche and the center of Italian hat production -- is how it can suddenly press your replay button. Twenty-five years ago I used to go to the races at Longchamp. Marie-Helene de Rothschild ruled Paris then, yet it wasn't the queen bee who stole the show but an antique countess, Simone Saint-Just, with her exquisitely cocked trilby. Later, at a society wedding I covered, Helene Rochas's efforts to bag Stavros Niarchos were thwarted by a badly proportioned Saint Laurent pillbox worn too far forward on the forehead. And once at tea in the Rue Bonaparte apartment of Madeleine Castaing, she proceeded to drag out all her beautiful old hatboxes from the legendary modiste Paulette. That's three Big Hat Moments.If you're at all interested in headgear, Montappone should be on your list. Hats are the great fashion prescription, a reassuring antidote to the trampy antics of pantyless starlets and a muffled echo of a time when ladies were Ladies. Lately, designers as well as the worlds of hip-hop and Hollywood are loving their lids. For spring, Marni showed sky-high stovepipes; Prada, turbans. Marc Jacobs's collection for fall turns on a 1985 Givenchy picture hat. And we may yet discover that a fedora is what came between Cameron and Justin. You can admire milliners like Stephen Jones and Philip Treacy and walking hat installations like Isabella Blow and Anna Piaggi, but this is no time for bird-cage headwear. The money is on the classics: trilbys, Panamas, porkpies.Should you care if your porkpie is made in Italy? Montappone's 45 hat makers think so. Le Marche unfurls beside the Adriatic, backing onto Umbria, and is largely ignored by guidebooks. Shoes drive the regional economy, but hats are a $260 million-a-year business in Italy. Sixty million of them -- 70 percent of domestic output and half of Europe's -- are made in Montappone and in six neighboring towns.''It's difficult to get milliners to change, but these guys are open and have a good eye,'' says Orlando Palacios, who owns the Manhattan hat emporium Worth &amp; Worth and buys straw fedoras in Montappone. ''Their colors are not just the normal blacks, beiges and grays. They do a mossy green like you'd see on an old whitewashed wall.''Gianluca Messico, proprietor of the culty men's shop Moschus in nearby Senigallia, looked insulted when I suggested that Tuscany, Montappone's historic rival for straw and other hats, might make a better one. ''For quality,'' Messico sniffed, ''there's only Montappone.''Specialized manufacturing districts fabricating everything from buttons to restaurant supplies are a hopeful weapon in Italy's ongoing battle against massive production losses to Asia. Montappone is having it both ways, promoting its own hats while doing business with the enemy. The Sorbatti company -- which sells a ravishing superfino Panama for $1,000, a relative bargain -- imports one million pieces a year in finished goods from China, half the firm's volume. The other half allows the co-owner Marco Sorbatti to live with himself. The Italians have a rich culture of making things. If they stop, how will they know who they are?Montappone is as proud of producing gazillions of licensed Spiderman and Hello Kitty baseball caps as it is hats for Dolce &amp; Gabanna: a chapeau is a chapeau is a chapeau. For Laura Sorbatti, Marco's cousin and the owner of the firm Icas, whose love of hot pants and sunlamps has made her the Donatella Versace of the hat world, that chapeau is a hideous cap with the word ''gold'' picked out in rhinestones. Many ascribe to the romantic notion that hat making is encoded on the DNA of the Montapponese, and that they are capable of making any kind of hat fashion throws at them. But it is tempting to conclude that they might just as well be producing La-Z-Boys.Hats have been made here since the 17th century, the first in straw. It's still a popular material, but don't go expecting to see old ladies plaiting in doorways: straw is now imported in woven strips to be assembled by machine. In the old days, hand-weaving was a mindless task locals did while doing something else, like walking to church. The figures in the municipal hall's na&#239;ve 19th-century fresco of Montappone's townscape have golden ribbons streaming from their hands.No firm commercializes the sort of hat (catnip to collectors) that put the town on the map. To acquire a pastorella -- designed to keep the rays off suffering shepherdesses -- you must attend Il Cappello di Paglia (the straw-hat festival) in July, when they are woven by retirees and sold for about $70. Each one takes eight hours and 23 feet of straw strips one inch wide and 13 strands strong. It's a folkloric event that despite its staginess (oxen pull carts piled with hay) rings sincere, and it marks the only time of the year that the local companies get together to sell hats to the public. Residents dance jigs in the squares, and the wine flows.Outside the fair, Montappone has its charms. A fraction of the town's 1,800 inhabitants live in the stone borgo antico on the hilltop, encircled by blunt, stuccoed boxes built on hat fortunes. But what's a little graceless architecture when you're having an authentic mom-and-pop experience? The girl behind the counter at the New Bar cafe looks like she's never seen a tourist. Grown men watch cartoons while lunching at La Carovana. Personally I find it impossible not to admire a place whose antipasti offerings include a saut&#233;, lightly bound with egg, of diced lamb heart, liver, intestines and spleen as well as one organ, lung, the U.S.D.A. won't let you eat.And of course, there are the hats. The town's engagingly scrappy hat museum displays Fellini's last fedora, and a nearby exhibit shows pazzo one-off creations incorporating, say, a mechanized carousel. Although Complit is the only company with an outlet shop, if you call ahead, most factories are happy to sell directly to visitors, even tossing in a tour. At N.T.S., you can watch a felt bowler take shape on a hissing hydraulic press, then stroll out with it, or a top hat, a mere $40 poorer.A $13 boater brought my Big Hat Moments to four.

Six vocalists sway in sync, while the nine-piece band lays down a blend of hip-hop and African dance-hall rhythms for a crowd of 150. Dancing near the stage are a sweaty clutch of African construction workers, fresh from their 12-hour shifts. Sitting at the tables behind them are men from the Arab merchant class and their bejeweled girlfriends. At the back of the room, I spot a few American and English expatriates timidly checking out the scene. ''All these people have come to Dubai to work and make some money,'' says Bilenge Musica's manager, Lesasa Joker, surveying the crowd. ''And on their day off, if they have one, they come here.''If making money is what brings together Dubai's disparate working community -- some 80 percent are foreign nationals representing 160 countries -- then the social lubricant of night life is what keeps it all running smoothly. Pick up Time Out Dubai and you'll see page after page of listings for bars and clubs catering to every nationality, social layer, musical taste and sexual preference. Dubai after hours has become a kind of fun-house-mirror reflection of the city at large, entwining the land baron, office drone and construction laborer. And in a land of manufactured islands and indoor ski slopes, going out just may be the closest thing to an authentic cultural experience this town has to offer.''Dubai is all about status,'' says Jessica Glunz, a manager of Dubai's biggest dance club, Trilogy, in the Madinat Jumeirah Resort. Wearing Mavi capri jeans, heels and a jaunty cap, Glunz stands outside the front door with a clipboard, smiling as another Maybach -- the second in 15 minutes -- pulls around. ''We're like the Miami of the Middle East,'' she says, eyes trained on the Maybach's back door. ''It's all about showing up in the best car, getting the best table and sharing the biggest bottle of Cristal with the best-looking group of girls.''Two stunning young Lebanese women in tight cocktail dresses and stilettos climb out of the car, followed by a man wearing new shoes, a shirt opened one button too many and too much cologne. Glunz waves them into a room that looks something like a Studio 54 version of Mad Max's Thunderdome. Above the dance floor are V.I.P. rooms where groups of partyers horse around, spilling $1,000 bottles of Champagne on each other for the amusement and envy of the crowd.Western-style excess is, predictably, the predominant ethos among Dubai nightclubs, which are almost always inside hotels. The mainstream places include the European-style Peppermint Club, in the Fairmont Dubai, the South Beach-esque rooftop playground at the One&amp;Only and an outpost of Paris's Buddha Bar in the Grosvenor House. But in old parts of town like Deira, Al Karama and Bur Dubai, you can glimpse the full United Colors of Dubai. Within several square blocks are a Russian music club, several Indian strip joints (partial-nudity only), a Japanese karaoke bar, a few hangouts popular with Eastern European prostitutes, a mixed gay-straight disco and a spot where you can catch an Iranian belly-dancing act. The most popular dives, for the moment, are the dozens of clubs featuring Filipino cover bands, like Maharlika Caf&#233;, where the headlining act is a six-piece all-girl group called Night and Gale that writhes its way through ''November Rain'' by Guns N' Roses.''There's this incredible dichotomy in Dubai,'' Andy Buchan, Time Out Dubai's night life and music editor, tells me.''You have the amazing opulence of places like the 360 Degrees lounge'' -- attached to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel -- ''and then just 10 minutes away, in the old town, there are spots like Club Africana where you stumble in, not knowing the first thing about it, and walk out five hours later saying to yourself, 'That was incredibly fun.' ''Officially, much of the fun that Dubai gets up to is forbidden. Mohamed Abdul Mannan, an executive with the government's tourism office, confirms that public drunkenness, prostitution, homosexuality, possession of illegal drugs and, as he puts it, ''kissy kissy'' in public are all punishable with prison time. ''You might find some traces of Las Vegas in our night life,'' Mannan says, ''but there is a line here.''Mostly that line seems to be little more than a ripple in the sand. Some years ago the royal Maktoum family, who rule Dubai, set aside religious strictures along with Islam's liquor ban in order to create a new Middle East playground. ''They had no choice,'' says Karim Bassante, a local columnist and radio commentator. The seven million yearly visitors -- many from around the region who can't live it up in their own countries -- need more than overhyped shopping and gigantic sinking islands. Now, Bassante asserts, ''we have nothing else going for us but our night life. Imagine if they arrested everyone who went out to clubs. Who would come and stay in the five-star hotels, or even work in them?''A government crackdown seems improbable, if not impossible. The city needs a monthly influx of more than 5,000 new residents in order to sustain economic growth. Already, Britain's Standard Chartered Bank has warned that property values in Dubai could slip 20 to 30 percent in two to three years. And given that some of the city's homeowners are fun-loving celebrities like Simon Cowell and David Beckham, Dubai can ill-afford to tinker with the delicate formula of its success.As 3 a.m. approaches, all the Grey Goose at Trilogy is polished off and the imported D.J.'s pack away their records. ''The thing is,'' says Jessica Glunz, ''Dubai definitely has the potential to be a party capital of the world if the government wants it to be. It's already the world's most famous city, and that took them how long? Ten years?'' From here the revelry moves behind closed doors: I tag along with a couple of wealthy party boys, who cruise around looking for pretty people to scoop up. We join the after-hours party at someone's hotel room, where there are drinks and dancing and enough drugs to fill a pharmacy. Pretty soon, the live entertainment arrives: naked male and female dancers paid to perform with snakes, &#224; la Britney Spears.Essentials DubaiClubs and bars Most places have a particular theme or cater primarily to one ethnic audience. 360 Degrees and the Apartment Lounge and Club International.

The Spanish Riding School, one of Vienna's most popular tourist attractions, is a particularly eloquent example of this genre. The Hapsburg dynasty bit the dust in 1918. But the family's favorite breed of horse rides on and on as if two world wars had never happened.As the fabled Lipizzaner stallions enter the arena, a Baroque hall of billowing whiteness designed in 1729 by Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, the riders doff their bicorn hats to a portrait of Charles VI displayed in the imperial box. In the 80-minute performance that follows, horses and riders demonstrate haute &#233;cole riding maneuvers that were already ancient when the emperor himself was in the audience. (He ruled from 1711 to 1740.) We all miss him terribly.Presented with music by various Strausses, the performance will put some viewers in mind of ''Swan Lake.'' Magically, dancers have been transformed into white horses. The riders are their male partners. Demonstrations of classical dressage recall ballet variations. Instead of fouett&#233;s, entrechats and pas de deux, there are levades, courbettes -- and pas de deux.There are moments when you think that the horses are carrying the entire weight of the Baroque tradition on their backs. They make the burden look nearly weightless, but if you pay close attention to their facial expressions and the play of their voluptuous muscles, you can see the strenuous physical and mental exertion that the illusion demands. This paradox is a fundamental principle of the Baroque. Handel arias, clouds, mirrors, classical ballet, domes floating on light beams, fireworks: these elaborately contrived anti-gravitational devices seem to branch off from the same strand of cultural DNA from which the Lipizzaners are bred.I think of it as my personal Genome Project. And the Baroque DNA is still going strong today. Aerospace technology, contemporary architecture, pop spectacles and celebrity magazines are mutated descendants of Baroque forms. Even absolutism, the Baroque's contribution to governance, is trying for a comeback in the political sphere, often under the banner of patriotism. These mutations warrant taking a closer look at earlier strains of the Baroque cultural code.Like fireworks, the performance we see today is an aestheticized form of military muscle. The famous capriole, in which the horse simultaneously leaps into the air while kicking its rear legs backward, was used to clear more space around the horse during armed engagement. It's the equine way of saying, ''Get off my back!''That territorial gesture dramatizes the Baroque breed's late-16th-century origins. Society's relationship to the land was changing. Work requirements for peasants were relaxed, over the objections of aristocratic landlords. The ancient equation balancing property and authority was no longer stable. It must have seemed as if the laws of social gravity were being revised, and shortly might even be suspended. Where was there to go but up, up and away?Another two centuries would pass before hot-air balloons took off, but already the skyline of the Baroque city had created an airborne impression. The period's characteristic domes, the rooflines encrusted with outstretched eagle wings and the columns surmounted by angels and saints combined to lift the urban horizon. The codification of ballet steps made bodies look so weightless that they seemed poised to join their painted counterparts in Tiepolo's blue skies. Why wouldn't military forces assume the appearance of buoyancy?So you will observe, as the Lipizzaners make an initial circle around the hall, that their hoofs scarcely disturb the covering of sawdust underneath but seem, rather, to glide over the groomed surface on the tips of their toes. Reversing the common pastime of imagining that clouds are animals, you will also note that the swelling curves of gleaming white pelts are a genetic near-match for the cumulus species drifting over the city outside and the dollops of whipped cream that accompany the pastries at the Demel.Shorn since 1918 of an empire that once included present-day Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and parts of Italy and Serbia, among other countries, Vienna now seems like a ceremony carried on without its former reason for being. That accounts for much of the city's ethereal atmosphere. But even its former reason for being was tentative at best. At the height of its glory as an imperial city, there was no Austrian nation as such: the non-Hungarian portions of Austria-Hungary were designated merely as the kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council. No wonder Austria, after World War I, could be described as the country that died for want of a name.So the Baroque gene flourished in a climate of high tolerance for abstraction. This may explain why functionalist design, atonal music and other key ideas of modern art were first formulated in Vienna. Abstraction had to perform much of the work traditionally conducted on the material plane of private property. This tendency may also help to explain the fascination that the Baroque holds for people today, as modern nations continue to prop up old symbols of forces that have been rapidly dispersing beyond national control.I can foresee a time, in a future not too distant, when today's military techniques will be every bit as much the stuff of family entertainment as the Lipizzaner. By then, of course, the Chinese will have called in the chips. The American economy will rest on a slim base of tourism, corn products and casino gambling. And the mysterious Area 51 will have been converted into a modernist version of the Spanish Riding School. Instead of listening to Strauss waltzes, visitors will hear Sousa marches broadcast through wireless earbuds no larger than corn kernels. Tanks and stealth bombers will perform synchronized routines inspired by the June Taylor Dancers. Black Hawk helicopters will demonstrate mechanized versions of the Lipizzaner capriole, rising up and rotating playfully in empty space.Icons</text></article><article id="1835289"><summary>Kurt Andersen article on Omaha, Neb, his native city, and its newly flourishing indie arts scene; photos (L)</summary><text>When I tell people I'm originally from Omaha, they often confuse it with Oklahoma or Iowa. ''Omaha,'' a Manhattan photographer I met the other day said. ''That's near Nebraska, isn't it?'' Omaha is one of those ultimate flyover places, an urban Podunk so vaguely situated in coastal Americans' mental maps that the mere mention of it can actually halt conversation.Sometimes I rattle off the names of movie stars from Omaha: Fred Astaire, Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, Nick Nolte. . . . Of course, this pantheon also implies that it is a place that requires its most exciting citizens to move on. Since Warren Buffett has become a household name, though, the city acquired a somewhat perverse new brand identity as an extraordinarily ordinary city where the most brilliant American investor and second-richest man in the country chooses to live, of all places!For the past three decades, I'd returned to Omaha once every year or two strictly to visit my parents, so my experience of the city had been pretty much limited to drives to and from the airport. But around 2003, I started hearing from New Yorkers that a kind of cultural awakening was afoot in my hometown.Omaha?It isn't yet Seattle or Austin, but it's no longer some kind of Great Plains version of Hartford or Fresno, either. ''Alternative'' and ''independent'' aren't just marketing catchwords in Omaha. The blossoming is real and multifarious. It didn't happen overnight. And it certainly didn't happen as a result of any grand master plan by the city establishment. Rather, it has been the improbable result of the hard work of a few local heroes.In 1968 I turned 14 and underwent the classic apostasy of the day, transforming from a stamp-collecting, Nixon-campaign nerd to a pot-smoking, antiwar muckraker. A certain grotty block downtown on Howard Street instantly became my countercultural ground zero. The neighborhood, known as the Old Market, was excitingly urban, with faded commercial signs painted on the sides of unoccupied 19th-century warehouses, entirely unlike my leafy ''Leave It to Beaver'' neighborhood. In one building, an art gallery and a head shop had opened. Next door was a jerry-built movie theater called the Edison Exposure, where that fall I saw my first art film -- the regional premiere of Andy Warhol's ''Chelsea Girls.'' Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, and to be young was very heaven.When I left Omaha in the '70s, the cool shops and restaurants extended only a hundred yards from the epicenter. The toehold of hip seemed doomed to remain only a toehold. If that. In 1988, as architectural preservation had become America's happy default mode, Omaha gave ham-fisted urban renewal one last gasp: east of the Old Market, 27 fine old buildings were demolished. I sort of gave up on the place. But during the decade I wasn't paying attention, the tide turned. The city was persuaded not to wipe away several more blocks of warehouses south of the Old Market district to build its convention center. And in the '90s, the area quadrupled in size -- building by building, organically.Some of my boyhood outposts of urban cool remain: the Antiquarium bookstore, Homer's Music and Gifts, M's Pub, the French Caf&#233; (which in 1969 called itself the best French restaurant between Chicago and San Francisco). Dozens of new restaurants and shops have joined them, including the charmingly un-American bistro La Buvette and Jackson Street Booksellers, my all-time favorite used-book store in America. Soon more than 1,000 new condominiums will enter the market, mostly converted lofts, but also a handsome new low-rise development (called, inevitably, SoMa, for ''south of the Market''). From one building hangs a marketing banner. ''Model,'' it says on the front, and on the back, ''Carpe Diem.''The main reason the Old Market wasn't wiped away is that a single family happened to own most of the real estate. That, and the fact that the family members are not, shall we say, typical Omahans.Sam Mercer arrived in 1866 and bought up swaths of the city. His grandson, also named Sam and now in his 80s, has overseen the family interests mainly from France. On one of his regular reconnaissance trips in 1964, Cedric Hartman, a young Omahan who had gone to New York but returned and who later became a designer, suggested to Mercer that he turn his defunct warehouses into a district of stylish shops, restaurants, theaters, apartments. Back then, that was a bizarre, visionary notion; SoHo did not yet exist.Mercer's son Mark, who had grown up on the East Coast and in Switzerland, soon moved to Omaha -- temporarily, it was thought, to help get the project on its feet. Forty years later, he and his German-born photographer wife still live in the Old Market, although they keep a Paris apartment. Mark Mercer is a distracted, Woody Allenish man. He had no training in urban planning. ''I did read Jane Jacobs,'' he said. ''It seemed obvious. But the real businesspeople didn't think it would work.''Hartman, meanwhile, became a renowned furniture and lighting designer. ''In this deadly situation'' -- Omaha back in the day, he means -- ''you could get work done if you had an adventurous mind.'' His headquarters is a 79-year-old former factory on the Old Market's edge. ''We were deadly bored with this town, and I wanted to make it better,'' he said. ''The Mercers haven't messed it up. And Ree Schonlau has been marvelous.''Schonlau, 61, grew up in a working-class neighborhood near the Old Market with dreams of being an artist. At the University of Omaha (now the University of Nebraska), she explained, ''all my professors said, 'If you're gonna make art, you've gotta leave town.' '' After spending time in New York, she returned to Omaha in 1971, leased space for a gallery in one of the Mercers' buildings -- 12,000 square feet, $300 a month -- cut up her surplus footage into artists' studios and discovered her m&#233;tier: not making art but enabling it. She turned the former Bemis Bag factory into a warren of studios and invited artists from around the world to come for residencies. Today more than 600 apply each year, and the Bemis Center occupies 100,000 square feet in two renovated warehouses. It has become, in effect, Omaha's museum of contemporary art. Schonlau now spends most of her time overseeing the business of her husband, the Japanese-born sculptor and painter Jun Kaneko. The couple are turning another building into a ''creativity museum'' that's to open in 2009.For young Americans, Omaha is probably best known as the home of a whole bunch of indie rock musicians -- members of the Faint, Cursive, the Good Life, Tilly and the Wall, Azure Ray and, most famously, Bright Eyes. They play in one another's bands, produce one another's records and nearly all release CDs through the local Saddle Creek label. Robb Nansel dreamed up Saddle Creek as a University of Nebraska business major; it was his thesis project. He grew up in Omaha and attended Creighton Prep, the local Roman Catholic high school. Many Saddle Creek musicians, including Conor Oberst (a k a Bright Eyes), also went to Prep, as it's called. As did the director Alexander Payne, who has set and filmed three movies here.''We're just sort of doing things the way we want to do them,'' Nansel said. Because Omaha is a cheap place to live -- a 1,300-square-foot loft in the Old Market rents for $575 a month -- he and his musicians are spared the financial anxiety of places like New York and L.A. ''I like to believe in the concept of putting out a record because it's good,'' he said, ''not to sell records.'' Saddle Creek releases six albums a year and has repeatedly turned down offers to be acquired by a big label.And it has recruited musicians from elsewhere to join its happy few, its band of brothers. Stefanie Drootin, now 28, was on tour with her L.A. band in 1996 when their van broke down in Omaha. She started playing with the Good Life and Bright Eyes and moved in with a bandmate. The former Athens, Ga., band Azure Ray -- Maria Taylor and Orenda Fink -- fell in love with Oberst and Todd Baechle of the Faint, respectively, and moved to Omaha. ''It was just a boy-based decision,'' Fink joked.The Internet has made it possible for people to pursue serious creative careers in a place like Nebraska, but also anywhere else. Why has it worked so weirdly well in Omaha? Beyond talent, it's because the musicians have longstanding bonds to one another and the city. ''We were all in it together,'' Nansel explained, and ''nobody wanted to be the first to throw in the towel.''In short, Omaha's cultural moment is all about the application of the great Midwestern bourgeois virtues -- thrift, square dealing, humility, hard work -- to bohemian artistic projects. On this, everyone agrees.''People here do business on a handshake,'' said Cary Tobin, the Bemis Center's residency program director, who was ''dying to get out of here'' when she graduated from high school in 1988 but returned after living in Italy and Seattle for a decade. Sarah Wilson was the assistant music editor for Interview in 2005 when she met Tim Kasher (Cursive, the Good Life) in New York. He convinced her to come to Omaha with him to write her novel. ''They are workaholics,'' she says of the Saddle Creek musicians.Nansel and his colleagues work so hard, in fact, that they've stumbled into real estate development. About a mile north of the Old Market, Saddle Creek is almost finished building a complex that will have retail space, a restaurant, apartments, the record company's offices, a music venue and a nonprofit film art house called Film Streams.Rachel Jacobson, 28, the founder of Film Streams, moved from Omaha to New York in 2000 with a plan: for five years she'd apprentice at Miramax Films and WNYC, the public radio station, then move back. Alexander Payne is on her board (disclosure: so am I), and in short order, she raised $1.5 million, mainly from locals. ''At first I had so much empty space in my head,'' she said. ''Moving back to Omaha was like when your ears ring right after you leave a loud concert. But it's so much easier to get things done.''For all these people, New York is the cultural lodestar, not Los Angeles. The novelist Timothy Schaffert lived in Brooklyn in the '90s, working as a book publicist. He ''really loved New York,'' but after a breakup, he returned to his native Nebraska. It was ''supposed to be temporary, a sanitarium experience.'' That was 12 years ago.Besides writing, he began the (Downtown) Omaha Lit Fest, in part, he says, as a pretext for importing New York authors for a couple of days a year. But he adores the un-New-Yorky anti-sophistication of the local sophisticates. ''I'm relieved that Omaha doesn't take itself too seriously in any obnoxious way,'' he said. ''There's still a touch of the honky-tonk, and there are still some lingering tones of self-deprecation.''I've never encountered an alternative sensibility lashed to such chamber of commerce enthusiasm. Rob Walters was a Chicago-based photographer and filmmaker who went to college with Nansel and moved to Omaha in 2004. Saddle Creek is ''so gung-ho about staying here,'' Walters said. ''Because Omaha is missing the metropolitan cultural thing, they don't want that to go away.''''There's no way,'' he said, ''that I could see Rachel doing what she's doing here five years ago.'' In 2007, as opposed to 2002, said Brigitte McQueen, a New York &#233;migr&#233; who telecommutes as the production manager of TeenPeople.com, ''something's changed. People are no longer hibernating. Our generation is about to take control and make the city the kind we want to live in.''Sarah Wilson told me in December that she was moving back to New York with Kasher.''I miss the electricity,'' she said. What normal 28-year-old would not? But she's rethought her plans since. ''As everyone predicted,'' she wrote in an e-mail message, ''the charms of Omaha are starting to wrestle me down to its frosty ground.'' For now, she's staying.Essentials Omaha, NebraskaHOTEL Good lodging options in Omaha are fairly limited.

''We want guests to wake up in their rooms and feel immediately that they're in Portland and couldn't be anywhere else,'' Calderwood says.Like their first project, the Ace Seattle, which has spare interiors that grew out of sleek '90s minimalism, the larger and more ambitious Portland hotel is grounded in both the specifics of place and the zeitgeist. Rooms refer to the city's independent spirit and cultural scene with hand-painted murals (mostly by art students and street artists), tables made of stacked old books (from Portland's secondhand ''bins'' shops) and record players (borrow vinyl from the front desk). To keep the ecological footprint small, materials salvaged from the formerly run-down building -- from bathtubs to signs to doorknobs -- were restored and reused. New items were largely sourced from local companies. And to ensure low costs, the team embraced utilitarian items like utility clip lights mounted as reading lights above beds.Part of the Ace philosophy is to create an egalitarian atmosphere by bringing together creative types with tight budgets and more affluent travelers willing to trade down, as it were, in exchange for cool. (The hotel's name is inspired by the card: the highest or lowest in the deck.) Rooms with a shared bath, including three ''band rooms'' with bunks for touring musicians, are $85, while luxe penthouse rooms top out at just $250. Service is ''limited,'' meaning you'll schlep your own bag. And that seems fine with most guests. In a world dense with slick and sterile design hotels, the Ace aims to be a counterpoint. ''Perfection can be intellectually stimulating,'' Calderwood says. ''But things that are slightly imperfect have soul.''Ace Hotel Portland, 1022 Southwest Stark Street; (503) 228-2277; www.acehotel.com.</text></article><article id="1835292"><summary>Stephen Metcalf article on visit to Faroe Islands in North Atlantic; photos (L)</summary><text>In a small cafe in a town called Nolsoy, on an archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic, surrounded by barflies and the blue fug of cigarette smoke, I am trying to be unobtrusive. This is not going so well. There are precisely two occupied tables in the establishment, the barflies' and mine. At mine, English is spoken, pallid beer is sipped, and all eye contact is avoided. At theirs, they speak a derivative of Old Norse, drink a rigorous liquor and shoot glances my way, accompanied by throaty chuckles. I, in fact, look not only like an American and a tourist, but also like an idiot, having walked up onto the quayside at Nolsoy, through its most famous landmark -- the bone archway formed by the massive jaws of a sperm whale -- and into its one bar wearing a flotation suit. A giant, puffy, one-piece flotation suit. Ten minutes ago, thudding across freezing harbor waters in a Zodiac, a flotation suit had seemed like a good idea. Now it makes me look like a Power Ranger. The chuckles are starting to crescendo. As I exit the place, from behind me I hear, ''Zay hallo to George Bush.''Nolsoy is a higgledy-piggledy little village, and the locals in its one bar are fishermen on extended hiatus. On a Sunday, Nolsoy's few aimless streets are deserted, as is the eerily well-kept football pitch that straddles the waterfront. The men, ominously, have filed out of the bar behind me. But when they approach, they approach tentatively, almost shyly, until one finally speaks. ''You are American, yes?'' ''Yes.'' ''We have something we want to show you.'' I follow them down the slope of the village, toward the harbor, where they lead me to a small, padlocked boat shed. In the middle of the shed sits an exquisitely handcrafted rowboat -- a kind of modern Viking variation on the old New England dory, with a raised prow, a small mast stacked with running lights and the words ''Diana Victoria'' painted along its stern. So this is it, I think. This is Ove Joensen's boat.If you are to understand the Faroe Islands, maybe the most curious place left on earth, you would do well to start with Ove Joensen's boat. Joensen was a sailor in Nolsoy who, in his spare time, built the Diana Victoria by hand, and for one purpose only: to row the 900 miles, via the Shetland Islands, all the way to mainland Europe. Joensen wasn't a glory seeker; he wanted to raise money for Nolsoy so that it could afford a new town swimming pool. Nonetheless, in 1986, when he arrived in Copenhagen and leapt out of the Diana Victoria to kiss the statue of the Little Mermaid, he was greeted by a roaring throng -- there are about 10,000 Faroese living in Denmark -- as cameras threw the images back to the Faroes on live TV. Joensen had completed the brutal task in just 41 days.The men around the Diana Victoria relay the story carefully, piece by piece, each detail of Ove Joensen's life laid out delicately, like a tiny wreath. They conclude by telling me, mostly in gestures, that after the journey, Joensen's hands never fully unfurled. Three months after his triumph, he slipped on the deck of a boat and slid into the icy waters below. Ove Joensen, whose feat is still celebrated in the Faroes with festivities every August, was dead by a freak accident at the age of 39. In the interior gloom, the men's eyes glint with pride as their hands stroke the flanks of the rowboat. When I note how unusually small the blades of Joensen's oars are, one of the men snorts and says, ''That's your problem. Why are your oars so big?''The Faroe Islands are an archipelago of 18 upthrusted hunks of igneous rock in the middle of precisely nowhere, the stretch of North Atlantic halfway between Norway and Iceland. It is oddly temperate, thanks to the currents of the Gulf Stream, and oddly green, thanks in part to the two million pairs of seabirds -- guillemots, fulmars, storm petrels and, of course, the famously cute puffins -- that carpet the islands in guano each breeding season. The Faroes are easily the most moodily beautiful place I have ever been. Each island is a giant slice of elaborately tiered basalt, tilted to one side and covered in green, tussocky felt. Streamer clouds, almost mannered in their perfection, encircle the mountains. Rocky cliffs, topped in ar&#234;tes and tarns, plunge into the sea, while up from the water jut massive, looming sea stacks. It rains here a lot, and waterfalls flow pretty much continuously. Driving to my hotel from the airport, the only thing I could make out through the mist was the dull nacre of the rills, dozens of them, snaking their way down the sides of the mountains.Vikings settled the islands more than a thousand years ago, and almost 50,000 of their descendants now live here, sharing space with 75,000 more or less freely roaming sheep. Although the Danes took formal possession of the Faroes in 1380 and have never fully relinquished it, ''We are not Danish'' is a common refrain here. (When a country woman said it to me, her eyes flashed hotly before settling back into Scandinavian stolidity.) No, the Faroese are nothing if not Faroese. They speak their own language, recite their own sagas, dance their own raucous chain-formation dance (based on the old French branle simple) and still sing quarter-note, Gregorian-like chants. Their icon remains the turf-roofed house. When the Vikings first arrived, they made rock foundations in the shapes of their boats, turned the boats over on top of the rocks and then, to stabilize and insulate these makeshift houses, put sod on the hulls of the boats. It is not uncommon to come upon a Faroese mowing his roof.To this day, when a Faroese man, looking out to the harbor, cries ''Grind,'' every man in town, from the barkeep to the mayor, drops what he is doing, reaches for a metal implement and sprints toward the water. The cry means whales have been spotted, are being herded into the harbor and now need to be slaughtered, in a ritual called a grindadrap. Within minutes, the harbor waters are drenched in red and the corpses of pilot whales lie on the dockside in a row. The precious meat and blubber is distributed, first according to who spotted and who killed, then according to need, with a special emphasis on the elderly, sick and poor.Early in my stay I visited with Eydun Dal-Christiansen, an artist and a stonecutter whose torso is so huge I thought he had to be wearing a chest protector beneath his shirt. (He wasn't.) Dal-Christiansen lives on the main island of Streymoy, a short drive outside of Torshavn, at 18,000 inhabitants Europe's smallest capital. Dal-Christiansen builds sinewy lamps out of stones he quarries while hiking alone in the mountains. Sitting in his kitchen, over instant coffee and diced-up candy bars, he told me that he considered his stones to be living things and added slowly, in halting English, ''Here in the Faroes, we live close to nature. Up in the mountains, in the fog, nothing can harm you.'' I had been struggling to understand the Faroes, and then one thing occurred to me: for being so unapologetically sexist, Faroese culture permits an immense and spiritual tenderness on the part of Faroese men. And for being so isolated, the Faroes may be the last place in Europe where you can still succumb to a mystical Yeatsian reverie, and without so much as a hint of kitsch.Jah, Jah, come in, come in. In the Faroe Islands, everyone invites you in. The wives serve coffee, then disappear. The men drink coffee and talk. And in recent times, the men talk about oil: ''We have just one leg to stand on. The fish are not enough. If we find oil. . . .'' More than 95 percent of the islands' exports come from fishing, but oil companies are prospecting in Faroe waters. A discovery would allow the Faroese to maintain their comfortable European lifestyle -- thanks in part to a large Danish subsidy -- but more in accord with their self-image, as a fiercely hardscrabble and thoroughly un-Danish people. Over and over again, I was cautiously supplied the latest rumor: ''You know, they had Champagne flown in to the rig last week.''The Faroese speak English well -- maybe not as flawlessly as the citizens of mainland Denmark, but they're often fluent or near-fluent. ''Oh, yes, thanks to MTV we learn it early now,'' John Eysturoy, my contact at the modest tourist board, tells me. ''The town council tried to take MTV away in the '90s, but the young people held a protest. So they took away BBC World instead.'' Dal-Christiansen and Eysturoy are old friends, and in the former's kitchen, they alternate between ripping on each other mercilessly and reflecting carefully on the status of the Faroes. Early in the Cold War the United States and NATO deemed the Faroes strategically important, stuck an early warning system on one of its mountaintops and told the Danes, in no uncertain terms, to increase their subsidy to the islands -- to use the teat, in other words, to stave off a growing independence movement. In a generation, with the help of a robust fishing industry, the Faroese went from village poverty to zesty, car-loving, suburban-style affluence.And yet the islands have stayed essentially an ancient place. In part, this is a matter of scale. You could fit the entire Faroese population in Rose Bowl -- almost twice over. ''That's the stupid thing about the Faroe Islands,'' Eysturoy says, pointing at Dal-Christiansen. ''One hour after he's done something stupid, I know about it.'' Unlike, say, the Shetlanders to their south, the Faroese have carefully preserved their language. (I was introduced to a snow-haired man in a tweed jacket, a professor known as ''the protector of the Faroese tongue.'' He is tasked with creating new words in Faroese, for things like ''helicopter'' and the ''at'' sign in e-mail.) And compared with the Icelanders to their north, their rituals have yet to be taken over by the trappings of tourist simulacra. ''In Iceland, you can see a Viking town, but it is not real,'' Eysturoy tells me.Eysturoy is a soulful hangdog of a 50-something man. He loves the Faroe Islands deeply, but honestly, and applies his favorite epithet -- ''stupid'' -- to them liberally. After about 10 minutes in his acquaintance, I knew I had a friend for life, but I did manage to step out of bounds once. I had lamented having missed, by a scant 10 days, a whale kill, and as we sat drinking at his men's club in Torshavn, trading insults, I asked Eysturoy if he would kindly swim out into the Atlantic and lead a pod of pilot whales in a chain dance. At this he grew silent. There is no funning the grindadrap, a source of both considerable pride and anxiety to a native islander. Greenpeace used to agitate about the kills, in spite of the fact that the pilots are not endangered and that the Faroese use every ounce of every one of the 1,000 whales taken in an average year. ''The kills are very humane,'' Eysturoy said. ''A veterinarian designed the method.'' I tried to make up for my blunder by asking him, ''So, if someone yelled 'Grind' now, you would head to the harbor?'' Without pausing, Eysturoy replied, ''Of course. Or I would not be Faroese.''Later, a few miles out of Torshavn in Kirkjubour, the most ancient of ancient places in the Faroes, Eysturoy holds an old whaling knife up to my nose. The smell of blubber on the blade is rich and dank. The knife, like everything in Kirkjubour, is very old. Settled life began here more than a millennium ago. With no trees (hard basalt lies too close to the surface of the soil), all the early houses were built out of driftwood. Kirkjubour's original sod-roof farmhouse, known as the Roykstovan, still stands, and is the oldest inhabited wooden structure in Europe. Here, more than anywhere, one feels the spirit of the Faroe Islands. ''Roykstovan'' means ''smoke room,'' and everything happened in this, the one room where the tribe could afford to make a fire, by burning peat. They slept, ate, combed wool, slaughtered and danced the chain dance for days to keep blood flowing through the bitter cold. It is in this farmhouse, beneath its hulking, fire-singed beams, that Eysturoy encourages me to take in the smell of a grind knife, and says pointedly, ''This is not a place for gold and silver. There is nothing that glitters in this house.''As we're preparing to leave, we run into Joannes Patursson, whose family has lived in the house and on its surrounding farmstead through 17 generations. This fact, so astounding to visitors, remains wholly unimpressive to him. ''I don't think of it much,'' he says, leaning on the bumper of his pickup. His young sons run out of the truck and chase each other toward the house. ''Jah, jah, that is Generation 18.'' Will they grow and farm the land, as Joannes has? ''Maybe. They're still boys. You never know.'' How did the land stay intact for so long? And here I learn the most incredible fact about the scarcely credible Faroese: they have retained the custom of primogeniture. Leaseholds are impartible -- that is, if you are the eldest son, you get everything, and if you are a younger son, you get nothing but screwed. ''You can't split it up, or else you destroy it,'' Eysturoy says, gesturing to the farmstead.A helicopter from one of the offshore rigs suddenly judders by. ''Maybe in the future we will find a well, get some oil,'' says Patursson, the most deeply phlegmatic man alive, with a shrug. ''The Shetlanders themselves did not benefit from it.'' He looks up to the sky and sniffs. It has done nothing but rain since I arrived, but he says, ''Tomorrow it will be clear.'' A heavy downpour continued through the following morning. And then, just as Patursson said it would, the mist lightened and turned to fleecy strands, backed by merciful patches of blue.The coastal village of Tjornuvik is a small cluster of timber houses with a population of about 70. It lies snugly slotted in the hollow of a massive glacial bowl, facing an equally massive ocean channel formed out of an Ice Age fjord. The setting is almost laughably sublime. Hulking mountains shelter the channel, which funnels a roaring surf right up to the village's front edge. In choral reply, waterfalls cascade down from the high escarpment behind the village. Out in the distance loom Risin and Kellingin, the two most iconic sea stacks in the Faroe Islands, known as ''the witch'' and ''the giant.'' (As legend has it, the two ne'er-do-wells were towing the Faroes from Norway to Iceland when the sun came up, and they turned to stone.)Once a year, on a Saturday in early fall, well-heeled professionals make the hour's drive from Torshavn to Tjornuvik for the Stakksdagur, the festal day that inaugurates the community's slaughtering season. In spring, a handful of rams are abandoned to the most remote corner of the village commons, to roam wild over the summer. Come autumn, the village men don traditional Faroese caps, sing traditional Faroese hymns and then, carrying seven-foot spiked wooden fence poles, make the punishing mountain hike to fetch the rams. The men build a makeshift pen from the poles, into which they herd the panicked animals, who are hiked back down the mountain and, with much fanfare, into the village. There they are slaughtered and put up for auction.The year before my visit had marked a milestone: the first woman was allowed to join the Stakksdagur. This year, I will be its first weak-ankled vegetarian. The leader of our party is a young man named Jogvan, whose family has farmed and shepherded in Tjornuvik for generations. Jogvan is about 30, with jet-black hair and a pair of black swoosh eyebrows set atop a rectangular face. ''You like American football,'' Jogvan says cheerily. ''We, we like collecting sheep.''After a round of hymning, a group of about 30 of us ascend to the tottering uppermost heights of a headland, then descend, fully off-trail, into the massive inner rim of a neighboring cirque. The Faroese, it goes without saying, are experienced hikers, as measured by the near total absence, even after hours of precipitous climbing, of dirt anywhere above the sole of their boots. My jeans, meanwhile, are quickly mud-spackled up to the thigh. The hike is exhausting, and I lag badly.After crossing a long alpine meadow, we finally arrive at a cliff edge suspended over the sea. Karis, the pioneering suffragette from the previous year, kindly hikes alongside me. ''So where are the rams?'' I ask, and she laughs. Karis, who looks to be in her early 20s and has hennaed hair and blue-saucer eyes, points out to the water. Hundreds of feet offshore, rising hundreds of feet out of the surf, sits a grass-topped sea stack. ''You're joking.'' Karis shakes her head solemnly and laughs again. The sea stack is reachable only by a crude trolley of a welded aluminum chair rigged up with pulleys on a ropeway suspended 400 feet above roiling whitecaps. We will have to tow ourselves across the chasm, two at a time, and make our high-wire return with rams on board. ''We all have to die sometime,'' Karis says, and I understand perfectly. The spirit of Ove Joensen is everywhere in the Faroes.Crossing to and from the sea stack goes off without a hitch. The return hike is less difficult, and I fall in with Jonhedin, a native of Tjornuvik who now works as a jack-of-all-trades (a journalist, D.J., teacher and, of course, shepherd) in Torshavn. ''My grandparents would say to me, 'You romanticize village life. We were poor. We owned a quarter of a cow,' '' says Jonhedin, who loves Tjornuvik but refuses to sentimentalize it. ''They were tenant farmers. They lived off of land they didn't own.''Later, Jonhedin and I stand together in a makeshift basement slaughterhouse. (Every house in Tjornuvik and most village houses in the Faroes have such an abattoir. ''We live with death, here in the Faroes,'' he says, fully aware of his double entendre.) Here the first ram of the season will be slaughtered. A cartridge gun drives a bolt into the ram's brain, shuddering its body, and then its throat is slit. I've never seen a slaughter, and I watch intently. Blood pours down from the opened throat. The ram kicks and kicks, and death spreads through its body. The blood falls into a bucket, and the bucket is stirred continuously, to prevent clotting, so it can be used later for sausage. ''We use every part of the ram except for the feet and part of the stomach,'' Jonhedin tells me as he holds out the stirrer. The blood clots instantly, and looks like freshly pulped raspberries.This ram had grazed in the wild for six months. All the water it consumed came from sea breezes and wet grass, so there's little fat between its dermis and its tissue. To skin the animal without breaking its hide, a very large man in a blue rubber apron and rubber boots, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, repeatedly drives his hand up into the carcass, both with great force and great care. The village elders look on, goading him with clucks. A father holds up his toddler son to afford him a better view. Between strokes, the man plunges his hands into a bucket of cold water and swigs from a schnapps bottle, then sets upon the ram again, his entire body torquing like a Greco-Roman wrestler's. Finally, the hide separates and -- success! -- the carcass is laid on a dressing table, severed hooves in the air, its hypodermis an unbroken white balloon. The chest cavity is opened, the organs carefully removed, the stomach pumped with water and lanced. The waft of cut grass instantly fills the room.Over coffee in the kitchen of Jogvan's in-laws, a small group gathers to discuss the day's events. The rams have come in light this year. Jonhedin blames global warming. ''There were fewer sand eels this year,'' he explains. ''The puffins eat fewer sand eels, they fertilize the grass less, the sheep weigh 10 pounds less.'' The conversation drifts away from the Stakksdagur. ''There is a rumor,'' says Jogvan. ''Someone at the airport says the drilling crew ordered a case of Champagne to be choppered out to the rig.'' A round of slow nods. The men of Tjornuvik are convinced that the Faroe Islands, should they discover oil, will do with its riches what Tjornuvik would: create a giant community development fund. Jah, jah, a development fund. More careful nods. Then Jogvan says, ''Of course, I'd like to buy a Humvee, and all that.'' Laughter, as Jonhedin adds, ''A solid-gold Humvee. Now, can you imagine Jogvan driving up the mountain in that?''That night I call John Eysturoy to tell him about my remarkable final day in the Faroe Islands. Jah, jah: he had already heard.A week later, at home in Brooklyn, idling in front of my computer, I Google ''Faroes,'' ''discovery'' and ''oil.'' The story I click through to reads: ''Drilling by Statoil off the Faroe Islands has been completed. No commercially viable oil or gas volumes were found.''ESSENTIALS: FAROE ISLANDSGETTING THERE: The easiest way to arrive is through Copenhagen, from which there are several daily flights on Atlantic Airways (www.atlantic.fo). Atlantic also flies from Reykjavik, Iceland; London; and (summer only) Aberdeen, Scotland.LAY OF THE LAND: It's easiest to get around the islands by car and ferry. Most visitors base themselves on Streymoy, which is home to the capital city, Torshavn. Of the remaining 17 islands, those most worth visiting are the beautiful Suduroy; Mykines, for bird watching; Eysturoy, for its charming fishing villages; and Koltur, which is inhabited by one couple and has medieval ruins (you can reach it only by an inexpensive Atlantic Airways helicopter flight).HOTELS: Hotel Foroyar Pleasant hilltop property, overlooking the harbor and the city, with a good restaurant.

But South Gong and Drum Lane (Nan Luoguxiang) is an exception. Near the central lakes, the 700-year-old hutong is a bit of authentic bohemia in an otherwise Starbucks-saturated central city.Mike MeyerOne of the lane's pioneers, Pass By Bar (No. 108; 011-86-10-8403-8004), was opened in 1999 by Xiao Biar, whose shaved head and Coke-bottle specs make him instantly recognizable on his bar-stool perch. The original local clientele has given way to affluent Chinese and foreign hipsters drawn to the open courtyard seating and the soundtrack of Tibetan drums. Pass By's success has spawned a sequel, the posh Pass By Restaurant (1) (No. 114; 011-86-10-6400-6868; entrees $10 to $15), which serves salads, fresh fish and perhaps the capital's only veal piccata.As a planned showcase for the Games, the lane was repaved last year with gray bricks, and storefronts were ordered repainted -- with one xception, the hulking concrete Central Academy of Drama (2) (No. 39; 011-86-10-6403-5626), which stages nighttime performances. (Check the signs, posted in English.) Take in the youthful scene at the nameless (and phoneless) restaurant (3) opposite the school's gate, where students congregate over bowls of hand-pulled noodles. Though there are dozens of newer restaurants and bars, two stalwarts continue to impress. Drum and Gong (4) (No. 102; 011-86-10-8402-4729; entrees $3 to $10) serves spicy Sichuan-style dishes, and across the lane, Here Cafe (5) (No. 97; 011-86-10-8401-4246) has plush sofas, freshly ground coffee and free Wi-Fi.Unlike on the hutongs surrounding the central lake district, you won't find tchotchkes like cloisonn&#233; eggs and stuffed Olympic mascots for sale here. Plastered T-Shirts (6) (No. 61; 011-86-10-1348-884-8855) specializes in tees with the logos of Beijing's taxis and subway, and Yanjing beer. Also check out Minzu Feng (No. 56; 011-86-10-8205-0226) for folk-inspired women's clothing and Jmax (No. 17-4; 011-86-134-6666-2024) for handmade silver necklaces.Architecture buffs should head 100 yards east on Juer Hutong (Chrysanthemum Lane) to see its World Habitat Award-winning housing project, which used modern materials to reproduce traditional courtyard living. Though Beijing's lanes are being replaced by car-friendly streets and high-rises, the design was praised locally, staking a claim for responsible development in a 21st-century city.The Remix</text></article><article id="1835295"><summary>Hotels that have enticed hot new chefs to open restaurants outside New York City noted; photos (M)</summary><text>When the Ritz-Carlton, Grand Cayman went shopping for a chef three years ago, it didn't go after a brand-name toque with an overcooked empire.

(Ripert is set to open in the Washington, D.C., Ritz-Carlton this summer.)Meanwhile, other hotels are scooping up New York chefs just building their brands: the W hotel in Dallas (www.whotels.com) teamed up with Tom Colicchio of Craft last summer; Caesars Palace (www.caesars.com) lured the Rao's owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. westward in January; and this fall, Miami's Gansevoort South (www.gansevoortsouth.com) will install a version of Philippe Chow's Philippe.Looking outside New York, the Regent South Beach (www.theregentsouthbeach.com) brought in Govind Armstrong in December to reprise his Los Angeles hot spot Table 8. And the LXR chain (www.luxuryresorts.com), which has been buying up United States and Caribbean hotels, went to England for fresh talent. In bringing Gordon Ramsay to its London hotels in New York and Los Angeles, the group also secured the Ramsay prot&#233;g&#233;e Angela Hartnett, the chef at the Connaught in London. She'll open Cielo at LXR's Boca Raton Resort and Club, her first restaurant outside her native country, this spring.''The heirloom crop of chefs is pretty expensive and spread pretty thin,'' says the restaurant-chef matchmaker Clark Wolf (who helped bring Ducasse to Las Vegas) of the trend. ''It's a fine line. You want someone who's up-and-coming but also well known enough to be a draw.''Jay Cheshes</text></article><article id="1835297"><summary>Sampling of tapas bars in Madrid's Las Letras neighborhood; photo (S)</summary><text>Tapas-bar-hopping is a favorite sport in Madrid, and the Las Letras neighborhood is the place to join the game.

If you weren't gambling, you weren't losing to the house, and this left casinos little incentive to wine and dine you. Today, of course, all that's changed: the marriage of gambling to dining, shopping and culture has glamorized the casino experience, and over-the-top has become the new run-of-the-mill. Americans, for their part, have embraced the highbrow-lowbrow mishmash of places like Las Vegas and Connecticut's Mohegan Sun, and now a little roulette between shopping at Prada and dinner at Thomas Keller's Bouchon seems like light entertainment on par with seeing Celine Dion. It's a phenomenon that has proved highly lucrative (Ceasars Forum in Las Vegas is North America's highest-grossing shopping area per square foot) and easily exportable, thereby reshaping not only the culture of gaming but also how and where we travel.Call it the Vegas effect: as casinos become one-stop purveyors of vacation pleasure, plans for destination gaming are springing up worldwide, in places as disparate as the Kazakh steppe; Manchester, England; Indiana, where the French Lick Casino and Resort just finished a $400 million makeover; and, most notably, Singapore and Macao. Gambling is both wildly popular and illegal in mainland China, and so Chinese tourists are celebrating their growing purchasing power by spending it abroad. Macao, an island west of Hong Kong, has already surpassed Las Vegas in gambling revenue; a Wynn and MGM Grand will join the Sands Macau, along with a 10.5-million-square-foot Venetian on the Cotai Strip, a manufactured island that will eventually have an A-list of luxury hotels, including a Four Seasons and a St. Regis. And in notoriously buttoned-up Singapore, a $3.6 billion Sands complex will open in 2009. ''The wealth effect is just starting in Asia,'' notes Gerald Celente of the Trends Research Institute, ''and with newfound wealth comes a drunkenness of invincibility.''Perhaps the most notable feature of the new gaming is that it appears self-perpetuating. The more vacationers travel to Macao, the more they'll want to visit Vegas the next year and Singapore the year after. So too will destinations not built around gambling jump into the gaming mainstream: this spring, the Cove, the upscale offshoot of the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas, will offer cards and craps by the pool. For the current casino boom, a rising tide will lift all bets.David Haskell</text></article><article id="1835304"><summary>Toby Cecchini article on visit to Guadalupe Valley, Mex, to sample region's world-class wines; photos (L)</summary><text>On a trip to sample mezcal in Oaxaca three years ago I encountered a restaurateur who kept imploring me to try his house wines, produced by a friend in Baja. I managed to stave him off for a week, indulging in Negra Modelos instead, until the last night, when he uncorked two bottles of red and I was made to walk the plank. The water, it turned out, was shockingly fine. After sampling a complex, silky cabernet-merlot and then a jamlike tempranillo-garnacha blend, I had to pick my jaw off the ground. Why weren't these available, or even known, in the States? He laughed proudly and said: ''There's very little and we drink them all here, and happily. What do we need to send them north for?''Since the wines weren't going to come to me, I figured I would head south. After a flight to San Diego, I steeled myself for the ugly clutter of the Southern California freeway leading to the border and the snarl of barely signed roads through Tijuana. A mere hour south of San Diego, however, the commercial roadside jumble vanishes, and the Pacific looms off to your right from a high mountain vista, placidly gorgeous with sunset hues glinting across odd circular forms floating just off the coast, which turn out to be tuna farms. As you turn onto Route 3 (La Ruta del Vino), which runs straight through the 14-mile-long Guadalupe Valley, Mexico's premier wine region, you exhale as the world changes drastically in your favor. Farmers on horseback lope along roads surfaced with spent grape pulp, while skinny cows nose cactuses.Protected from Baja's ferocious aridity by mountain ranges on three sides, which cup the Pacific's breezes, the valley forms a microclimate perfect for growing wine grapes, along with olive trees and an abundance of other fruit crops. Today there are roughly two dozen wineries in the region, but wine has been produced here since the conquistadors introduced it in the 16th century. In the mid-17th-century, the Spanish crown outlawed Mexican wine in order to protect sales at home. Dominican missionaries later took up the grape, only to lose their vineyards when the War of Reform ended in 1857. Production began again, incredibly enough, with the arrival of the Molokans, a group of religious pacifists who fled czarist Russia for Baja in 1904. Since then, three huge producers, Santo T&#243;mas, Domecq and L.A. Cetto, have dominated the scene, though none of their wines have achieved any particular distinction.In the early '90s, however, Hugo d'Acosta, a Bordeaux-trained oenologist from Mexico City who had been working at Santo T&#243;mas, stepped out on his own. Believing that the region was falling short of its potential, he spearheaded the small-production movement, improving quality by targeting specific plots and limiting vine yield to concentrate the fruit. He also employed cold fermentation, which helped to preserve the wine's more ephemeral aromatics.The Guadalupe Valley today is often compared to Napa 60 years ago, and if so, d'Acosta would be its Robert Mondavi, and then some. His influence and ubiquity in the region are almost Kurtz-like: his first winery, Casa de Piedra, a small barn constructed from recycled materials by his architect brother, Alejandro, produces the rich, saturated wines that established the benchmark for the region; he founded l'Escuelita, a nonprofit winemaking school in nearby El Porvenir; he recently opened 623, a sleek wine bar/restaurant in the port town of Ensenada; and he is just finishing a much more ambitious winery (again the work of Alejandro) called Paralelo. He also happens to be a consultant, if not the actual winemaker, at most of the area's best wineries.Antonio Badan at Rancho Mogor-Badan is another influential vintner. He and his sister Natalia live on the farm their parents, a Swiss-French couple, settled in the 1950s. On Wednesdays, Natalia sets up an impromptu market off of their porch, selling organic produce. The wines, however, are the real draw. The red, a tightly wound cabernet-merlot blend simply called Mogor-Badan, was the most elegant wine I tasted on my trip, with vibrant fruit held by a rock-solid structure. Their white, a pure chasselas, is made from an unusual grape seldom found outside Switzerland. In this incarnation it made for a light, dry wine that was still dense with spice: mustard seed and fennel.The Badans typify the broad spectrum of community-minded pilgrims and wine-industry colonists who have settled here. Antonio is an oceanographer by trade; Natalia, who has helped to organize protests against large-scale intrusions into the valley, particularly heavy industry and housing subdivisions, stresses the perils of growth. She warns, ''We have to keep the paesaje for agriculture, to use the good soil for olive oil, honey and wine, not for people's vacation houses.''Two aspects of the landscape may inadvertently help safeguard the Guadalupe Valley's idyll: the roads and the water. With the exception of Route 3, the valley's main road, the terrain is rocky, making even a short trip a dusty, rattling journey. As d'Acosta slyly explains: ''Good roads, bad tourists. Bad roads, good tourists.'' (The maxim seemed to hold, as the only other travelers I met were curious Californian vintners down for a peek.) Water has long been a bugaboo here. The water table that feeds the area is slightly saline. At times of high use, this can be evident in the wines. All of them carry a slight trace of saltiness, and in the best it can ground the fruit nicely. But as d'Acosta says: ''Because of the salt, you can't produce well in bulk here. Only low yields of solid fruit will balance it.''Backing up his words magnificently are the dense reds that d'Acosta makes for Adobe Guadalupe, a winery and inn run by Tru and Don Miller that serves both functions with equal grace. The place is small and intimate, with an open kitchen and dogs bounding about. The Millers, like Eileen and Phil Gregory, who run the charming La Villa del Valle Inn, are on intimate terms with most of the winemakers and are generous with their knowledge, crucial in an area where there are few actual tasting rooms. Over a dinner of local shellfish soup and lamb in Adobe Guadalupe's dining room, Tru poured the 2002 Gabriel, a seamless Bordeaux blend with an uncanny nose of mint chocolate. As Don poured their other four reds (all named for archangels), he spoke of how, having reached his desired maximum production of 6,000 cases, he sells everything in Mexico, mainly to restaurants in the capital.A reliable shortcut to the region's best wines is to pay a visit to the two restaurants that also serve as the region's social hubs. Laja, the local culinary temple, has been called the French Laundry of the Guadalupe Valley. And at the hallowed, wine-soaked Thursday-night romp at the bistro Manzanilla in Ensenada, every face in the valley is there, three or four languages are slipped in and out of, and all bring in a bottle or two of something special they've made. Armando, the impeccably turned-out bartender, blinks unperturbedly as a conversation between two young winemakers about the time share of a French oak barrel vies with the clamor of other guests trying to balance empty mezcal bottles on their chins.Though the atmosphere is welcoming, no one here is eager to spread the secret of this nascent scene. With the interest of the corporate wine world looming, the valley is at a crossroads. Still, the region's rusticity and the winemakers' proprietary stance may preserve it for a bit longer. Jos&#233; Luis Durand, a producer transplanted from Chile, explains: ''This is our own thing. It's a region where it's very slow, where you can see the grass growing. We are the ones creating our own history here.''Essentials Guadalupe Valley, MexicoGETTING THERE Fly to San Diego and then drive south across the border toward Tecate to reach Route 3, the valley's main thoroughfare.

Called ''The Age of Bronze,'' it is by Rodin and happens to be the oldest piece in the collection, a life-size, perfectly formed male nude in a pose that is both pensive and slightly pained. It is supposed to depict, according to the director of the museum, Steven A. Nash, ''the dawning of a new age of self-awareness, or self-consciousness.'' Distinguishing between the two has long been a psychic struggle here, though the unqualified success of the Nasher itself -- a gift to Dallas from the shopping-mall magnate and local philanthropist Raymond D. Nasher, housed in a flawless, quietly self-confident building by Renzo Piano -- suggests that Dallas might finally be getting there. The city seems willing to throw off its long-held infatuation with glitz and glamour, while remaining obsessed with maintaining a reputation for impeccable, indisputable good taste.As Mayor Laura Miller put it in ''Dallas: Where Dreams Come True,'' a self-congratulatory brochure, ''Dallas is, once again, in the midst of a new beginning -- a magnificent renaissance.'' These days, you can't visit the city without someone buttonholing you to chant a mantra of big-time architecture: a new opera center by Norman Foster, a new theater by Rem Koolhaas, a proposed bridge spanning the Trinity River by Santiago Calatrava. These buildings will take their place alongside a Latino Cultural Center by Ricardo Legorreta, a symphony hall by I. M. Pei, Philip Johnson's Crescent Court complex and a new development by Ross Perot Jr., near the American Airlines basketball arena, which looks like something out of ''Blade Runner'' on a sunny day. And three of the city's biggest art patrons -- the Hoffman, Rachofsky and Rose families -- have donated their world-class contemporary collections to the once struggling Dallas Museum of Art. ''You can't believe you're in Dallas!'' a friend of mine and longtime resident said.So what if, last year, The Dallas Morning News issued a bleak report on the state of crime, schools and growth? (Sample text: ''Dallas calls itself 'the city that works.' Dallas is wrong.'') The city's natural optimism dominates in the enormous cranes that bob and weave all over the city center, promising a new Ritz-Carlton, a new Mandarin Oriental and assorted high-rise luxury condos. Only the new W hotel, with a 25-foot mobile of tiny toy cowboys, cowgirls, mustangs and cows, seems interested in honoring the past. Dallas these days wants to be seen as a sophisticated destination for art, culture and, of course, business.Maybe, then, it wasn't so shocking that a cadre of Southern Methodist University professors protested the location of the George W. Bush presidential library on campus. But few who've been around Texas for any length of time can't help but be surprised that Dallas has learned to stop snubbing Fort Worth, its more secure and deeply resented cousin, so that the two cities can join forces in creating one whopping destination for art and architecture fans. As the Morning News architecture critic David Dillon told me, ''The city is really coming into its own.'' Particularly when considered with Louis Kahn's Kimbell and Tadao Ando's Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, Dallas is, in a way, he said, ''a place you can't not go.''In other words, you really can't associate Dallas with big, brassy blondes or J. R. Ewing anymore, much less with Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination. Nor can you equate it with the stuffy, post-oil-bust, shame-cycle city of the late 1980s and '90s. Dallas hasn't lost its passion for getting it right -- this is still a city where a fashion stylist can be described in a news story, without irony, as an ''avowed minimalist'' -- but the earnestness that can easily be mistaken for pretension has softened. ''It's learning to loosen up,'' Dillon said, with just a hint of doubt in his voice.I lived in Dallas from 1988 to 1991, on a street called Mercedes, which always struck me, and anyone else familiar with Dallas's ambitions, as fitting. I was newly married to a busy husband, had a job that encouraged travel, and wasn't terribly enthusiastic about settling in. Texans split hairs about the state's major cities in a way outsiders do not. I am from San Antonio and had been living in Austin and, before that, Houston. Dallas had always seemed to me too Midwestern, too conservative and far too orderly and uptight. Still, I fell in love with the tiny brick bungalow we bought in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood and taught myself to be patient with our 90-something neighbor, who told us she had ridden in covered wagons. My husband and I contented ourselves with eating square-shaped pizza in the dark, '40s-era dining room at Campisi's and the mealy corn dogs at the state fair; we inspected the assassination site and checked out Southfork. In other words, we struck a pose that we were in Dallas but not of Dallas, though on special occasions we made forays to the brooding opulence of the Mansion on Turtle Creek or the chic Routh Street Caf&#233; (now closed), where the chefs Dean Fearing and Stephan Pyles created New Southwestern concoctions like lobster tacos with jicama salad or catfish mousse with crayfish sauce.In my spare time, I shopped. I do not mean that every once in a while I ventured into the original Neiman Marcus downtown or made the monthly pilgrimage to the antiques sale at Fair Park. I mean that Dallas unleashed in me a near constant mania to discover my best (looking) self. Even 20 years ago, the ways to do so in Dallas were myriad. I hate to count the days I wandered, in my flower-girl garb, from the downtown Neiman's to the Stanley Korshak at the Crescent Court, trying on lipsticks, blush and designer clothes I couldn't possibly afford, helped along by saleswomen who spoke to me kindly and treated me gently, like I was a hopeless refugee from the Planet of Terrible Taste. I bought a Perry Ellis gown on sale for what was then a breathtaking $300 at NorthPark Center and exchanged a wink with Calvin Klein at the Highland Park Village shopping center when he appeared for a trunk show at his first free-standing eponymous store.As they say, when in Rome. Yes, there were major cultural institutions in town, but I understood then as I understand now that the real works of art in Dallas are those created and inspired by the retailers, particularly Stanley Marcus, whose spirit remains as venerated in Dallas as the Buddha's in Tibet. At the heart of it all -- this zeal for glamour and sophistication, a supreme faith in the transcendent power of surfaces -- is a Texan's pride and a Texan's insecurity: you don't leave the house without looking your best, because you never know whom you might see, and who might want to find you lacking. (It isn't just the Cowboys who know that the best defense is a good offense.)In other words, I made my peace with Dallas on Dallas's terms. I know in retrospect that there were plenty of Dallas residents who left their houses without being properly turned out, who took their kids to Little League and soccer practice instead of shopping malls. But I wasn't one of them. I had succumbed to the local fever, and it didn't break the day my husband came home and asked how I'd feel about moving back to Houston. It was only months later, after I'd caught our new Houston neighbors snickering at my color-coordinated linens, my floral arrangement and my chicken salad with too many neo-Southwestern ingredients, that I was cured. I was way south of the Trinity again, and it was time to let go.I hadn't been to Dallas for any length of time when I visited recently, and my first indication that things had changed was when I spied the jewelry being raffled off at the Nasher Sculpture Center's New Year's Eve benefit. The stones on the white gold necklace were not small by any standard -- the piece was billed in the party program as ''a stunning 2 1/2-carat diamond necklace'' valued at $5,900 -- but it didn't look like something J. R. Ewing or, for that matter, H. L. Hunt would have given any self-respecting mistress. It was understated. (This was a town, after all, where a father hired a three-ring circus complete with elephants for his daughter's debutante party, long before MTV's ''My Super Sweet 16.'') The inside of the Nasher party tent looked like something from the Snow Queen -- all shimmering silver and snowy white. The dinner chairwoman Heidi Dillon wore big blond hair with her silver sequined gown, but her young son was also in attendance, in a tux and matching silver sneakers, which dialed the whole thing back a bit. Some of the male guests weren't even in black tie, another sign that the city's days of trying too hard were perhaps numbered.If anything was missing from the Dallas I remembered, it was that. Earlier, my husband and I had checked into the boutique Hotel ZaZa, just across the freeway from the city's arts district. Boutique hotels speak to the Dallas soul -- they're trendy and exclusive -- but the ZaZa also refuses to take itself too seriously. It is like a cross between a villa in Cannes, a West Hollywood hot spot and a zendo. There is a sun-washed pool in designer-approved Mediterranean hues; theme suites (the Rock Star, the Last Czar, the Crouching Tiger), some of which are bigger than my 2,000-square-foot home; moodily darkened hallways decorated, this being fashion-crazed Dallas, with Helmut Newton photographs; and pink thong underwear inscribed with the hotel's name available for purchase from a glass case in the lobby. (Bible Belt Dallas always had a thing for illicit sex.)Our non-themed room had the requisite flat-screen TV and a frosted-glass window between the bedroom and shower with an inscription debatably but frequently attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson about success (''To leave the world a bit better / whether by a healthy child, / a garden patch / or a redeemed social condition, / . . . This is to have success''). We had a terrific view of guests arriving and departing in their Porsches, Hummers and BMWs, burdened with shopping bags from Neiman's, Barneys, etc., and I wondered whether the hotel's designers had indulged a taste for irony not commonly associated with Dallas. Then I found the tooth whitener for sale on the minibar, and remembered where I was.Maybe it was out of a desire for preemptive serenity that we had dined the night before at York Street. Dallas has always been a wonderful food town, somewhat surprising in a place where well-cut clothing is de rigueur. (Dean Fearing's departure from the Mansion to create his own restaurant in the new Ritz-Carlton was treated in Dallas with the gravity of a Cold War defection.) The d&#233;cor of a restaurant here is almost as important as its food: an impressive, high-end place like Local is so severely spare it approaches self-parody, while the Latin homestyle La Duni has expensive toiletries and a wide-screen TV in the restroom. On my visit, the latter was tuned to the Cowboys game.But maybe it is indicative of the city's semi-relaxation that York Street, its best restaurant, is tucked into a tiny space in the cozy east Dallas neighborhood known as Lakewood. We arrived straight from the highway, and no one looked askance at our casual attire; the room was full of happy diners of every sociological-economic-ethnic stripe, a vast change from two decades ago, when the only people in the city's best restaurants were overdressed and white. There were social rituals here, but gracious ones: the manager brought us tiny sips of sherry, tangy olives and warmed towels by way of greeting. From the chef Sharon Hage's simple, market-fresh menu, we enjoyed a sprightly parsnip and truffle soup, tender pork chops and roast chicken, along with homemade gingersnap ice cream. Everyone seemed to know everyone else -- you almost expected to see plates passed from table to table. Because we had arrived late, my husband missed out on his first choice, a monkfish di Parma. ''Call ahead next time and we'll be sure to have it for you,'' our waiter said, wishing us good night. Whether this was the new new Dallas or a Dallas I had never bothered to know, it was nice to feel so at home.There is always something disorienting about returning as a visitor to a place you used to live, and this trip was no different. There was a part of me that marveled at all the changes in Dallas: the new light-rail system that ran by our old house, the new Uptown/West Village area, complete with low-rise condos, sleek restaurants and coffee houses, all in an area comprising no more than six square blocks. (''Dallas has discovered the pedestrian,'' cracked my friend Skip, a longtime Dallasite.) Even the entrance ramps on the Central Expressway had been improved, meaning drivers could merge without the acceleration skills and/or the death wish of Evel Knievel.Even so, I approached my sentimental favorite, NorthPark Center, with trepidation. I shouldn't have worried: the Nasher family artwork collection, including Andy Warhol, Jim Dine and Frank Stella, was still showing Neiman's in its best light, along with newer stores like Barneys New York, Nordstrom, Oscar de la Renta and Intermix. (Khajak Keledjian, a co-owner of Intermix, used to watch ''Dallas'' as a kid in Beirut, so when it came time to expand, he had a soft spot for Texas.) I was greeted like a long-lost relation. Way back in the '60s, Joan Didion described a woman she had met in Dallas who was ''charming and attractive'' and ''accustomed to the hospitality and hypersensitivity of Texas.'' That's still true at NorthPark, and it's still true of the city at large: Dallas needs to be appreciated by the larger world, a characteristic that will always separate it from bigger, burlier American cities.At the same time, few big cities lavish so much attention on its wealthiest citizens. It wasn't surprising to me, for instance, that Whole Foods Market chose to improve its North Dallas store by adding both a concierge and a 4,500-square-foot wellness spa. Likewise, to the south at Forty Five Ten, Dallas's toniest lifestyle emporium -- Dries Van Noten, Givenchy, Marni -- the ambience is customized for the knowledgeable, if casual, rich. ''We're trying to do something very chic but very friendly,'' the co-owner Brian Bolke told me. ''Our staff wears flip-flops in the summer.''This is so not Dallas,'' said Darren, the barista at the Nodding Dog cafe in Oak Cliff. When I asked why this old suburb shouldn't be considered a part of Dallas, he explained that it was ''funky, laid-back and not pretentious.'' This is the way Oak Cliff plays down-home Brooklyn (okay, the Brooklyn of 20 years ago) to Dallas's high-toned Manhattan: despite several promised rebirths -- and this one seems to be taking -- it has retained and even improved upon its scruffy, laissez-faire spirit. A separate city until 1903, it has had its issues with crime and poverty; the bank robber Clyde Barrow is buried in Oak Cliff and Lee Harvey Oswald lived here. Like Brooklyn, Oak Cliff has opened its heart to all comers, from poor and middle-class African-Americans to gays to Hispanic immigrants. Because the area possesses some of the city's best housing stock, it's also become a seductive venue for gentrifiers. In Kessler Park, there are mansions almost as fine as any on Dallas's tony Swift Avenue and tiny turreted brick cottages similar to those in Lakewood. Oak Cliff even has its very own boutique hotel, the Belmont, which has rooms with deep soaking tubs and Kiehl's bath products.The part of Oak Cliff that has best resolved the Dallas/not Dallas conundrum, however, is the Bishop Arts District, a collection of small restored shops and office buildings from the 1920s that includes the Nodding Dog. Oak Cliff was once the place where you could find the best chicken-fried steak on the planet, at the much-mourned Gennie's Bishop Grill; now there is Hattie's, which serves pulled pork over garlic grits and fried green tomatoes on white tablecloths with an accompanying wine list. Even more to the point is Tillman's Roadhouse. Known for 14 years as Tillman's Corner, it has recently received a makeover; the menu includes truffled popcorn and venison Frito pie, and the interior has damask walls, crystal chandeliers, carved deer heads and the occasional showing of ''Giant'' on the lounge wall. This is small-town Texas and, at the same time, a reasonable, updated and upgraded facsimile. Most of the people there looked happy to have it both ways.Maybe that is the secret of this new new Dallas. For the first time it seems possible to have Rem Koolhaas and chicken-fried steak and Givenchy and flip-flops without the accompanying angst, that longtime local fear of being branded a hick by outsiders. If I needed more proof of this self-acceptance, I found it late on New Year's Eve at the Nasher, when dessert was served and all the women got golden eggs topped with tiny rhinestones alongside their chocolate towers. In a hushed voice, the M.C. asked us not to crack the egg until he gave the signal. Then he explained: inside one of the eggs was a Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle ring with no less than half a dozen round diamonds. ''Please wait until we give the signal,'' he begged the crowd, but just when he finished his plea, a whoop went up in the center of the room, because a 90-year-old patron, Betty Blake, had already cracked open her egg to find the ring.''She's a little hard of hearing,'' someone near me said, but I didn't believe it for a minute.ESSENTIALS DALLASHOTELS: The city's two top in-town luxury properties, Rosewood's Mansion on Turtle Creek (888-767-3966; www.mansiononturtlecreek.com; doubles from $295) and the Hotel Crescent Court (888-767-3966; www.crescent court.com; doubles from $275), will be joined within a year by a new Ritz-Carlton (www.ritzcarlton.com) and a Mandarin Oriental (www.mandarin-oriental.com).

Where's that? I wondered. I was born in Paris but had never heard of Le Perche, nor had any of my relatives in France. It's two hours from Paris, I was told, in lower Normandy, not far from Chartres. ''It has glorious manoirs and chateaus and is famous for its Percheron,'' Mich&#232;le wrote to me, ''the noblest, absolutely most gorgeous horses in the world.''We drove down from Paris, past Chartres, through La Beauce, a flat plain with Kansas-like fields of wheat. Then suddenly, as we began to climb, the landscape changed radically; billboards dropped away, and the highway splintered into country roads that wound through brilliant yellow and deep green fields. All around were intermingling patches of woodland, heath, barley and rapeseed fields, tall hedgerows and orchards. Manoirs with fairy-tale towers hung on the side of the hills. Brooks meandered through the meadows where, sure enough, stood those majestic horses of Lancelotian stature, flashing silver in the light.Mich&#232;le and Alain's house was in R&#233;malard, a village with a 12th-century church on the Huisne River. As we drove through some of Le Perche's dozen villages (and many more tiny communes), here and there were ocher stone houses with red-tiled roofs and herds of white cows on dazzling green pastures. We wound along roads lined with concave hedges so tall they formed soft green tunnels. I felt like Alice going down a rabbit hole.By the end of our first day, we'd fallen in love with Le Perche. By the end of the second day, we'd seen a long stone farmhouse built in the 18th century next to two long stone barns. Near the house were apple, pear and plum trees, and out back were oaks, then fields of golden wheat and corn. It was for sale. By the end of the weekend, we were the owners of a farmhouse in Condeau, a village that three days prior I hadn't even known existed.Le Perche inspires people to heroic gestures. Twenty-eight years ago, three men -- Jacques Dussutour, Patrick Hoguet and Jean-Claude Lenoir -- began petitioning the French government to grant the region the status of Le Parc Naturel R&#233;gional. In 1998 this status was officially granted. The government has since designated 45 such areas across the country in order to manage natural resources, develop the regions' social and economic potential, and control urban sprawl. Le Perche had long appealed to the few lucky urban escapees who had heard of it. Soon after it was made a Parc Naturel, Parisians weary of the fashionable scene in popular weekend towns like Deauville arrived and began buying and restoring abandoned farms and chateaus.Six months later, after we were settled into our house, I decided it was time to get out and explore. So I did what any new homeowner would do. I got to know my neighbors.Like Mich&#232;le and Alain, B&#233;atrice Saalburg and her husband came to Le Perche as frazzled city folk on a quest for nature. They bought the 17th-century Ch&#226;teau de Maison Maugis in 1970; a quadruple alley of horse chestnut trees leads to the house, which had been in the same family for 500 years. In her garden, B&#233;atrice grows thyme, mint, hyssop and a variety of vegetables, many of which end up in her atelier, where she teaches botanical painting. Down the road is the exquisite chapel of Saint Nicolas, which holds concerts in the summer. When I asked her husband, a graphic designer, why he came here, his answer was one that I would hear time and again: ''I found a place where I could escape the turmoil of the 20th century, where the landscape was free of all modern trappings. This is not an area invaded by hordes of tourists.''To find out how Le Perche escaped the crush, I paid a visit to the Parc Naturel president Jacques Dussutour, at the Parc headquarters in Le Manoir de Courboyer, near Noc&#233;, a tiny village with flowers everywhere and one excellent restaurant, L'Auberge des 3 J. Dussutour explained that in the early 1900s, Le Perche was a bountiful agricultural region that thrived on the raising of Percheron horses; just prior to World War I, an average of 10,000 Percherons were shipped to the United States every year. But the war and the tractor put an end to the horse business and to hundreds of small farms. By the 1970s, when the highway from Paris to Deauville was completed, bypassing Le Perche entirely, tourism had all but died, building booms took hold elsewhere, and Le Perche was quickly forgotten.''By 1979, we had enough,'' Dussutour said. So he and his colleagues drafted a charter to protect their buildings and forests, promote local artisans and agriculture, and restore tourism. Nearly every commune signed it.The charter has been so successful that agrarian ideals have once again become the driving force of Le Perche. In the heart of Mortagne-au-Perche, the region's second-largest town, new construction must use stone for the walls and tile for roofs pitched at 45 degrees, an expensive proposition that has limited modern buildings and, in turn, helped preserve the integrity of the surrounding 17th-century houses. The town's busy weekly market, too, is much the same as it was centuries ago; only now, the meat and produce are being sold by a younger generation of farmers and artisans who have returned to the land and its customs. On any Saturday, the Place Notre-Dame is swarming with locals -- old folks and couples with babies alike -- examining some prize-winning rabbit or pig before meeting up with friends for broiled boudin and a glass of local hard cider.After spending the afternoon in Mortagne, walking past the building where Henry IV slept and the house of the Counts of Le Perche, I drove about 10 miles to Bell&#234;me, another of Le Perche's larger villages. It sits nobly on a high plateau, behind medieval walls and near the magnificent woods of Reno Valdieu and the Forest of Bell&#234;me. Climbing Rue d'Alen&#231;on past the church of Saint Sauveur, in the heart of old Bell&#234;me, I found Le Comptoir du Porche, a delightful boutique with pottery, jewelry and textiles, and an adjacent tea room and garden serving more than 20 types of tea.Not far from Bell&#234;me is the farm of Le Village, where Laurent Renou raises Percherons on 128 acres. Every year in May at Percheval, the day of the horse, he and other local breeders show their prize steeds in Nogent-le-Rotrou, attracting admirers from all over the region. As Renou waxed poetic about the sweet nature of the Percheron and its contribution to France as far back as the Crusades, I sensed what deep attachment the people of Le Perche have formed to their land. The days of keeping the world on horseback or a hungry France free from want are, of course, gone for good. But somehow Le Perche has come as close to recapturing its past as the 21st century will allow.What the region is most proud of, however, may just be a loaf of bread. The baguette du Perche has been made under the auspices of the Parc Naturel system for the past three years. Every loaf is carefully monitored and bears an official seal. Philippe Gallioz and Jean Larriviere, who both left corporate jobs, first developed the baguette at their 400-year-old mill in Bivilliers. ''What we were looking for,'' Gallioz told me, ''could only be accomplished in an area like Le Perche, which still operates on the criteria of 100 years ago.'' Today about 50 bakers in Le Perche make this fragrant, perfectly crusted bread. And the reigning king of la baguette is David Lambert, whose bakery, Les Flaveurs du Perche, is in Bretoncelles. Lambert is a second-generation baker and one of the new group of Percherons who combines modern marketing ideas with old traditions. Community response to his bread has been so favorable that he built a new wood-fired brick oven and began using a machine that simulates kneading by hand. His output has swelled to more than 1,200 baguettes a week.Similar success has come to Philippe Couvreur, an ebullient 45-year-old who married Fabienne, a Percheronne woman, in 2000. That year, they founded Les Escargots du Perche on their farm in the village of Pr&#233;aux-du-Perche. As I sat with them under one of their towering walnut trees, eating tender, garlicky escargots, Philippe told me the familiar story of his flight from the corporate world to an old farmhouse. He took classes to learn how to raise escargots and ultimately developed an entirely new kind of snail that grows twice as large as and more tender than Burgundy snails -- and in half the time. Soon his farm became the talk of the industry, and with the help of the Parc Naturel, he began marketing p&#226;t&#233;s and ready-to-eat escargots, which he sells to area restaurants at markets in Le Perche and from a boutique on his land. Today Philippe grows more than 400,000 escargots a year and is building a visitors' center for demonstrations and tastings. ''Life is different here,'' Philippe said. ''People care about their neighbors. My friends come on weekends to help me finish the barn. We are a close-knit group, so different from the rest of France.''Still, Philippe worries about the future of small-scale farming in France, as do many of Le Perche's independent growers. I met with Maurice Levier, a fifth-generation farmer who makes an award-winning 25-year-old Calvados and who owns about 1,000 acres of apple orchards and corn and wheat fields. In front of the fireplace at his manoir, Le Grand Brolles, he explained that the region's chief concern is that the European Union has pressured France to accept reduced farm subsidies by 2014. But Levier is optimistic: his two sons decided to return home after college and work on the farm with their father. ''Most of my friends' children feel strongly about the land and Le Perche and return to live here,'' he said. ''They bring modern ideas with them but still have a love of old traditions.'' Like his fellow Percherons, Levier will keep working to protect the marriage of progress and preservation. And in the meantime, he said, ''we will continue to enjoy this beautiful land.''ESSENTIALS: LE PERCHE, FRANCEHOTELS: Ch&#226;teau de Saint Paterne Beautiful chateau hotel.

From the passenger seat of a battered Toyota Land Cruiser, it looked like pure rock pile, on and on, up, down, over. Ahmed Said, my driver and guide, wrestled the wheel like a man engaged, surely and calmly, in a struggle to the death. When at last, after 90 minutes, he stopped and got out, we had traveled perhaps no more than five miles.We stood on a rise overlooking a riverbed rushing with water. The ground underfoot was a rubble of granite boulders and chunks of sharp limestone karst. Small trees -- short and gnarled, resembling mesquite -- surrounded us. Ahmed approached one and pointed to an amber drop of sap oozing from its trunk: the essence of frankincense. Until that moment I'd had no clear idea what exactly frankincense was; nor that it derives from the sap of a tree; nor that, as Ahmed explained, Socotra is home to nine species of the tree, all unique to the island. I caught the drop of sap on my finger and inhaled a sharp, sweet fragrance; then I put it to my tongue. The torture of the drive was forgotten, and for the briefest moment, under the hot Yemeni sun, I tasted Christmas.Situated 250 miles off the coast of Yemen, Socotra is the largest member of an archipelago of the same name, a four-island ellipsis that trails off the Horn of Africa into the Gulf of Aden. A mix of ancient granite massifs, limestone cliffs and red sandstone plateaus, the island brings to mind the tablelands of Arizona, if Arizona were no bigger than New York's Long Island and surrounded by a sparkling turquoise sea.Some 250 million years or more ago, when all the planet's major landmasses were joined and most major life-forms were just a gleam in some evolutionary eye, Socotra already stood as an island apart. Ever since, it has been gathering birds, seeds and insects off the winds and cultivating one of the world's most unusual collections of organisms. In addition to frankincense, Socotra is home to myrrh trees and several rare birds. Its marine life is a unique hybrid of species from the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago's flora and fauna. They counted nearly 700 endemic species, found nowhere else on earth; only Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands have more impressive numbers.Lately Socotra has begun to attract a new and entirely foreign species -- tourists. A modest airport went up in 1999. (Before then, the island could be reached only by cargo ship; from May to September, when monsoon winds whip up the sea, it could be cut off entirely.) That year, 140 travelers visited. The annual figure now exceeds 2,500: a paltry number compared with, say, the Galapagos, but on an island with only four hotels, two gas stations and a handful of flush toilets, it's a veritable flood.They -- I should say ''we'' -- constitute an experiment. Encouraged by a United Nations development plan, Socotra has opted to avoid mass tourism: no beachfront resorts; instead, small, locally owned hotels and beachfront campsites. The prize is that rarest of tourists, eco-tourists: those who know the little known and reach the hard to reach, who will come eager to see the Socotra warbler, the loggerhead turtle, the dragon's blood tree -- anything, please, but their own reflection.Riding with Ahmed, it was immediately evident that, though the island is small in size, it cannot possibly be seen without a hired driver and guide, for the simple reason that there are few proper roads, fewer road signs and no road maps.The first paved roads were built by the Yemeni government only two years ago: wide, open scabs on the landscape that stretch across the island yet see virtually no traffic. The new roads, it turned out, were a sore spot with Ahmed and the United Nations Socotra Archipelago Conservation and Development Programme. ''The experience is so different if you spend 45 minutes on a road versus three or four hours,'' Paul Scholte, the program's technical adviser in Sana, Yemen's capital, said to me. ''The whole perception of the island changes due to the road.'' Then there was the matter of placement. Only at the last minute did the S.C.D.P. manage to convince the government not to send the road through a stretch of coastline designated as a nature preserve. It's fair to say that Socotra's future may be read in the lines of its roads: how many, how wide, where they lead and who is encouraged to travel on them.Ahmed took me to the beach that would have been paved over: shimmering blue water, powdery white sand and not a soul in sight. A ghost crab, pure white, with just its pin-stalk eyes peeking above the water like twin periscopes, drifted by on a current in the shallows. I watched it watch me and then bury itself in the sandy floor.According to Scholte, roughly half of Socotra's tourists are Italians, who seem mainly interested in the beaches: ''Italians go because it's new, it's cheap, but not because it's special.'' The French and Germans, in contrast, go for special: they come to hike, visit the island's nature preserves, maybe rent camels and spend several days trekking as a group across the Haghier mountain range at the center of the island.As for Americans, well, there weren't many. I could understand: a conservative Arab country hardly seems like a good first choice for a vacation, much less the country where, in 2000, Al Qaeda forces bombed the U.S.S. Cole; where, in 2006, tribesmen kidnapped a group of French tourists; and where (according to my guidebook) a Kalashnikov can be had for only a little over $100. But whatever Yemen's troubles, Socotra is far removed from them. Everyone I met was garrulous and open, and seemed genuinely excited, at least for the moment, at the prospect of foreign visitors.In devising its eco-tourism plans, Socotra aims to follow in the footsteps of the Galapagos. Unlike the Galapagos, however, Socotra is significantly inhabited, and has been for some 2,000 years. More than 40,000 people now live there: many in Hadibu, the island's main town, the rest scattered in small stone villages, working as fishermen and semi-nomadic Bedouin herders. Nature and culture are longstanding neighbors.Late one afternoon Ahmed and I drove to a Bedouin village high on the plateau, where we would stay the night. Just before sundown, we arrived at a small cluster of low-ceilinged stone structures, home to an extended family and their herd of goats. After removing our shoes and entering, we were given the best pillows to recline on and served tea. Dinner followed: goat's-milk yogurt, drunk from a communal bowl; a thin, freshly baked flatbread; and a large plate of rice cooked in goat's milk, which we ate with the fingers of our right hands.Ahmed led the conversation, which involved goats and water projects. It proceeded not in Arabic but in Socotri, a language that is unique to the island and related to some of the oldest of the Near East. Socotri describes 24 months in its calendar, each roughly 13 days long, including the Month of the Cow's Breath, when heavy winds turn the sea to foam, and the Month of Crabs, when ghost crabs crowd the beaches by the thousands. By the light of a kerosene lamp I cajoled our host into teaching me several Socotri phrases. The most handy was the one for ''I'm full.'' No, thank you, no more goat's milk, goat's-milk yogurt or fricasseed goat, I'm full -- kheapaak!Blankets and mats were offered to sleep on. But mosquitoes, born from a nearby rainwater tank, had found me, so I stepped outside and set up my tent. The sky was thick with stars. Lying on the rocky ground, with the scent of frankincense fresh in memory, I felt as though I had stumbled into a chapter of the Old Testament. Well before dawn I woke to the sound of the family patriarch's voice warbling a long, mournful prayer. He finished after a few minutes, and the night closed over the sound. I listened awhile longer to the holy darkness, then fell again to sleep.The next morning we made for the forest of dragon's blood trees. The dragon's blood tree, Dracaena cinnabari, is Socotra's flagship species. With a vertical trunk and arching canopy, the tree resembles a parasol that's been blown inside out. When its trunk is cut, it oozes a red sap that gives rise to cinnabar, a resin with famous medicinal qualities. We had seen the trees scattered here and there on the plateau, but the highest concentration was in a nature reserve tucked high in the Haghier Mountains. We would drive to the base of the range and hike in.On the drive up, Ahmed stopped to chat with a Bedouin man herding cattle with his young son. Through the open window, he and Ahmed gently pressed their foreheads and noses together, the customary greeting among men on Socotra. For the equivalent of $10, the man agreed to be our foot guide. He hopped into the back seat and left his son, who looked no older than 7, to tend the cattle.The Haghiers are the original, uplifted core of the island, all worn and crumbling granite. Our path led upward invisibly from boulder to boulder, through low shrubs and aloes and amid the omnipresent droppings of goats and cattle. The United Nations conservation plan in 2000 divided Socotra into usage zones; more than 70 percent of the island is national park, off limits to development. Even here, though, livestock grazing is permitted, and well into the distance I could see stone walls marking tribal grazing ranges. I wondered aloud at what stage the conservation plan would begin to restrict the livestock.''We have to be careful with the local communities,'' Ahmed said. ''We can't just say, 'Stop, stop, stop.' They need to see a benefit first.'' Our $10 guide, I understood, was one step in the education process.After two hours we reached the peaks, a couple thousand feet up. I could see the coast below and the outline of Hadibu pressed against it. Ahmed handed me his binoculars and pointed a few yards away to a bird foraging on the ground: the Socotra bunting, with a rosy breast and black-and-white striped head. It is among the rarest of the island's endemic species and is threatened by predation from feral, non-native cats. Birders come from around the world to catch sight of it. And here, Ahmed said, I'd seen it with no effort at all! I pictured men and women traveling thousands of miles to tick names off a life list and suddenly wasn't sure whether it was absurd to keep such a list or shameful that I did not.The forest of dragon's blood trees, when we at last reached it, did not much resemble a forest, at least not the dense, dark sort associated with giant reptiles of myth. It was open and sparse, as though a light rain of broken umbrellas had fallen on the hillside. Recent years have seen a troubling decline in the tree's numbers. Although many older examples are present on the island (they can grow for 300 years or more), the younger generation is all but absent, with saplings found growing only on cliff sides and in the most inaccessible highlands. The entire species may well be headed for extinction.Scientists are unsure why. Grazing could be one cause; as development projects have brought a more steady supply of water to Bedouin villages, the herds of livestock have grown larger and more stable. A more important factor may be climate change: the island has seen a reduction in cloud and mist cover, which may affect the ability of dragon's blood seeds to germinate.After a lunch of wild oranges, we began the long hike out. I was tired and more than a little sun-dazed. My gaze slipped from the vista and became entranced by the rise and fall of the guide's feet in front of me; I marveled at the upright, unlabored grace with which he moved, and the fact that he was barefoot. My thoughts coalesced around the fuzzy notion that all the dramatic landscapes I'd ever seen -- Socotra, the Galapagos, Cape Breton, Yosemite Valley -- in fact were one and the same and all visible here before my eyes. Then I would focus again on the guide's bare feet and remember that I was not everywhere in the world but in fact somewhere like nowhere else. I invented a quiet little song:I'm in Yemen, I'm in Yemen,I see many men in Yemen.I drifted along to the rhythm of this internal chant and soon expanded it into an elaborate mantra involving anemones, anonymity, metonymy and my anomie. When Ahmed suddenly addressed me in English, I was taken by surprise.''Why do people want to travel to Socotra?''I was stumped. His question was pragmatic, I'm sure, but in my fugue state it sounded existential. Why do people travel? What are tourists, and what do they -- we -- hope to take home? Pleasure in seeing something new, of course, but also pride in being among the privileged few to see it, and the self-assurance (however delusional) that our presence has not yet altered the very thing we've come to experience. How long can that spell go unbroken? Already, Paul Scholte told me, Socotra's few tourists have one consistent complaint: they see too many tourists.Even more than the flora and fauna, it seemed to me, the most fragile aspect of Socotra is its way of life. Here are a people whose own idea of travel mostly entails the pursuit of goats -- a people, in effect, whose ancestors had ended their travels here centuries ago, then ventured no farther. The most endangered way of life nowadays is the one that goes, if not nowhere, then somewhere very slowly, and a traveler must go to the ends of the earth to see it.I was tempted to ask our guide, if he could travel, what in the world he would want to see. But I refrained; the question would have meant nothing to him. When at last we reached our truck, I offered him a piece of the snack bar I'd been saving to celebrate. He picked at it and waved his hand, the international sign for ''Thanks, but no thanks.'' Kheapaak.ESSENTIALS SOCOTRA, YEMENBEFORE YOU GO: The main Web site of the Socotra Archipelago Conservation and Development Programme (www.socotraisland.org) has good background information. Visas are required for American travelers; visit www.cdc.gov for information on recommended vaccinations and medications. Although the U.S. State Department currently maintains a travel warning for Yemen, most experts agree that travelers need not have safety concerns about Socotra. Organizing travel to Socotra is challenging, so a travel agent can be very helpful: try the excellent Poe Travel (800-727-1960; www.poetravel.com).WHEN TO GO: October through April is best -- especially March and April, when the sea is flat and ideal for snorkeling and diving. Avoid the windy monsoon season from May to September.GETTING THERE AND GETTING AROUND: There are only two flights a week to the island, operated by Yemen Airways (www.yemenia.com); seats sell out well in advance. On the island, you need to hire a four-wheel-drive vehicle, as well as an English-speaking driver and guide. Expect to pay $250 to $350 for four days; be sure to negotiate in advance. These arrangements, as well as hotel reservations, can be made through the Socotra Ecotourism Society (ecosocotra@socotraisland.org).HOTELS: The island's few hotels are basic. Some have rooms with private bathrooms and flush toilets; all are inexpensive (about $10 a night). The Taj Socotra (no relation to the India-based chain) in Hadibu is simple and clean and has a popular outdoor restaurant; there's also the newer Al Mohet and, outside of town near the airport, the Chalet Socotra. Camping is an ideal way to sleep, since the island's main ecological sites are one or more hours' drive away from Hadibu; you can arrange to rent gear on the island.</text></article><article id="1835310"><summary>Four Madrid art galleries noted; photos (S)</summary><text>Besides museums like the Reina Sof&#237;a (www.museoreina sofia.es) and the newly redone Prado (museoprado.mcu.es), the city has powerhouse galleries filled with their own art-world stars.ELVIRA GONZ&#193;LEZ: Juan Gris, G&#252;nter Haese and Elena del Rivero (above) are all shown here.

It was a Saturday morning, and I was curious. So after a breakfast of spelt flakes, soy milk and green tea, I went out shooting.I believe in sustainable agriculture. I support gay marriage. I think war is a failure of diplomacy, logic and leadership. I'm embarrassed by the fact that it's 2007 and my country is debating evolution. Pot should be legal. I dream of a world where punches are made of flowers.And, it turns out, I love guns.At the gun class, I learned gun safety, legal obligations, targeting and trigger pulling. And there were coffee and doughnuts, so you could pretend you were a maverick cop who didn't play by the rules and, damn it, Chief, unless you let me do this my way, we're never gonna catch this killer. Here, take my badge!While shooting, I loved how the guns were small but also really heavy. I'm small and heavy, too, but not solid like a gun. I'm more like a duffel bag full of ball bearings and mayonnaise.Here is how a gun works. You put these small metal cylinders full of explosives inside, and when the cylinders explode the gun doesn't. It's tight and strong and sends the cylinders flying out at whatever you're pointing at -- a paper target or, I hope, someday, zombies. While most things these days -- movies, government employees, fast-food sandwiches and me -- are slapped together with cardboard and frosting, a gun is a precision instrument.Because I know how ridiculous I look holding a gun, I did pretty well. If your focus isn't on being cool while you do something, you focus on results. I was free. I cut dead center (or close to it) on my silhouette target's 8-ring almost every time. I imagined huge chunks of stew getting blown out of the backs of my attackers.Later that day, I took a restorative yoga class. Shooting guns and taking yoga on the same day was the biggest ''You got chocolate in my peanut butter!'' moment I've had so far in my life. Guns and yoga are French fries dipped in a milkshake. Scotch and ginger ale. Elvis Costello's ''This Year's Model'' after a bad breakup. Reruns of ''Law and Order'' and having no life: they're good together.You shoot better when you realize that your soul is a leaf falling through time, and that work shouldn't equal struggle. And yoga never aligns you with the universe better than when your forearm is still tingling from the buck and recoil of a .357 bullpup.Someone needs to open a combination shooting range and yoga studio. I'm serious. Maybe I should do it. Hose off a few clips of Glaser safety slugs, then see how deep you can go into Warrior II. The murder rate would go down. No, wait -- it would stay the same, but people would realize it's all part of a bigger plan. Or, no, it would go up, because people would realize the transitory nature of existence, and that everything that has happened or is going to happen is always happening someplace forever, so why not put a slug in that dude's head who won't stop talking during ''300''?The people I took the introductory gun course with were an interesting bunch: two guys hoping to become armed security guards, an indie-music-store-looking black guy, a dad and his two teenage sons and a guy who claimed to be an actor researching a role. Did they know a neophyte yogi sat among them, counting his inhalations and trying to make his exhalations take twice as long?Meanwhile, I was the only guy in the yoga class. In fact, I was the only non-soccer mom in the yoga class. Did they know they had a rifle-eyed street panther in their midst?Probably not. In yoga, you're supposed to go at your own pace and focus on your breathing. So no one saw me flopping my doughnut belly and Internet butt around like a wino when I was trying to do Bridge Pose, or Happy Baby or Slightly Superior Suburbanite. Like the legless, armless silhouette I shot at earlier that day, I had holes of self-loathing blasted out of me. My Corpse Pose must've looked eerily authentic.All these thoughts whizzed through my head like tracer bullets as I lay there, in the evening gloom of the studio, with a dozen moms breathing mom-breaths around me. I floated out of my body. I hovered over Burbank. I was one with my target, and my target was bliss.Namaste. Lock and load.True-Life Tales Patton Oswalt is a writer and comedian.

My parents emigrated from Northern Ireland -- Mom from Belfast and Dad from a village in County Derry -- and for the first decade or so of my life, my parents still called Ireland home.But at a certain point that changed; they came to love California passionately. Maybe it was when they realized that they couldn't bear the damp cold anymore and that they loved short-sleeved Christmases. Maybe it was when they realized that they liked the sound of the coyotes howling in the desert at night. Or it might have been the sight of wild peacocks strutting among the roses. I know my father tended the 20,000 young orange trees in his care as if they were his children, rising in the middle of chilly December nights and putting out the smudge pots used to prevent frost.As they grew ever more rooted there, I found home in a suitcase. Despite my traditional good-daughters-should-live-next-door upbringing, I became a journalist and moved to Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution. Then I moved to Guatemala City and to the Cuchumatanes mountains to work for the United Nations. In Central America, home was what I did, not where I lived or what I owned. But after five years investigating massacres and sniffing around death squads, it was time to head back to the United States, and I moved to Montgomery, Ala., to work for an advocacy group.Montgomery was verdant green -- like Managua with infrastructure. There were huge muddy rivers and miles of pine trees and more species of bird than I could count. It seemed a gentle place; people said hello and waved to strangers -- and the morgue wasn't stuffed with mangled bodies every Monday morning. I bought a bright yellow kayak and was adopted by two abused Alabama dogs. Seven years passed, and the kudzu crept slowly up my ankles. I even fell in love with someone relatively sane for a change. Then, in the summer of 2005, despite the stability -- or perhaps because of it -- I accepted a teaching job in New Orleans.My fianc&#233; and I rented a brick bungalow in Lakeview, a neighborhood of magnolia trees near Lake Pontchartrain, where statues of blue virgins protected manicured lawns and alligators patrolled the canals. On Aug. 1, we unpacked three cars and a moving van loaded with two small boats, a 100-year-old family player piano, the libraries of two journalists and too much stuff from years of travel. Within 28 days, the paintings had been hung and we had served homemade crab cakes at our first and only dinner party. On the 29th day, the levee broke and the water rose slowly, one brick every 20 minutes, until 11.5 feet filled the house.We raced back to Montgomery and rented a fully furnished place -- forks and all. It was a caretaker's cottage on a crumbling Montgomery estate that had belonged to a widow, Miss Mabel, who had recently died. Her abandoned garden of persimmon and peach trees, honeysuckle vines and grape arbors, had been taken over by birds and squirrels. We hadn't been in Montgomery for five weeks when my mother called to report that my father had advanced gastric cancer.Last September, during a visit before he died, my father asked me to write down his last wishes. We sat at the window where he loved to watch the hummingbirds that came to his feeder and to the special flowers he had planted for them. I knew that many years ago my parents purchased expensive plots in an Orange County cemetery. As I tapped away on my laptop, he stunned me by saying that he had changed his mind: he wanted to be buried in his village back in Ireland.I'm getting ready to take his ashes there. And a few weeks after I return I'll be loading yet another truck and moving with my fianc&#233; to yet another new life in Madison, Wis. I've decided to get my Ph.D.Although I should be doing one of the five million tasks on my funeral-planning list or my moving list, all I want to do is sit in Miss Mabel's garden with the broken elves and crumbling angel statues, watching the cardinals that come to her feeders.Instead of applying for part-time jobs and securing a student loan, I watch the fat robins doing their hopping hunting dance as they graze from one leaf pile to another, in search of the next worm. Maybe some of these robins will leave the South as the weather gets warmer and head North with us. Right now, with my head in Ireland, my heart in the Deep South and my belongings headed to Wisconsin, I have no idea where home is.Lives Trish O'Kane is the author of a guide to Guatemala.

In one swell foop, it raises the question: What is the Language Mavenhood? And poses another question: What is pluralistic ignorance? (It poses and raises but does not beg any question. Never use that to mean ''plead for an answer''; the phrase, from petitio principi, means ''to assume what needs to be proved,'' and such circular reasoners offend every logician. Use ''begs the question'' only when you mean ''ducks the question.'')The above parenthetical diktat is brought to you courtesy of the Language Mavenhood, whose members know who they are. The term pluralistic ignorance, however, needs definition even to the Mavenhood. It means ''a situation in which a group does not realize how large it is -- not necessarily a majority, but larger than any other group making up a given population.'' Thus, amid the elitist Language Snobs and the anarchic Language Slobs, among mediacrities and hip-hopocratic jargonauts shooting the Utubes and pretending to be Serius, there stands the fastest-growing crowd of all: un-self-aware writers and speakers, lovers of the language fascinated by its roots and user-judges of its flowering.The reason for today's uncharacteristic cri de cerveau is the cache of e-mail that has come in from all over the world in response to a hook placed in this column two weeks ago fishing for the origin and meaning of the vogue expression go figure. A sample:From Linda Rosul of the U. of Illinois at Chicago: ''I'm writing from Peru, and would note that in Spanish we say 'As&#237; es,' which literally means 'there it is' and has much the same meaning as 'it figures' but perhaps lacks some of the puzzlement.''From Myles Potters, location unknown: ''I think go figure has less emphasis on figuring something out and is more of a revelation that something just is, peppered with a hint of disbelief that it can be so.''From Michael Aaron, Perigord, France: '' 'Who would have guessed?' or '' 'What are the chances?' might be sufficient, if longer, substitutes for go figure, which imparts a sense of befuddlement; thus it can be interpreted as a type of statement-question.''Ira Grushow, emeritus professor of English, Franklin and Marshall College: ''Growing up in the Bronx over half a century ago, I heard the phrase colloquially employed by my elders as a kind of rhetorical challenge not to the deductive but to the imaginative faculty to explain some complex or bizarre situations and behaviors. It relates less to our Leader's 'you do the math' than to the old-fashioned 'only fancy' that one encounters in the early translations of dialogue in Ibsen and Dostoyevsky.''I noted the early use in the 1950s in its longer form as ''go figure it out,'' but David Wolitzky, director of N.Y.U.'s Ph.D. program in clinical psychology, writes: ''The connotation is different. Go figure is used to express the feeling 'Isn't it amazing?' in relation to something ironic or unexpected. For example: 'Remember Max? He left his wife for a much older woman.' The response is 'go figure' to imply 'Who would have expected that?' ''Michael Farber of Manhattan offers a nice synonymy with two dialect words: ''Go figure is, in my argot, quite similar to 'who'd a thunk?' It expresses a fair amount of irony and incredulity, though it is often used facetiously, as in the ubiquitous 'duh.' '' (Pronounced with a single tone, duh -- which has not, to my knowledge, received the linguistic dissection it deserves -- means ''That's pretty stupid, I guess.'' Pronounced with a sinking, two-level tone, the intended imitation of stupidity of duh-uh is accentuated.)Nancy Laleau (what a lovely name; I can hear the strains of &#201;douard Lalo's ''Symphonie Espagnole'' in the background) writes: ''I began using go figure! at about the same time I learned f&#237;jese! (Spanish). My bilingual friends and I love f&#237;jese! because it doubly emphasizes our disbelief and usually disapproval. I also speak Haitian Creole. The following gesture comes pretty close: a gleeful slapping of one's hands back and forth with mounting excitement and a delightfully horrified facial expression.''The Yiddish Possibility''You've missed it entirely,'' writes Jeffrey Friedman. ''It is derived from the Yiddish expression gay vays, 'go know.' '' A dozen readers shot in that two-word message: go know. Joseph Lowin, Ph.D., columnist for Hadassah Magazine, recalls in a recent interview with Robert Pinsky, ''When I asked him why he thought he was chosen poet laureate, he answered, with an unmistakable Yiddish inflection, 'Go figure.' ''In his 1989 ''Joys of Yinglish,'' Leo Rosten wrote: ''In English, one says, 'Go and see [look, ask, tell]. . . . ' Using an imperative without any link to a conjunction is pure Yiddish, no doubt derived from the biblical phrase, translated literally, '. . . Go praise the Lord.' (In English, this becomes 'Come, let us praise the Lord.')''Rosten believed that the imperative go was followed in English by a word like and or to, as in ''Go and see'' or ''Go to hell,'' or with a comma substituting for the joining word, as in ''Go, see if she's the one.'' But his theory of the skipped and can be challenged; the expression ''Go soak your head'' has no Yiddish connotation, and the phrase spat out every two minutes on ''The Sopranos'' is purely impure English.My call: Go figure is a clip of standard English ''Go and figure it out for yourself,'' given a Yiddish overlay by go know and an expressive shrug and weary rolling of the eyes long identified with an ethnic group.That's one maven's opinion.

Along the way, he is the target of an assassination attempt, but it is deflected by Zelikman's crafty hat work.''War,'' said Joseph Hirkanos to the elephant. He spat on the grass and shook his head and pulled at the braided strands of his beard. The elephant snorted as if in agreement, with her usual air of stoic disdain, and went on ripping up sheaves of chess grass with her scarified trunk and stuffing them into her mouth. Her own warlike career long past, she was a great placid dam of at least 50 who had been captured by Normans decades ago in a raid on Muslim Sicily and fetched home to Francia to be neglected by a series of improvident barons until the day six months ago that she was absorbed, by way of payment, into the far-flung and arbitrary inventories of the Hirkanos clan. ''Bad for the Radanites.''''Not always,'' said his nephew, a would-be sharp operator who lacked for the satisfaction of his ambition only the quality of sharpness and who expended all of his energies, as far as Joseph could see, on preserving his opinions from contamination by experience. ''War creates opportunities too.''''In the short term,'' Joseph said, and spat again. ''Good in the short term is always bad in the long term.''They stood on a low rise to the west of Atil, above the final bend in the tortuous road that led from the sources of the Danube, across plain and mountain and swamp, by ship and wagon, to the mouth of the Volga, a journey that had required 18 months of hard travel. Joseph Hirkanos raised to his eyes one of those rare glasses of Persian manufacture that were a special line of his family's trade and scanned the horizon of his woes. A plume of dust half a mile tall moved against the southern sky, slow and menacing, a quill scribing oaths of rebellion along the shores of the Khazar Sea. The reports he had received, discounted by half for lies and bluster and by two-thirds for wishfulness, portrayed the rebels as a tough shank of perhaps 500 Arsiyah horsemen seething in a thin broth of Muhammadan irregulars and pimentoed with a fistful of Nestorians, pagans, worshipers of fire and Jews who wished for or foresaw the downfall of Buljan. All of them barbarians, in the view of Joseph Hirkanos, particularly the Khazar Jews. As with most of the Turkic hordes to come tumbling on horseback out of the eastern steppe, outward forms of worship were a matter of relative indifference to the Khazars, and Joseph had always suspected that their adoption of Judaism was not the result of divine calling so much as the mark of a politic reluctance to appear to side with either their country's Christian or its powerful Muslim neighbors.''Ten years since my last visit, and the moment I arrive a war breaks out,'' Joseph Hirkanos said bitterly. If the Khazars, that tolerant and pragmatic people, had fallen prey to doctrinal strife, what hope was there for the world? ''A religious war.''''That is the least of our concerns,'' said Menashe, his brother, appearing without a stir of air or a whisper in the grass. Like his brother and any successful Radanite Jew, he was addicted to the practice of stealth, silent and modest, fitted by training and nature to pass unremarked among the hostile and warring kingdoms except when the time came to buy or to sell, at which point, like some inverse hero in a legend, he would don his cloak of visibility and bestow the shining gift of trade on nations mired in the darkness of conquest and retaliation. ''The Venetian will be dead by sunset.''They had acquired the stock and services of an Italian merchant Jew in the Crimea, in the city of Cherson, where the father of Joseph's nephew, showing typically poor judgment, had succumbed to some kind of distemper. Now there would again be nine in their party, a situation intolerable to an observant Jew, particularly with evening coming on, though Joseph would hardly miss the Venetian's caviling or tendency to whistle tuneless tunes all day and night, even in his sleep.''That is lamentable,'' Joseph said, lowering the Persian glass and looking past his brother, like him hairless and fatless, with the hooded eyes and large ears of some prudent desert mammal, past his half-orphaned half-wit of a nephew, past the huddled mules and horses, past the circle of wagons with their covers of hide and shingled plank, filled with the fortune in furs, hides, lumber, iron and gemstones that he had amassed, bartered and shepherded under so much hardship all the way from Regensburg to this windswept hillock above the lightning fork of the delta, to Atil, a city whose rulers had always displayed a notable passion for the company of elephants. ''But more lamentable in the eyes of the Most Holy than the impiety of nine little Jews would be the sealing of yet another trade route from West to East because of squabbling among the faiths.''''One by one they are being lost,'' his brother agreed, his ancestral memory of the decline of the great age of trade fleets and caravans reaching back, like that of all Radanites, to the fall of Rome and the rise of those warring stepchildren of Judaism, the followers of Islam and Christianity, who in violation of God's desire and teaching and above all his good sense would rather kill than haggle.''That looks like a Frank,'' the nephew said, and though his eyes were too young to require the optical arts of Persia and he had been born and raised among Franks, the uncles were so accustomed to ignoring his unbroken string of idiocies that neither paid the slightest attention but continued to gaze down at the shining white city of the Khazars spreading on either side of the river. By the time they turned to acknowledge the straw-haired stranger, mounted on a shaggy horse with a big nose, he was nearly upon them. Joseph just had time to note the band of pallor on the Frank's brow implying the recent loss of a hat, and the giant needle in his sword belt, which perhaps betokened membership in a mendicant order of holy haberdashers or some other monastic absurdity.''You are Radanites,'' the lean-shanked stranger said in Frankish, and Joseph thought he detected a note of wonder in the stranger's voice, as if the man knew them not only by their braided beards and the style of their head wraps but had in fact met them before, in person, somewhere among all the roads and kingdoms. ''Out of what country?''''Francia,'' the nephew said, before either of his uncles could lay the silencing hand of a vague reply across his fat fool lips. ''Regensburg.''''Ah,'' the stranger said, and nothing more, as if the region and the name of the city meant nothing to him, so that Joseph's suspicions were aroused. The stranger swung down from his saddle and stretched his legs, making three slow circuits around the elephant, rubbing at his chin with a persuasive air of expertise, studying the channels and sierras of her hide with his fingertips, marking the graying stubble of her pate, the greater involution and deeper patina of her left tooth in comparison to the right, the skeptical cast of her eyes.''Cunegunde?'' he said finally.''She was known by that name at one time,'' Menashe said. ''A dozen years ago, when she was part of the menagerie of the Count Palatine of Worms.''For a moment the stranger abandoned all pretense of wariness and stood marveling at the beast as if, in that remote place between harsh mountains and a barbarian sea, he had come upon the great gray basilica of Worms itself. Something in the stranger's face, his way of scrutinizing the elephant as if seeing through its rough integument to its giant organs and the ducts and sluices that served them, stirred a recollection in Joseph Hirkanos, so that he seemed, for his own part, to recognize the stranger as by a family resemblance, by the anatomist's keenness of his regard.''Since you have risked a guess about Cunegunde, I will do the same with you,'' he said. ''Sir, you find yourself among Jews in a piteous estate. The hour of prayer is at hand and we are but 10 in number, one sick and dying from some impurity of the blood. And so I dare to inquire, in the hope that the question will not be taken amiss, if perhaps the gentleman might not count himself among the sons of Abraham and Isaac, and so make our 10th?''The stranger said nothing, gazing up at the pachyderm, who was long overdue for a wallow, her skin dusted with scurf and the residue of travel. He sighed, and the elephant sighed, too.''Take me to the poor bastard,'' the stranger said, ''and I will see what I can do.''They followed the nephew to the tent, striped and bulbous like a Radanite head wrap, in which the Italian lay silvered over with perspiration, eyes open and staring like a fish's. The stranger dropped his saddlebags and called for water to be heated. He knelt and removed his outer tunic and rolled the white sleeves of the inner one. He rubbed astringent oil into his hands and along his forearms to the elbow, to the amusement of the nephew, who drew a wrongheaded moral from the notion of a physician who medicated himself and not his patient. The stranger leaned in to sniff at the Italian's breath, pressed an ear against his chest and took the poor fellow's pulse. While he worked, he asked about the stages of the Italian's illness, and about the stations of the caravan's journey, and how things fared with the Jews of Regensburg, and the condition of the roads, and whether it was true that the kagan of the Khazars might by law be seen by no one but the bek, living in imperial isolation in a palace where he reigned at once absolute and powerless for a strict term until on an appointed day he was taken into a wood and strangled with a silk garrote. The Radanites replied that they had heard the same stories with regard to the kagan, but could add little more to them without falling into the sin of wicked speech.''I know that's the unbreakable creed of the Radanites,'' the stranger observed. ''And yet it's a strange paradox that if one lightens a Radanite's wagons while freighting a Radanite's purse, he often finds himself in receipt of the most arrant gossip imaginable.''Menashe Hirkanos invited the stranger to repeat his question at a later juncture, perhaps after having looked over some of their stock in gems or saddlery, and see if the reply he received then struck him as more informative.At last the stranger concluded his examination and begged them all to leave him with the patient so that he could enact, in his own dry phrase, horrible and malodorous procedures. When, an hour later, with night having fallen, the stranger joined them for the evening worship, the Hirkanoses, having compared notes in the interval, greeted him with renewed interest, which by their nature they did their best to conceal. After they remembered their dead they sat down by a good fire, and the Sorb slave piled their plates with grilled lamb and rice boiled with onion and fat and filled their cups with wine. The stranger attended to his food without apparent pleasure and sipped his wine. Then he took out a small length of clay pipe or hollowed bone, filled it with a dark paste and lit it with a straw.''Regensburg,'' he said. ''I spent time there, as a student of physic, many years ago. In the Jewish street.''''A golden lane of piety and learning,'' Joseph Hirkanos suggested, ''lighting the gloomy precincts of Christendom.''''There was a family with whom I lodged. The family of Meshulem ben Hayim, noted physicians all.''Joseph, Menashe, their Hirkanos cousins and the three other Radanites in the party, members of the Sacerdoti clan based in Ragusa, maintained the agreed-upon silence, watchful and measured. The nephew snorted and then endeavored to transform the snort into a not very credible simulation of choking on his wine.''A great family,'' Joseph Hirkanos said, in the same bland way. ''A credit to our brothers in the West. But not one with which we are personally acquainted, alas, having never fallen ill in that city.''''I imagine their numbers have dwindled since then,'' the stranger said. ''They were never numerous to begin with. A few old bachelors and widowers, buried in their books. Pitiably tending to the bodies of the very nobles and burghers who condone the massacre of Jews by ignorant mobs.''''I believe,'' Joseph Hirkanos said, ''that only one of that family remains.''''Only one.''''His name'' -- Joseph pretended to consult his brother with a look -- ''I believe it may be . . . ''''Solomon?'' the stranger said eagerly, and Joseph understood for the first time how young he was. But he said nothing, and the others shook their heads in solemn ignorance or amnesia.''You have a remarkable horse,'' the nephew said. ''It's a shame that your saddle and harness are of such poor quality and so hard used.''The Radanites turned to him and stared, none longer or with more astonishment than his uncle Joseph. The stranger's puzzlement vanished more quickly than that of the Radanites.''Indeed,'' he said. ''I owe him better. In the morning I would like to see the best of your stock.''''Your uncle is dead,'' Joseph Hirkanos said. ''Your father has abandoned all hope of your return.''Zelikman ben Solomon smiled.''He abandoned that years before I ever left Regensburg,'' he said. ''How is the old buzzard's health?''''Weak. Once we have concluded our business in Atil, we intend to return to Regensburg, taking the more direct route. With God's help you could see him again before it is too late.''''It was too late for him and me on the day that I was born,'' Zelikman said.''To forgive is a great blessing,'' Joseph said. ''But it is a greater one still to allow oneself to be forgiven.''''The Radanite stations are comfortable and well provisioned,'' Menashe said. ''The consideration you paid in return for passage with us would hardly reflect the luxury you could expect.''''The old boy doesn't have six months in him,'' the nephew said.Zelikman thought it over, slowly, seeming to visit in his pipe fancy the fog and clear sunshine, the deep fragrant forest, the cathedral bells.''I accept your kind invitation,'' Zelikman said. ''My services as a physician ought just to offset my fare.''The elephant gave a low moan, startling them, and a moment later they heard a faint trill, carried on the wind from off the river, and then another.''Trumpets,'' the nephew said.They walked to the edge of the upland and saw tiny fires starring the eastern dark. The Brotherhood of the Elephant had at last arrived at the walls of Atil. Zelikman watched the pinpoints flicker with an air of uneasiness as if they formed the points of a constellation by which he hoped to steer a doubtful course.''War,'' Joseph Hirkanos said. ''Bad for business.''''Not, alas, if you are a surgeon,'' Zelikman said.The next morning, the Italian sat up and asked for broth and soon afterward was heard to whistle the opening measures of his constant tuneless tune. But when they went to find Zelikman ben Solomon of Regensburg, to thank him for saving the life of their companion, of whom, despite his whistling, they were all rather fond, neither he nor his horse could be found. A subsequent inspection of the wagons revealed the absence of a good harness and an excellent Iberian saddle.Next week: Zelikman discovers Filaq's true identity, and Joseph Hirkanos recovers Zelikman.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.</text></article><article id="1835358"><summary>Dr Sander Koyfman comments on competing in annual International Air Games over Oludeniz, Turkey</summary><text>Sander Koyfman, 34, an addiction psychiatrist from Fort Lee, N.J.: ''The paraglider becomes an extension of yourself.

And before us lay a classic Alpine landscape: snow-blanketed gray crags dissolving into evergreen forests dotted with peak-roofed chalets; on the valley floor, a small river wended its way toward the Rhone. My wife, Jean, and I had no table, but the blue sky and warm sun made our snowy perch as comfortable as any picnic blanket in a summer field.I whipped out my brand-new Swiss Army knife and sliced into the sausage -- and my thumb. I yelped in pain, applied pressure, and drove my bleeding digit into the snow.No matter: the meal was still a triumph, because after four days of snowboarding in the Alps, we'd finally managed to bring the cost of lunch below 35 francs, or about $28 at 1.24 Swiss francs to the dollar, the exchange rate in late January, when we were there. The picnic ingredients, bought from La Chaumi&#232;re, a grocery with a staggering selection of cheeses, dried meats and local wines, amounted to just 26 francs.That figure may look ridiculously high to your average ski bum, for whom a bologna sandwich on the chairlift suffices. But this was Verbier, and we had higher expectations. About an hour southeast of Lausanne, Verbier is known for its tough terrain -- 2,200 skiable acres, much of it off-piste, steep and rocky -- and a cosmopolitan lifestyle that draws jet-setters who eschew the flash of St. Moritz but not its luxuries. In the bustling town, set on a 4,900-foot plateau, restaurants like the Michelin-starred Rosalp serve grilled langoustines and braised veal knuckles to the well-heeled, and frighteningly fancy boutiques like Fellay Sports sell fur ski jackets for well over 1,000 francs.At the same time, Verbier has a vibrant apr&#232;s-ski scene for the slightly younger (though no less wealthy) set, from clubby cocktail bars where a simple Kahl&#250;a-and-milk runs 14 francs, to British-style pubs and vast discos that pulse with dance music November through April. Add the remarkable scenery, and Verbier pretty much has it all -- and it's all expensive. Bologna is simply not in the picture.So to enjoy Verbier on the cheap, it turns out, means not staying there at all. Instead, we stayed in Le Ch&#226;ble.A half-mile below the town of Verbier, Le Ch&#226;ble was an old way station, a place you passed through on your way up to Verbier by car, bus or high-speed gondola. With only a handful of undistinguished hotels, this village of about 470 residents attracted few overnight guests.That changed in December 2005, when two hard-core Australian skiers opened Max and Millie's Bed and Breakfast in a former watchmaker's shop and house. Just a few minutes' walk from the train station and gondola, Max Finney and Millie Minett offer a chic alternative to Le Ch&#226;ble's other budget lodging, a hostel called Le Stop with dormitory beds for 29 francs a night.Max and Millie's five rooms were small but cozy, with Frette linens on super-plush beds and not a whiff of Alpine kitsch. When we needed more space, we walked one floor down to the lounge, which had wide sofas, Asian-inspired paintings and a large wooden dining table. It felt like the living room of a particularly sophisticated, well-traveled family. It certainly felt that way in the morning, when Millie served a delicious Australian-style breakfast of Greek frittatas, freshly baked muffins and ricotta pancakes.All this -- plus warm hospitality and expert ski advice -- came cheap. O.K., relatively cheap: the B &amp; B's rooms begin at 130 francs a night for two. But up the hill in Verbier, grim two-star hotels were starting at 220 francs, so while we weren't breaking any records for frugality, we had surely stumbled onto a great bargain.And as we learned wandering around Le Ch&#226;ble after checking in, we had also chosen a village largely untouched by the overdevelopment that afflicts ski resorts from Colorado to South Korea to, well, Verbier. Wooden buildings, many dating back 300 years, lined the twisty alleys, and the musty smell of horses and cows perfumed the crisp air. A mountain stream rushed through town and was channeled to cisterns that offered cold, pure drinking water.There were modern touches, too, like the Art Barn gallery, then showing works by Edouard Faro, who torches chunks of old wood, creating marvelous patterns and textures that give the natural world a technological sheen. And on the main road, there were a supermarket, a bakery, a bank and a post office.And then there was the gondola base, a gateway to a web of more than a hundred chairlifts, funiculars, T-bars and gondolas that crisscross the region. The area as a whole is known as the Quatre Vall&#233;es, and a variety of passes allow access to different subsections of the valleys. For our four days of skiing and snowboarding, we avoided the pricey, all-inclusive ''4 Vall&#233;es'' pass that cost 68 francs a day, and opted instead for the basic ''Verbier'' pass, 59 francs a day, getting one-day supplements for 13 francs if we wished to go farther afield.Our first day on the mountain started late, delayed by a big, leisurely breakfast of eggs wrapped in rashers of the porkiest bacon I'd ever tasted. It was nearing 10 o'clock when we boarded the gondola and began our speedy ascent, breezing through the midstation at Verbier proper. Besides being cheaper, staying at Le Ch&#226;ble means bypassing the long line at Verbier.As we reached the peak of Attelas (8,947 feet), we got our first glimpse of Verbier's famous terrain -- the couloirs and cliffs that are among the most challenging in the world, even when covered in fluffy powder. And yet, even with relatively bare snow cover this season, the telltale marks of skis and snowboards traced graceful cursive paths around the boulders and down the slopes.I was excited.Jean was nervous.We opted for gentler trails.''Gentler,'' like ''affordable,'' is a relative term in the Swiss Alps. Unlike in North American mountains, signs rarely direct skiers and snowboarders to pistes appropriate to their abilities. Rather, they point to the lifts you'll see along the way; finding the way down is your own responsibility. We mapped out a route from Attelas all the way down to the Verbier midstation, a long trail that offered a varied course of smooth pistes, ragged bumps and sharp curves.Better yet, the route took us past Au Mayen, a full-service restaurant with a deck looking out over the Val de Bagnes. We ordered a perfect bowl of vegetable soup and a cro&#251;te au fromage -- a thick slice of bread soaked in wine, topped with local cheese, a slice of ham and an egg, then broiled in a cast-iron pan until everything bubbled. With a glass of gamay, the meal for two came to 36 francs, which seemed reasonable at the time. But after a few days of lunching all over Verbier -- at cafeterias as well as restaurants -- it seemed impossible to spend any less. (Note to ketchup-loving Americans: Bring your own Heinz, or pay 1 franc for every tiny plastic packet.)Thank goodness we were staying in Le Ch&#226;ble, where restaurant meals cost considerably less than in Verbier. Main courses rarely topped 30 francs -- 10 to 20 francs below what we'd spotted on menus up above -- and were quite good. Caf&#233; Bar La Ruinette, on the ground floor of Max and Millie's, had surprisingly light cheese-and-mushroom fondue; Le Rosbif made great burgers and pizza for a raucous French-speaking clientele; and La Ts&#226;na offered local classics with a sophisticated touch, like goat-cheese fondue with edelweiss (alas, it was fully booked when we tried to go).Even when we splurged, we saved. Our big dinner was at Le Carrefour, in the nearby village of Bruson, and included foie gras, a mind-blowing entrec&#244;te with ''sauce val&#233;rie'' and grilled veal, which our enthusiastic waiter noted was from ''right here, in the village!'' The bill: 145 francs. In Verbier, we would have spent twice that.The only thing Le Ch&#226;ble lacked was an apr&#232;s-ski scene. Although the gondola stopped at 6:45 p.m., and the free bus service stopped at 7:50 p.m., we took our evening cocktails in Verbier, at places like Le Cosy Bar, aptly named if misspelled, and King's Bar, a basement lounge with bordello-red wallpaper and gorgeous chain-smoking Scandinavians. And we did it as affordably as possible, having picked up the essential ''Verbier Entertainment'' coupon booklet at T Bar, a cool place with a snowboarder vibe. The coupons got us a kir at Le Cosy, a glass of wine at King's and 10 percent off our bill at Le Rosbif. It was well worth the 35 francs.Perhaps that's why we missed the last free bus to Le Ch&#226;ble -- twice. Not a minor slip-up, considering that taxis charge 50 francs for the five-minute drive down the steep hairpin turns. So we resorted, at Millie's suggestion, to hitchhiking, which was surprisingly convenient (and, of course, free), thanks to the kindness of strangers (merci, Cl&#233;mence and Annie!) and the virtual lack of violent crime in Switzerland.Unfortunately, our luck ran out the last afternoon. For a change of scenery, we ventured out to Nendaz, two valleys and many, many miles away. It was 3:30 p.m. and to get back to Le Ch&#226;ble, we'd need to take a shuttle bus to another gondola, then zigzag our way back along a series of lifts and trails. There was, however, one glitch: the gondola was about to shut down. A taxi, meanwhile, would be 250 francs. After a slight panic, we wound up catching a (nonfree) bus to the town of Sion, then a train back to Le Ch&#226;ble -- setting us back 48 francs and 90 minutes.The waste of time and money stung. With better planning, we could have spent our final hour and a half cruising home through the snow and catching the sunset behind the peaks, instead of watching the mountain grow dark from inside a railroad car.At last, we walked into Max and Millie's, kicked off our boots and collapsed into the pillow-soft bed. We rested a few minutes, then plotted our evening: Could we do cocktails up in Verbier, plus some last-minute shopping (thanks to Switzerland's tax rebate for foreigners, gear is occasionally cheap), and still make it home for fondue at Caf&#233; Bar La Ruinette? We looked out the window: there --at the bottom of the valley, between the mountains, next to the river, in the last clear light of day -- the gondola was running.Five minutes later, we were on it.THE BOTTOM LINEHOW TO GET THERESwiss International Air Lines has the cheapest flights from Kennedy Airport to Geneva, starting in the mid $600 range. From Geneva airport, the railroad (www.sbb.ch) runs regularly to Le Ch&#226;ble, with a change of trains -- to the cute St. Bernard Express -- in Martigny. The trip takes less than two hours and costs around 94 Swiss francs, or about $76 at 1.24 francs to the dollar.WHERE TO STAYMax and Millie's Bed and Breakfast, 1934 Le Ch&#226;ble; (41-27) 776-4007; www.bedandbreakfastverbier.com.

Rather, the race takes place in the narrow, winding city streets of Monaco -- making it possible for viewers to watch every twist and turn from the relative quiet of various hotel balconies (right).The other favorite sport is watching the Aston Martins, Ferraris and Maseratis pull in with the rich and famous (last year Bono and Wyclef Jean performed at Monaco's Grand Prix Ball).But be warned: as with most global sporting events, tickets are not cheap, and hotel rooms in this legendary principality -- especially those with a view of the race --are expensive and coveted.At www.ontrackgrandprix.com, which has access to some of the most exclusive viewing locations and hotels, packages start at &#163;4,120 for two, or about $7,970 at $1.97 to the pound. It includes three nights at a hotel in Nice and access to a restaurant on the route. The V.I.P. package includes four nights in the four-star H&#244;tel de Paris Monte Carlo, airport transfers by limousine, race access at the two most prestigious viewing suites in town, where the pink Champagne may help ease the pain of paying &#163;10,970 a couple for the privilege.For a less costly weekend, www.formula1.com has a flight, hotel and car package to Monaco that can be customized all over the world. A three-night hotel and flight package from New York starts at $2,006.Or racing fanatics can simply hit the Indianapolis 500, also on May 27, where 33 cars race the oval at the Brickyard for roughly seven hours, and where the party is said to go all night. At www.sportstravel.com, three nights at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown plus paddock or C-stand tickets to the race and round-trip airport transfers start at $765 a person.IN TRANSIT</text></article><article id="1835366"><summary>Keith Bradsher travel article on cable car, tram and ferry crossings that offer beautiful views of Hong Kong; photo (M)</summary><text>WITH more tall buildings than New York City and more people per square mile than anywhere else on earth, Hong Kong -- a tightly packed city of 6.9 million people -- deserves its reputation as an Asian Manhattan.But travel just a few minutes from the crowded shorelines of Victoria Harbor and unexpected panoramas open up: mountains and harbors, waterfalls and meadows, tropical forests and lakes.To appreciate the city's skyline and its natural beauty at the same time, nothing beats the rides that engineers have devised to vault people up hillsides, across waterways and along ridgelines. And the next year or two may very well be the best time to take these rides.Soaring land prices are now creating intense pressure for property development. Among the changes are an eight-year redevelopment of Ocean Park, which began in November, and plans to turn the abandoned runway at the closed Kai Tak Airport into a cruise ship terminal, sports stadium, parks, shops, apartments and a hotel. Meanwhile, huge barges mounted with cranes are starting to fill in a large section of the heart of Victoria Harbor to make room for a highway and shopping malls, forcing the shift of the Star Ferry terminal.The view from some rides, like the recently shortened Star Ferry crossing of the harbor and the Ocean Park cable car, will be affected more than others by development. But all of them are spectacular, especially in the winter and early spring -- the best time of year to visit, when temperatures are in the 60s and 70s, and when typhoons are not a risk.NGONG PING 360The newest ride, a cable car called the Ngong Ping 360 (www.np360.com.hk), opened last fall and carries tourists, Buddhist monks and pilgrims on a soaring 3.5-mile route over sea and vertiginous slopes to a sprawling Buddhist monastery in the mountainous heart of Lantau Island.Leaping high over waterways and hills, the cable car has had more than its share of teething problems. It was supposed to start service in June, but mechanical difficulties and typhoon damage delayed the start of the 25-minute ride. With typhoon season past and the technical problems apparently resolved, the Ngong Ping system has drawn big crowds, particularly on Sundays.Planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport, built on a manmade island, seem to float past the cable cars. The crumbling houses of old fishing villages stand next to 40-story buildings as the cable car climbs over a hill and then high above a series of valleys with small streams, several lovely waterfalls and copses of trees.The destination, Po Lin Monastery on the 1,700-foot-high Ngong Ping plateau, features a 112-foot-high statue of a seated Buddha, made of bronze sheets over a steel frame. Admission to the 101-year-old monastery is free, but to climb up to the Buddha, visitors are encouraged to buy a coupon for a vegetarian meal in a nearby pavilion. At 60 Hong Kong dollars (or about $7.50 at the rate of 7.97 Hong Kong dollars to the United States dollar), the basic meal is grim, but the deluxe meal, at 100 dollars, is excellent. At the top of the cable car route is a ''Walking With Buddha'' exhibit about the life of Buddha. It consists of a walk through an artificial cave with sprays of mist and lots of fancy lights worthy of a Disney ride. Next to it is the Monkey's Tale Theater, which uses a cartoon to explain Buddhism.PEAK TRAMHong Kong's most popular tourist attraction is the pair of Peak Trams that rumble up and down the steep hillside from downtown to a gap in the hills from 7 a.m. until midnight. Starting at a terminal across Garden Road from the United States consulate, the trams (www.thepeak.com.hk/full/en/index.php) trundle between the aging apartment buildings of the Mid Levels neighborhood and then ascend a precipitous slope at angles of up to 28 degrees, emerging from among the skyscrapers and trees to lovely views of the harbor. At the top is the Peak Tower, an eight-story complex of stores and restaurants that has just been remodeled and has some of the best views in the city.The current, double-length maroon models with skylights dwarf the streetcar-sized green versions that made their way up and down the hill when I was a boy in Hong Kong in the early 1970s and lived right next to the tracks. But the trams, which run every 10 to 15 minutes, are not nearly big enough to accommodate soaring tourism from mainland China. The result has been long lines, particularly on weekends. The best time to go is before 9:30 a.m., with breakfast at the Pacific Coffee shop in the Peak Tower.AFLOAT ON VICTORIA HARBORThe Star Ferry (www.starferry.com.hk) has been a Hong Kong fixture for so long that many assumed it would remain an immutable feature of local life. They were wrong. Its famous downtown terminal was demolished last year, mainly to make way for a highway. The new terminal, across the street from Hong Kong's tallest building, Two International Financial Center, is at the tip of a landfill that sticks out like a long peninsula toward Kowloon, shortening the ferry's route.The trip across the harbor takes just five minutes now and is less entertaining. Much better are the round-the-harbor tours. The Star Ferry has outfitted one of its beautiful wood-decked vessels with armchairs instead of benches and added a small snack kiosk. The Shining Star sails once an hour around the harbor, stopping in Central and Wan Chai on the Hong Kong island side and in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side; there are also stops in Hung Hom, an unprepossessing area of Kowloon, during daylight sailings.More spectacular, but more expensive, is the Aqua Luna, a luxurious Chinese junk that also circles the harbor hourly. The junk has three traditional red sails, which make it popular with photographers, but is powered by an engine below decks. Travelers lounge on the top deck and receive a cocktail with the price of passage. It currently leaves Queens Pier in Central at 45 minutes past each hour through the afternoon and evening, but it will soon move to a pier just to the right of the new Star Ferry pier.OCEAN PARK CABLE CAREqually impressive is the cable car at Ocean Park (www.oceanpark.com.hk), a lavish amusement park and marine education center on the south side of Hong Kong island. The ride takes nearly eight minutes as it carries parkgoers a mile along a ridgeline overlooking a sea fringed with beaches and dotted with wooden fishing trawlers and gleaming yachts.When Hong Kong Disneyland opened in September 2005, many predicted it would cripple attendance at Ocean Park. But the number of visitors to Ocean Park has surged instead, nearly keeping pace with Disneyland despite lacking Disney's global brand. Panoramic views, terrific roller coasters and proximity to downtown Hong Kong, just a 10-minute taxi ride away, explain Ocean Park's success. By contrast, Disneyland takes three times as long to reach out on Lantau Island and emphasizes Disney-brand scenery over rides and blocks out views of Hong Kong so as to preserve an all-encompassing Disney feel.At Ocean Park, older children may love the Dragon roller coaster best, with its three loop-the-loops above a sea channel plied by massive container ships. Younger children may prefer the wide array of gentler rides. But for many adults, the best attraction may lie in the cable car that gently floats along the spine of the park's jutting peninsula.JOURNEYS | HONG KONG</text></article><article id="1835367"><summary>Richard Woodward reviews book Tales From the Torrid Zone: Travels in the Deep Tropics by Alexander Frater; photo (M)</summary><text>Tales From the Torrid Zone: Travels in the Deep Tropics  By Alexander Frater  Knopf, 382 pages, $25.95 hardcoverOne-third of the earth's population lives between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, in the so-called Torrid Zone. Most of Africa, South America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands swelter between these latitudes. More than one observer, including several in this book, have attributed the chronic underdevelopment found in these places to the diseases, earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis that flourish in the volatile climate.Chancy, devastating weather is the bad news about the tropics. The good news is that the travel writer Alexander Frater has again been navigating the region, as he did so memorably in ''Chasing the Monsoon.''As we learned before, he is a divided soul when it comes to the steam-baked life. He was born in Vanuatu, the grandson of Scottish Presbyterian missionaries. His father adored his job as an island doctor, while his mother built schools but suffered from a sort of perpetual nervous breakdown, terrified that some untreatable virus would carry her children away.As Mr. Frater skips lightly among dozens of countries and several centuries, his collage of windswept impressions can at times be hard to follow. Any memory that introduces an eccentric character or juicy factoid about a tropical illness suffices to lift us from London to Burma, China to Senegal. He is unfailingly jolly even when -- especially when -- faced with wretched food and sanitation on poorer islands.The book's broader design comes into view only after many such episodes. One theme is the legacy of colonialism, in particular the rivalry between the French and English around the globe. Meeting an attractive Frenchwoman revives childhood prejudices. ''We all knew that while both nations had been profitably exploiting the tropics for centuries, the British, at least, continued to spread enlightenment,'' he writes in mock support of his birthright.Another motif is the sound of bells. A chapter on his frantic efforts to install an English turret bell in his grandfather's church on Paama brings home to him the ancient hold of Christianity on his life and its resonance around the globe.Mr. Frater's tale is, at heart, one of exile from Eden. Although his father's enthusiasm for warm and wet places has seemed to direct the course of his life, it is his mother who warns him that he must leave paradise and go to Europe if he is to discover ambition.Name a writer who has succeeded by staying in the tropics, she asks him. As in Proust's epic, this is the story of how a child grew up to become the author of the savory book we are reading.RICHARD B. WOODWARDArmchair Traveler</text></article><article id="1835370"><summary>Gregory Dicum travel article on day-trip around Rio de Janeiro in search of city's coffee culture; photos (M)</summary><text>IN Rio de Janeiro, every street corner offers an opportunity for refreshment: juice bars, a&#231;a&#237; stands, open-air bars and of course botequins. These neighborhood institutions are part caf&#233;, part lunch counter and part bistro; the place for a quick salgadinho, one of the salty snacks like fried balls of salt cod, and a cafezinho, the little cup of coffee beloved by Brazilians.Bright with mirrors, cool tile and loud signs in red and yellow lettering, the botequins have a retro feel. Caf&#233; Ga&#250;cho, in downtown Rio, is a classic. It opens to a busy street corner, making the most of the city's joyful culture and tropical air. Commuters step off the sidewalk to the cashier, offering a few coins in exchange for a chit, which they then take to the coffee counter.At Caf&#233; Ga&#250;cho, the counter is a circular island where patrons stand, a typical arrangement that is said to have been invented here. A man in a crisp white shirt stands in the center, working a stainless steel contraption of pipes and tanks, one tank for coffee and one for milk, kept warm by a bath of hot water. Cups and saucers steep in the water too, and after he takes the chit, the operator opens a steel door and pulls out a set, placing it, wet, on the stone countertop. Then he fills a stainless steel pitcher with dark, steaming coffee from a tap at the base of the tank, and with a fluid motion, splashes it into the tiny cup.Coffee in Brazil has always been a world unto itself. For more than a century, Brazil has been by far the planet's largest coffee producer. And Brazilians themselves drink coffee enthusiastically: total consumption is second only to the United States. But quantity and quality are different things: nearly all the best coffee is exported.Like samba and the Portuguese language, coffee is easy to mangle, but that being said the Brazilian coffee culture still has a transcendent quality. Cafezinho is the very soul of the botequim, and the botequim is a direct link to the golden age of Rio. In his classic 1931 samba ''Conversa de Botequim,'' Noel Rosa, who spent much of his short, dissolute life hanging out at a botequim right around the corner from Caf&#233; Ga&#250;cho (there's a mural of him there now), describes the sociable scene with swinging wit.During a recent visit to Caf&#233; Ga&#250;cho, I chose to have my cafezinho black; other options include Carioca (''Rio-style'' with added water), media (with milk) and pintado (just a few drops of milk). Sugar goes without saying in Brazil. I leaned on the cool stone, listening to the clatter all around me, watching the whiteness of the sugar vanish into the black coffee. After a quick stir with the doll-sized spoon, I raised the cafezinho to my lips.It was terrible.EVEN if the beans at Caf&#233; Ga&#250;cho had been the best available, botequins often manhandle the brew, heating it for hours and driving off any flavor. Cariocas (people who live in Rio) told me over and over that to get a good cafezinho at a botequim, it is essential to get there first thing in the morning. Given Rio's unparalleled nightlife, that turned out to be impossible, even for coffee enthusiasts like my wife, Nina, and me, co-authors of a book about the addictive bean.But at its best, Brazilian coffee has a full, mellow flavor. Unlike the brightly acidic Central American and Colombian coffees that are popular at trendy cafes in North America, Brazilian ''naturals'' have a round taste that evokes a time when coffee was a simpler matter. Think vintage 1970s Chock Full o'Nuts. ''Brazilian Arabica naturals are good all-day coffees,'' said Manoel Corr&#234;a do Lago, a Rio coffee trader who works with huge international buyers.When coffee first came to Brazil in the 19th century, the steep hillsides all around Rio were planted with the dark bushes. They quickly depleted the soil, and the hot climate affected the taste (a ''Rio-y'' flavor is still considered a defect), so production moved to the highlands in the state of S&#227;o Paulo. Nonetheless, Rio became the cultural capital of Brazil, with a distinctly European sensibility: when the Portuguese royal family fled Napoleon by moving to Rio in 1808, the city became the only New World seat of a European monarchy.So it's no surprise the city also developed a sophisticated caf&#233; culture reminiscent of Paris or Vienna. Confeitaria Colombo, downtown, is the grandest example. The huge, elegant space opens up to a canopy of stained glass that washes filtered light onto huge mirrors. Their dark, carved frames are of the same ornate style as the opulent wood-and-glass cabinets towering above the counters. Marble tables and heavy cane-seated chairs are spaced generously around the tile floor, and orange-aproned waiters roam the noisy space carrying cakes and luxurious drinks on gleaming silver trays.We had sublimely fresh pineapple juice spiked with green flecks of mint, a garlicky empada (a pastry filled with minced hearts of palm and salt cod), a fudgy brownie and assertive espresso. Nina pronounced it ''quite good.''This was not our first espresso in Rio. Espresso from Illy and Lavazza has already replaced the cafezinhos long served to visitors at many of the city's shops, as well as at many caf&#233;s and restaurants. In November, Brazil's first Starbucks opened in S&#227;o Paulo. Though the beans in virtually all of these blends are Brazilian, they have been transformed into a globalized product.Cafezinhos are traditionally complimentary at the end of a meal. But espresso is never free. Mr. Corr&#234;a do Lago, whose gaze turns dreamy when he thinks of the perfect cafezinho -- ''I love them,'' he says -- is also an economist. Because it's not usually free, he says, espresso in Rio is more reliable. So far, there's no sign of a gourmet cafezinho.Rio's espresso scene is most developed in fashionable enclaves like Leblon and Ipanema, as well as more bohemian districts like Santa Teresa, a hilltop neighborhood of majestically shabby old houses, art galleries and restaurants served by a rickety yellow tram from downtown. There, we sat under leafy mango trees on the terrace at Largo das Letras, a small cafe in a big, old mansion that also houses a bookstore and a dance studio. Looking out over Rio's chaotic expanse, we enjoyed an ineptly but enthusiastically pulled Lavazza.Later, near the other end of the tram, in Rio's old center, we found one of the best shots of espresso in the city. ''Here you drink better quality than we send to Finland,'' said the owner, Oswaldo Aranha Netto, referring to one of the most demanding coffee markets in the world. Mr. Aranha, a lifelong coffee trader, opened Caf&#233; Rubro on the ground floor of a building occupied by some of the country's most venerable coffee traders (including Mr. Corr&#234;a do Lago's). Though the small, sparse espresso bar is hard to find, Mr. Aranha says a thousand people make their way there every day. As we spoke, we each polished off a large mug filled with rich black espresso made with beans from the Sur de Minas region, north of Rio.Fat tropical raindrops began to fall in the fading evening light outside, and Mr. Aranha, a true coffee lover deep in the caffeine thrall, leaned in close to us. ''Brazil is different from the rest of the world,'' he said, his English tinged with Brooklynese from his days living in one of the world's other great coffee ports. ''It's the only country that can produce anything you want.''CUP BY CUPCaf&#233; Ga&#250;cho, at Rua S&#227;o Jos&#233;, 86, in Rio's Centro (21-2533-9285), is a classic botequim. Get a cafezinho because you must (0.80 reais, or about 40 cents at 2.1 reais to the U.S. dollar), but be sure to sample the classic sandwiches like pernil (marinated roast pork) and rib roast (4.50 reais). Or for a lighter snack, get the classic combination of media (cafezinho with milk) with p&#227;o na chapa com manteiga (grilled buttered bread) for under 3 reais.Confeitaria Cav&#233;, at Rua 7 de Setembro, 137, Centro (21-2221-0533; www.confeitariacave.com.br), is the oldest in Rio. The interior is a little cramped, and the fluorescent lights dispatch any remaining charm, but the cakes are delicious. Try the signature ratinho, a playful mouse-shaped pastry flavored with marzipan, or the succulent, eggy rabanada.Also in Centro, at Rua Gon&#231;alves Dias, 32, Confeitaria Colombo (21-2232-2300; www.confeitariacolombo.com.br) has been on every visitor's itinerary since it was founded in 1894. In the magnificent space, it's not hard to discern the echoes of generations enchanted by this city.Armaz&#233;m do Caf&#233; is a local chain with eight locations in Rio. The original opened 10 years ago in Ipanema, at Rua Maria Quit&#233;ria, 77 loja G (21-2522-5039; www.armazemdocafe.com.br). Coffee blends reflect the range of beans available from different parts of Brazil, and the place is often hopping.Largo das Letras, in a big mansion at Rua Almirante Alexandrino, 501 (21-2221-8992; www.largodasletras.com.br), epitomizes Santa Teresa's theatrical decay. Flip through a small but well-chosen collection of books about Brazilian history, art and culture, and sigh before the vista of Rio spread out below.Some of the best espresso (2.20 reais) in Rio can be found at any of the three locations of Caf&#233; Rubro. As you sit in the small, gleaming shop at Rua da Quitanda, 191, Centro (21-2516-0610; www.rubrocafe.com.br), coffee blenders are hard at work a few floors above you, in rooms rich with the earthy smell of green coffee from all over Brazil.DAY OUT | RIO DE JANEIROCorrection:  April 1, 2007, Sunday  The Day Out column last Sunday about coffee bars in Rio de Janeiro misspelled an option for preparing coffee. Adding a few drops of milk is called pingado, not pintado. The article also misstated the name of a coffee-growing region in Brazil. It is Sul de Minas -- not Sur de Minas, the name in Spanish.</text></article><article id="1835371"><summary>Seth Kugel Weekend in New York column on great variety of cinema houses and film festivals; list; photo (M)</summary><text>HOW is this for a day at the movies? And not just any day -- today:12:30 a.m. Catch the late show of ''Factory Girl,'' the story of Edie Sedgwick (and Andy Warhol), at the Angelika Film Center.3 a.m. Sleep, but not in.11 a.m. It's time for ''Cobra Verde'' at the IFC Center.

In New York, it's Chaplin versus Nicholson. Or Iranian documentary versus Norwegian drama. Or 20-minute shorts versus seven-hour back breakers. Though it may at first sound silly to come to New York, then spend an entire day in a dark room, a look through the vast and eccentric landscape of New York City film listings might make that more tempting than you think.Art houses like the Angelika and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas will do, but even artsier houses make them seem almost quaintly mainstream. Things get a bit nuttier at places like Two Boots Pioneer Theater, which shows an utterly indefinable array of films. The theater's offerings this month ranged from ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' to ''Faces of Death IV'' to ''Air Guitar Nation.'' And every first Sunday of the month the theater welcomes ''First Sundays,'' a festival featuring short films and live comic commentary.Its East Village neighbor, Anthology Film Archives, has equally varied, and sometimes geographically relevant, fare. Today, for example, the theater is showing the 1956 film ''On the Bowery,'' practically begging you to take a pre- or post-film walk down the Bowery itself, one avenue west, to see how much things have changed.In other words, this is the kind of city where you can piece together your own ad-hoc film festival any weekend of the year.As if you needed to. Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said recently that there were more than 50 film festivals scheduled in the city this year.So hardly a weekend goes by that there isn't a festival in town. In the next few months, aside from the obvious Tribeca Film Festival, New York will be host to: The New Directors/New Films Festival at Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art, showing films from China to Norway to Argentina; an above-ground dose of the underground, with the New York Underground Film Festival; the New York African Film Festival; the 20th annual Columbia University Film Festival; the New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Film Festival; and the hip-hop-oriented H20 International Film Festival .Once those festivals are over, we will be approaching the outdoor film season. Though Manhattan residents like to head to the crowded HBO Bryant Park Summer Film Festival on Mondays, there are also ''Movies With a View'' at the Brooklyn Bridge Park, Rooftop Films (films shown on Brooklyn rooftops) and Friday night movies in Hudson River Park at Pier 46 in Greenwich Village.Of course, who can spend a whole weekend watching films? You should go to at least one museum (it's somewhere in city bylaws concerning tourists): in this case, the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens.It's much more than the displays that illuminate the difference between the key grip and the best boy (his assistant), though they have that too. There are awesome old television cameras, film ephemera like the actual head of Chewbacca from the ''Star Wars'' movies (how did the Smithsonian miss out on that?) and, best of all, activities that seem cool for the kids but are actually even cooler for the adults. Dub your voice over Dorothy's in ''The Wizard of Oz'' as she realizes she's not in Kansas anymore, or Eliza Doolittle's in ''My Fair Lady'' as she generalizes about Spanish meteorological phenomena -- then watch the scene.And if you can't stand going so long without seeing an actual movie, the museum understands: Choose between the 1940 serial ''Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe'' playing at the ultra-cheesified Tut's Fever Movie Palace, or some meatier independent or documentary fare.A DAY (OR MORE) AT THE MOVIESImaginAsian, 239 East 59th Street (Third Avenue), (212) 371-6682; www.theimaginasian.com/index2.php.Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street (Fifth Avenue and University Place), (212) 924-3363; www.cinemavillage.com.IFC Center, 323 Sixth Avenue (West Third Street), (212) 924-7771; www.ifccenter.com.Angelika Film Center, 18 West Houston Street (Mercer Street), (212) 995-2000; www.angelikafilmcenter.com/newyork.Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, 1886 Broadway (West 62nd Street), (212) 757-2280; lincolnplaza.moviefone.com/Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street (Avenue A), (212) 591-0434; www.twoboots.com/pioneer.Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue (East Second Street), (212) 505-5181; www.anthologyfilmarchives.org.Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway (West 95th Street), (212) 864-5400; www.symphonyspace.org.Museum of the Moving Image, 36-01 35th Avenue (36th Street), Astoria, (718) 784-0077; www.movingimage.us.New Directors/New Films (through April 1), www.filmlinc.com/ndnf.New York Underground Film Festival (March 28 to April 3), www.nyuff.com.New York African Film Festival (April 5 to April 12), www.africanfilmny.org.Tribeca Film Festival (April 25 to May 6), www.tribecafilmfestival.org.Columbia University Film Festival (April 30 to May 10), www.cufilmfest.com.WEEKEND IN NEW YORK -- AT THE MOVIES</text></article><article id="1835373"><summary>Mary Billard reviews Fontainebleau Suites condo hotel in Miami Beach; photo (M)</summary><text>THE BASICSThe Fontainebleau Hotel, opened in 1954, defined the heyday of swinging Miami Beach, version 1.0. Designed by Morris Lapidus for the eccentric owner, Ben Novak, the Fontainebleau at its height had Frank Sinatra playing the nightclub, Jerry Lewis filming ''The Bellboy'' and Auric Goldfinger cheating at cards (until foiled by James Bond). Long eclipsed by trendier progeny farther south on Collins Avenue, the original hotel with its famous curved facade is being renovated and restored and is scheduled to reopen in mid-2008. In the meantime, the 37-floor Fontainebleau Suites, a condo hotel, is open for business. A condo, but a very nice condo, with spacious rooms, most hotel services and amenities, plus an efficient staff.THE SCENENone. This is the anti-South Beach. Short on celebrities, hot bodies and buzz. Instead, people with a few extra pounds, as well as families. On the plus side, no pulsing bass from a sound system outside your window at night, a hazard at chic hotels with nighttime lounge areas by the pool.LOCATIONA 10-minute cab ride to Lincoln Road and the scene on Collins Avenue, which is either a pro or a con depending on personal taste. Taxis are readily available. It may also have the fastest valet parking ($23) in Miami Beach since the parking lot is in the bottom of the building, not down the street. The fact that it is slightly off the beaten path makes it a good bet for times -- like Art Basel -- when other hotels may be booked.ROOMSComfortable and a good size, ranging from 500 to 1,500 square feet, the suites are good for family vacations. The one- and two-bedroom versions have kitchens, Jacuzzi tubs and washer-dryer combos. Even the studios have kitchenettes with mini-refrigerators, cooktops and microwaves. Balconies, flat-screen TVs and marble bathrooms are standard issue. Be forewarned: a second condo tower is under construction nearby, with potential noise and blocking of some views. Request a room with an unobstructed ocean view or ask for the bay view of boats bobbing in the water on Indian Creek and the bright lights of South Beach. D&#233;cor is pleasant, generic rental-pool condo. Want more interesting architecture or room design? Head south about 20 blocks.DINING/ROOM SERVICEDining options are somewhat limited. A buffet breakfast is served in the lobby from 7:30 to 11:30 a.m. ($19.95), and an oceanfront and poolside grill is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Room service is from 6 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. and very prompt. A large, well-stocked Walgreens with some groceries is three blocks away on Arthur Godfrey Boulevard. (Walking distance for a New Yorker.) A Publix Super Market is about a 10-minute car ride away. No minibars in the rooms. There is Fiji water, its $6 price clearly markedAMENITIESThe tower itself has a heated pool on the seventh floor, but the other pool offers an over-the-top fantasy design with boulders, waterfalls and a hot tub (and it's where Tony Montana sat poolside in the movie ''Scarface''). In a few months it will be closed for renovation. The hotel does not have a private beach area; lounge chairs, umbrellas and water sports are available for rental. The gym is fully equipped.BOTTOM LINELong on substance, short on style, the Fontainebleau in its current incarnation runs counter to Miami Beach values.

Gray facades, graffiti, even an outpost of the sex-shop chain Beate Uhse, made it seem immune to gentrification.But as once-pioneering drags like Auguststrasse become oversaturated, expensive and even mainstream, Brunnenstrasse is emerging as the new gallery district for a younger, more avant-garde art set.Among the first were Jan Winkelmann, who opened his gallery -- a sleek box for offbeat conceptual art -- in 2004 (No. 185; 49-30-2809-3899; www.janwinkelmann.com). ''I was just looking for a decent, reasonable space,'' Mr. Winkelmann said. ''I had no idea it would explode like this.''By ''this'' he means the dozen or so galleries, high-end boutiques and designer bars that have sprouted in recent months in the district, which is in the former East Berlin. Talk of new leases fills the air. And with a lot of rear courtyards that are just starting to be renovated, Brunnenstrasse still feels like a bohemian frontier.Setting the incongruous tone are places like Amerika (No. 7; 49-30-4050-4953; www.amerika-berlin.de) and Diskus (No. 196; 49-30-2757-2140, www.diskus-berlin.com), artist-run galleries that rocked the Berlin art scene by showcasing up-and-coming artists from Leipzig and Dresden. Near the tram tracks and behind a graffiti-covered entrance, is Nice &amp; Fit (No. 13; 49-30-4404-5976; www.niceandfitgallery.com), a slim gallery that exhibits a whimsical mix of New York and European art. Brunnenstrasse ''has a raw charm, it's sexy,'' said Sebastian Klemm, 30, director of Amerika.The latest wave comes from abroad, as art dealers from New York and elsewhere discover the street's low rents and artsy vibe. Four of them opened the same night last September, considerably raising the street's international cachet.Gallery owners from Zurich and D&#252;sseldorf started Filiale (No. 188-190; 49-30-2758-2460; www.filiale-berlin.de). The nonprofit online magazine Artnews.info opened Artnews Projects (No. 190; 49-30-2790-7810; www.artnews.info/projects), a no-frills experimental space for young contemporary artists. The former Manhattanite Sarah Belden began Curators Without Borders at Brunnenstrasse 5 (49-30-4050-05-48; www.curatorswithoutborders.com). And two doors down is Goff + Rosenthal (No. 3; 49-30-4373-5083; www.goffandrosenthal.com), the Berlin branch of a gallery based in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.Fancy boutiques and restaurants have also arrived. The Lil Shop (formerly the fourth incarnation of the Comme des Gar&#231;ons Guerrilla Store) opened last January (No. 184; 49-30-2804-5338; www.lil-shop.com). And Zagreus Projekt (No. 9a; 49-30-2809-5640; www.zagreus.net) is a gallery that also serves food, with a different menu for every new exhibition. Dinner, currently a multicourse Cajun affair, is 25 euros to 30 euros, about $34 to $40.50 at $1.35 to the euro.New polish notwithstanding, Brunnenstrasse's decrepit buildings, fast-food kiosks and empty storefronts hang on, like a crooked smile with missing teeth. But the transformation is hard to miss.Several months ago, art dealers got together and published a slick map for visitors. It's already dated. New galleries and clubs are moving north, Weimar-era buildings are being carved into lofts, and the sex-shop disappeared last month.''It's a bit like the old '90s Berlin scene,'' said Oliver Miller, an American who just opened Kim, a bar at Brunnenstrasse 10. ''There's a certain brutality to the street, but it's the coolest part of Mitte.''SURFACING | BRUNNENSTRASSE, BERLIN</text></article><article id="1835375"><summary>Evan Rail travel article on 36-hour visit to Prague, Czech Republic; photos; map (M)</summary><text>FORGET all thoughts of Kafka, post-communist grit and writers trying to craft the Great American Novel, as most of the old ideas about Prague are now very far off the mark. Instead, expect a modern, extremely liveable city that is among the most Western (both literally and figuratively) of all the former Communist-bloc capitals, where long-held myths about Eastern Europe are exploded on a daily basis. The cosmopolitan Czech capital is home to better restaurants than you might find in many American cities, and a new generation of designers and style-conscious shoppers are helping shake off the drabness -- and the misconceptions -- of the past. Fortunately, the Gothic spires, cobblestone lanes, bridges and the supermodel-prone locals are all still gorgeous.Friday5 p.m.  1. Hide Away  Sometimes Prague seems like nothing more than a collection of overlooked details, like the lone Green Man lurking in the plasterwork of Tyn Church (inside the portico facing Old Town Square, at the top of the second arch from the left). If you walk along the building's north side, you'll soon face a small square with a narrow passageway at eleven o'clock. Pass through it and you'll enter tiny Tynska street, where the entrance to one of Old Town's best hideaways resembles a locked barn door. Tynska literarni kavarna (Tynska 6, 420-224-827-807; www.tynska.cz) is a ''literary cafe'' and bookstore where local writers and students meet in a series of arched rooms and on a quiet patio. Though it's right in the heart of Old Town, it feels miles away from the throngs.8 p.m.  2. Italians in Bohemia  You may not expect a Slavic capital to be a font of Italian culture, but Prague has been the home to notable Italians ever since the 16th-century court of Rudolph II employed the painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo, the gem-cutter Ottavio Miseroni and the sculptor Alessandro Abondio. Today the art is culinary. Check out Vino di Vino (Vezenska 3, 420-222-312-999; www.vinodivino.cz), a wine bar in Old Town that recently added a small selection of recipes from the Piedmont region. Entrees cost 360 to 580 koruny, or about $16.50 to $27 at 21.8 koruny to the dollar. For truly outstanding Italian cooking in Prague -- and many would say anywhere this side of the Alps -- head to Allegro inside the Four Seasons Hotel (Veleslavinova 2a, 420-221-427-000, www.fourseasons.com/prague). The chef Vito Mollica serves seasonal dishes like slow-roasted veal with Alba truffles and aged Modena balsamic vinegar, with entrees costing 640 to 1,700 koruny. You can see why some Italians think twice before leaving Prague for home.Saturday10 a.m.  3. Coffee, Cubed  Prague is filled with cafes, but none is quite like the Grand Caf&#233; Orient (Ovocny trh 19, 420-224-224-240; www.grandcafeorient.cz), a recently restored coffeehouse located inside the multi-level Museum of Czech Cubism. After your visit, check out the displays of Cubist paintings, furniture and architecture. Though the Gothic is far more obvious, Cubism remains one of the city's fundamental styles. Sometimes the two collide spectacularly, as in the Jungmannovo namesti, a square in New Town where the 1912 Cubist streetlamp by Emil Kralicek and Matej Blecha stands next to the Church of Our Lady of the Snows from 1347. In fact, some of the city's most important buildings have a Cubist touch: a later variant, Rondo-Cubism, was adopted as the so-called ''National Style'' in Prague's interbellum golden age between 1918 and 1938, during the still-revered First Republic of Czechoslovakia.Noon  4. Weird Beers  Noon might seem a little early, but Czech men often have several beers by breakfast. Reward yourself for your patience with a beery lunch. Guidebooks have rightly hailed Pivovarsky dum, a microbrewery with a beautifully hoppy Pilsner. Unfortunately, all that praise means it's often impossible to get a table. What your guidebook doesn't know about is the sister Pivovarsky klub (Krizikova 17, 420-222-315-777; www.gastroinfo.cz/pivoklub), a beer boutique and pub that opened in late 2005. Some of the hearty meat dishes are sold by weight: a large portion of roast pork runs about 200 koruny. Six regional microbrews are available on draft, as well as around 200 kinds of bottled beers, most of which you'll not see anywhere else.4 p.m.  5. Design Ghetto  Eastern Europe may not be known for its sense of style, but a small group of Czech designers are working to change that. Head to the old Jewish ghetto, where the three to four blocks around the Spanish Synagogue are home to a half-dozen cutting-edge boutiques. Start at Navarila (Elisky Krasnohorske 4/11, 420-271-742-091; www.navarila.cz), which sells vibrant, coarse-knit skirts and cropped sweaters, and pick up the free Czech Fashion Center map (www.czechfashion.cz) for other designers in the area.7:30 p.m.  6. Everything's Ducky  Eastern European wine used to be a joke, but the heartiest laughs are now coming from the French and Spanish wine companies making major investments in the region. Similarly, Eastern European cuisine has gotten a big boost from the West, with traditional Czech fare reaching a French-inflected high at Perpetuum (Na hutich 9, 420-233-323-429; www.cervenatabulka.cz), a modest, neighborhood restaurant that specializes in duck and goose. The juicy duck fricass&#233; and rich goose leg confit are both excellent. Entrees costs 130 to 310 koruny and a selection of Czech wines is available.10 p.m.  7. Romping in Zizkov  When tourists glut the center, Praguers head east. To get a glimpse of how locals party, take a 20-koruny metro ride to Jiriho z Podebrad, a square that splits two neighborhoods, Vinohrady and Zizkov. With its linden trees and fin-de-si&#232;cle architecture, Vinohrady makes a great place to live. But for a great night out, nothing beats the dives of Zizkov. Start at the area's chief romper room, Hapu (Orlicka 8, 420-222-720-158), for fresh-fruit cocktails like the Accident (strawberries, banana and vodka, 120 koruny). Then walk past the soaring television tower to the multi-level Palac Akropolis (Kubelikova 27, 420-296-330-911; www.palacakropolis.cz), an ever-popular club where everyone from the Pixies to Algerian funk bands have played, and also a spot for serious beer consumption.Midnight  8. Nightcap  Finish off the night at the grungy Blind Eye (Vlkova 26), a former speakeasy that finally went legit in September, though customers still have to ring a buzzer to get in. The name of its best drink is unprintable but fitting, containing 20 ounces of vodka, gin, tequila and white rum (195 koruny). If you're still restless when the bar closes at 5 a.m., go to Charles Bridge and watch the sunrise. It's probably the only time you'll ever see the statues without the crowds.Sunday10 a.m.  9. Combat Rock  Burn off last night's excess with a hike up Petrin Hill, which overlooks the tile rooftops of Old Town and has been a romantic spot since before Casanova was cruising there. If you're feeling more adventurous, climb to the top of the hill, go through the Hunger Wall at the south end and continue upward to the massive sandstone boulder that has enough overhangs, handholds, cracks and footholds to give even seasoned climbers a workout. Don't worry if you forgot your climbing shoes. Prague climbers have been spotted on this rock wearing everything from combat boots to dress oxfords.Noon  10. An Earlier Era  Old-timers threw a fit when their beloved Caf&#233; Savoy (Vitezna 5, 420-257-311-562; www.ambi.cz) was cleaned up in 2001, wiping away the tobacco stains, spilled beer and dusty Stalinist d&#233;cor of the earlier incarnation. Imagine their reaction when this faded Art Nouveau cafe was renovated again in 2005, emerging even brighter, with a restored plasterwork ceiling, sparkling crystal chandeliers and even (gasp!) a nonsmoking section. Is this the new Prague or the old one? With hearty, meal-size soups for 81 to 114 koruny, the prices almost recall the dirty post-commie era. But the efficient, waistcoated staff brings to mind an entirely different time: the glorious First Republic, when Prague boasted one of the highest standards of living on the Continent. Perhaps some things never change.THE BASICSCzech Airlines (www.czechairlines.com) currently offers nonstop flights between the United States and Prague, flying from both Newark and Kennedy airports. Round-trip tickets start around $650.The 40-minute taxi ride from Ruzyne airport to the city center costs about 700 koruny, or about $32 at 21.8 koruny to the dollar. Alternately, you can take bus 119 from outside the arrivals lounge all the way to Dejvicka, the end station, and transfer to the metro or a tram from there, all for a single 20-koruny ticket. Or buy a three-day combined metro, bus and tram pass for 220 koruny from the airport's Travel Information Centre.The city's splashiest new hotel is the Mandarin Oriental (Nebovidska 1, 420-233-088-888, www.mandarinoriental.com), which opened last September. Partially housed in a restored Renaissance-era convent in the Mala Strana district, it features one of the city's best day spas. Doubles in April start at 269 euros, or about $363 at the rate of $1.35 to the euro. For Old Prague atmosphere with literary and cinematic appeal, check into the Hotel Pariz (U Obecniho domu 1, 420-222-195-195; www.hotel-pariz.cz). Built in 1904, this Art Nouveau wedding cake played a key role in Bohumil Hrabal's novel, ''I Served the King of England,'' which was recently adapted as a movie. Doubles start at 150 euros in low season. Less expensive, though also literary, is the House at the Big Boot (Vlasska 30, 420-257- 532-088, www.volweb.cz/rippl), a family-owned hotel in Mala Strana where the poet James Merrill once stayed. The hotel's owner even figured in one of his poems. Doubles start at 3,000 koruny.  36 HOURSCorrection:  April 1, 2007, Sunday  The 36 Hours column last Sunday about Prague referred incorrectly to service on Czech Airlines from New York airports to Prague. The airline flies nonstop from Kennedy Airport only. It does not fly from Newark.</text></article><article id="1835376"><summary>Epilogue to Seth's comic strip George Sprott (1894-1975)</summary><text>EpilogueTHE FUNNY PAGES: I: THE STRIP</text></article><article id="1835385"><summary>Ben Ratliff reviews five new CDs; photos (M)</summary><text>Group DouehIf you've fallen under the spell of Ali Farka Tour&#233;, who died last year, you know about the scratchy, palpitating sound of Saharan guitar music. But you may not know the spectrum of smooth and rough within it. On the rougher edge is ''Group Doueh: Guitar Music From the Western Sahara'' (Sublime Frequencies), a vinyl-only compilation of music by the guitarist Doueh (pronounced Doo-WAY), from Dakhla in Western Sahara, on the western edge of the desert and the continent. An electric guitarist who uses Western tonality as well as more traditional modes, he creates a sound that cuts through the mass of voices and drums around him. Some of the tracks come from Doueh's old cassette archive, dating to the mid-'80s, and the record begins with the most rhythmically stomping and aurally distressed of them. (There are children's toothbrushes that play hit songs for the recommended length of a proper brushing, and they have better audio quality.) Between this and the liner notes' claims of ''searing, brash electric guitar,'' the question arises whether some Western assumptions about rustic authenticity are being served. But flip the record over, and the music becomes both sonically clearer and musically more complex: ''Dun Dan,'' with Doueh singing to his own guitar accompaniment, and ''Wazan Samat,'' with the vocals of Doueh's wife, Halima, are casual but brilliantly complicated performances.Francisco AncarolaThe Chilean folk singer-songwriter Victor Jara was murdered in 1973 by the newly empowered forces of the military dictator Augusto Pinochet. Since the end of that dictatorship, in 1990, there has been no shortage of cover versions of Jara songs. It's become almost a ritual for a certain kind of Chilean musician, especially since Mr. Jara's recordings were very nearly expunged from memory, the master tapes destroyed by the government. The latest is ''Lonqu&#233;n: Tribute to Victor Jara'' (Petroglyph), by Francesca Ancarola, a world-class pop-jazz singer who gives herself full license to build on Mr. Jara's songs. She multitracks her voice, building large choral swarms, and the band expands lavishly on the rhythm and harmonies of the original songs, which in some cases were stirring but fairly simple.Jorge MautnerA songwriter and novelist operating on the outskirts of Brazilian vanguard pop culture since the 1960s, Mr. Mautner has written songs for Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and others. He met Mr. Veloso and Mr. Gil in the early 1970s, when they were all political exiles in London, escapees from Brazil's military government. He's kept a certain kind of sage-outsider status ever since. Sixty-six now, but with the squirrelly energy of a much younger man, he has a new album, ''Revir&#227;o'' (Universal Brasil), shaped by Berna Ceppas and Kassin, two of the sharpest and most curious young producers in Brazil. Mr. Veloso and Mr. Gil's daughter Preta both sing on the record, and the music flows through country, disco, bolero, samba and African highlife. Mr. Mautner's lyrics, in Portuguese, take one fresh, politicized, cockeyed analytical position after another -- about hypocritical parents, relationships where one gives all and receives nothing, his country's excessive cultural myths. Someone should release it here, with translations; he's too good to be local.''Blue'' Gene TyrannyThe pianist and composer Robert Sheff, a k a ''Blue'' Gene Tyranny, made his first record, ''Out of the Blue,'' in 1976. He had drifted through the rock scene in Ann Arbor, Mich. (including a stint with the mid-'70s version of Iggy and the Stooges), but drew closer to the orbit of another Ann Arbor fixture, the conceptual new-music composer Robert Ashley. ''Out of the Blue'' has just been rereleased by Unseen Worlds, and some of it sounds awkward because of dated electronic sounds and a low-budget, academic approach to pop. But it also contains an ambitious and moving masterpiece that takes up half the record. It is ''Letter From Home,'' an epistolary song in the tradition of Harry Partch's ''Letter'' (and Eminem's ''Stan''). As the song fades between interrelated musical and vocal figures, its anchor is a long and touching letter, written by Mr. Sheff and read by Kathy Morton Austin, that wends from small thoughts to universal ones, most of them dealing with the implications of time. So it begins with lines like ''I really wrote to tell you the bar we used to play at has changed hands again,'' and ends with cosmic observations on a train's headlight. ''That light defines the area all around the train just as your love defines the way you see the life closest to you,'' Ms. Austin reads. ''Is that too corny, Blue? Well, you know that's how we are here. Write soon.''TrombonillaA trombonist who has played in jazz and Latin groups, Luis Bonilla is interested in exploding the usual structures of both kinds of music. So ''Terminal Clarity'' (Now Jazz Consortium), a live CD by his sextet Trombonilla, opens up each piece for fresh, exploratory improvising by the musicians, including Mr. Bonilla and the saxophonists Donny McCaslin and Peter Brainin. Sometimes the songs become raw and skeletal; sometimes they accumulate a thick pile of melodic lines, while the rhythm section keeps each piece steady.  MUSIC: PLAYLIST</text></article><article id="1835388"><summary>Gia Kourlas article describes new found importance of women dancers in Paul Taylor Dance Company; photos (M)</summary><text>THE allure of the Paul Taylor Dance Company, especially in recent years, has leaned in the direction of its men, in all their brawny, bare-chested glory. But the dynamic has shifted, as the company's excellent City Center season this month proved. While the men will never fade into the background -- Michael Trusnovec presides over the repertory like a Greek god reborn for the 21st century -- it is now the women, led by the company's senior member, Lisa Viola, who with their feminine mystique and splendor fortify the dances.Over the years there has been no shortage of standout women in the Taylor company: Bettie de Jong, Carolyn Adams, Ruth Andrien, Cathy McCann, Kate Johnson, Karla Wolfangle, Francie Huber and, obviously, many more than can be highlighted in a sensible manner. But the current group is special. While each dancer exudes a unique aura, they are all modern women and, most important, unafraid to show it.The company, which comprises eight men and eight women, has hardly abandoned its intrinsic team sensibility. The trust and spirit, which Mr. Taylor has described as ''what the audience sees besides the steps,'' is sparklingly intact. But the change occurred, beginning, for me at least, when Annmaria Mazzini joined the company in 1999. She has energized the entire group, men included.Mr. Taylor has said it takes at least two years for a new company member really to feel and look at home in his work. That was before he hired Laura Halzack, the most junior member of his company. (In the page of photographs in the group's program, hers is stuck on the bottom right, dead last.) She joined in the summer of 2006, and while it's impossible to know if she does actually feel at home, she certainly looks the part.There is something ''Roman Holiday'' about Ms. Halzack, whose freshness comes in the form of regal playfulness. Her red lips, which favor the serene hint of a smile rather than an animated grin, match her dancing impeccably: she is a lyrical creature whose gentle phrasing laps like water. She was particularly affecting in ''Roses,'' finely matched with James Samson, one of the company's most promising men. Together they epitomized graceful purity, moving as one with velvety softness.In Mr. Taylor's ''Airs'' she performed the difficult adagio solo, demonstrating her fluid ability to dance with ease and lightness without sacrificing the necessary weight. Ms. Halzack maintains the same softness and control, whether balanced on one leg or skimming the surface of the stage in swift, skaterly runs. Her one discernible flaw is her hyperextended arms, but while occasionally distracting, they also lend her elegance a youthful, gangly charm.It was a shame that Michelle Fleet, who joined the company in 2002, suffered an ankle injury before the City Center season began. Though she did perform in several dances, notably ''Polaris,'' in which her natural, bold technique provided a frame for her shooting leaps and sweeping turns, Ms. Fleet was replaced in several of Mr. Taylor's more difficult roles. She performed what she could, and admirably so, but in the end -- and this is meant only as a compliment -- it wasn't enough.Julie Tice, a petite blonde who joined the company in 2000, can tend toward proper, contained performances. She's bright and perky, but at times she seems too mannered and predictable for her own good. She shows more depth in darker roles, as she did this season in ''Banquet of Vultures,'' even though, or perhaps because, they seem the antithesis of her personality.Another tiny dancer is Parisa Khobdeh, a dark Iranian-American beauty who joined in 2003 and moves with big clarity, gulping space with a vengeance that is somehow tender and warm. During the jumping competition in ''Airs'' Ms. Khobdeh was all exuberance.Amy Young, who joined in 2000, is a relative veteran. She lands on the sunny side of tall and blond and possesses a strong instrument in both her expansive upper body and her steely legs. Her presence, especially as the striking central figure in ''Polaris,'' was full of dignified stature, enhanced by a supple, buoyant delicacy. Also showcased this season was Eran Bugge, who became a member in 2005 and performed the solo ''Quatre'' in Mr. Taylor's ''Piece Period.'' Though it wasn't much of a dancing role, it did provide proof -- as did her sly portrayal of one of three curly-headed Cupids in ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced)'' -- that she is an actress, possibly with a proclivity for Mr. Taylor's prized screwball roles.Ms. Viola, who has danced with the company since 1992, currently reigns over Mr. Taylor's comic parts. Her innumerable gifts include the deceptively difficult ability to dance badly when it is called for, yet it is her skill at imparting the tiniest detail -- for example, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes in ''Troilus and Cressida'' with moody insolence -- that gives her comedy its richness.But Ms. Viola also exemplifies the breadth of Mr. Taylor's opposing visions. Just as she is able to transform a ridiculous character into a three-dimensional treasure, she probes the depths of darker works like ''Promethean Fire'' and ''Lines of Loss'' with a veiled, profound solemnity.In many ways Ms. Mazzini embodies both sides of Mr. Taylor as well, though with her there is never any concealment: she dances on the edge of reason. With her broad shoulders and tiny feminine waist she is a mixture of graceful curves and determined strength. Night after night Ms. Mazzini was astounding in a broad assortment of dances, including ''Piazzolla Caldera,'' ''Aureole,'' ''Company B,'' ''Profiles'' and ''Sunset.''Still, nothing surpassed the demonic way she threw herself into a slide across the stage in ''Esplanade.'' It summed up everything Ms. Mazzini is: fearless, scary, funny, romantic, sexy and unapologetically expressive. She's like the big guitar solo at a rock concert: It may not be the whole song, but it's the part you never forget.DANCE</text></article><article id="1835392"><summary>Article profiles Danish director Susanne Bier, whose new film After The Wedding opens soon; photos (L)</summary><text>THERE'S something about the way the Danish director Susanne Bier says the word ''comfortable'' that tells you a lot. She's trying to explain why, even though she likes working with actors she knows, she always casts unfamiliar ones too. ''I've got this fear of becoming comfortable,'' she says, carefully pronouncing all four syllables and letting her face, her tone and her body language convey complete distaste.You could guess as much from her recent movies, in which happy, comfortable characters are jolted by events of unfathomable sadness. In ''Open Hearts'' (2002) a devastating automobile accident smashes the future of a newly engaged couple. In ''Brothers,'' which won her an audience award at Sundance in 2005, a seasoned soldier endures a horrific captivity that comes close to destroying him and those he loves. And in her latest, the Oscar-nominated ''After the Wedding,'' family secrets wreak havoc in the lives of former lovers who have been apart -- continents apart -- for 20 years.That film (which opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles) stars Mads Mikkelsen, the cold-eyed villain of ''Casino Royale,'' as a Dane who has been helping to run an orphanage in the slums of Mumbai. His life takes a 180-degree turn when a Danish tycoon (Rolf Lassgard) offers the orphanage a large contribution but insists that the expatriate return home to pick it up himself. A seemingly casual invitation for the visitor to attend the wedding of the businessman's daughter reveals that despite their very different circumstances, the two men have much in common.Catastrophe is always right around the corner in her movies. But Ms. Bier, whose last name rhymes with peer and who pronounces her first name su-ZAHN-a, is herself decidedly cheery. In New York to edit her first English-language movie, ''Things We Lost in the Fire,'' she's taking a break near the Midtown postproduction facility where she has been poring over freeze frames of Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro in yet another story of family disruption and pain. Strikingly pretty and easily carrying off a pair of tight jeans at the age of 46, she says there's nothing autobiographical about her dark themes.''I've had a very fortunate, very privileged life,'' she says. ''I say it with all humility, because it could change tomorrow. But I have a very strong ability to empathize, to understand what things feel like.''It's a quality her collaborators have noticed. The writer and director Anders Thomas Jensen calls it her ''humanness'' and says, ''She's very good at putting herself in a character's place, which is really a gift.''Mr. Mikkelsen, who played a tormented doctor in ''Open Hearts'' before he took the role of Jacob in ''After the Wedding,'' says he spent many draining days trying to evoke the emotion that Ms. Bier was looking for at a given moment. On the phone from Denmark, he says, ''She is very aware of human nature in general, and she can tell when it's not there.'' Sometimes it's not there for 10 hours at a stretch, he says. But, he adds, ''it's comfortable to know we're not leaving the scene until it feels right.''There's that word again: ''comfortable.'' Maybe it's a Danish thing, this finding comfort in the uncomfortable. Mr. Jensen, who wrote the scripts for Ms. Bier's last three films, is in New York to work on their next project, about the Holocaust. They like to hole up together to hammer out the stories. ''Then,'' he says, ''I rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.'' He agrees that neither one of them is particularly morose. ''Every time we start doing a script,'' he notes with a laugh, ''we say, 'Now we have to do a comedy.' But we never end up doing a comedy. Somehow when we work together, we go in that other direction. I don't know why.''Ms. Bier has a suggestion about why her films are the way they are, with their keen portrayal of both happiness and despair. ''I think that being Jewish has generated an extremely strong sense of the importance of family,'' she says. ''If I look at my Scandinavian colleagues, they don't have that urgency about family. All my movies are about that.'' And, she adds, she doesn't think she would be the director she is if she hadn't had her children, a son who is 17 and a daughter who is 11.Her Jewish heritage left her with another legacy. Her father fled Germany with his family in 1933. ''They were part of German society,'' she says of her grandparents. ''They had a lot of non-Jewish friends. And then suddenly society turned against them. I think the lack of automatically feeling, 'Yes, the future is going to be like the present' -- that is very much a Jewish thing.''And it certainly is the operating principle of her films. In ''After the Wedding,'' which was a box-office hit in Denmark and which earned its Oscar nomination in the foreign-language category, Jacob's surrogate family in India is as susceptible to loss as the wealthy family in Denmark. And its sunny newlyweds have only the briefest of honeymoons before an almost casual betrayal sours the marriage.Despite the painful situations she explores, Ms. Bier says she is scrupulous about ending her movies on a hopeful note. And she makes it a point not to alienate audiences. ''I do believe that movies need to have an ability to communicate,'' she says. ''For me moviemaking is not pure art. It is a mass medium, even if it should be artistically coherent. I've had a lot of spanking from my European colleagues. They really don't agree. But I believe that.''Nonetheless she also embraces the ''nuclear bomb'' that the Dogme theorists, led by her countryman Lars von Trier, exploded in the film world in 1995. ''They told us we have to get back to basics, to get back to telling stories about human beings for other human beings,'' she says. ''They've been immensely influential.''''Open Hearts'' was a Dogme film, but Ms. Bier says she's too enamored of the ''richness in the language of movies'' to adhere to the austere Dogme aesthetic, which forbids the use of background music, set design and other artificial enhancements. ''We don't necessarily have to obey all the rules,'' she says. ''We've learned the lesson.''Raised in Copenhagen in what she calls an observant Jewish family, she imagined that she would eventually ''marry a Jewish lawyer and have six kids.'' But as she grew older, ''I was looking for something else in life,'' she says. ''Also, all the nice Jewish boys I met were too boring. I was consistently falling in love with not-so-nice non-Jewish boys.''She studied religion, then architecture, which led to an interest in set design. When she started reading scripts, it gradually dawned on her that she wanted to direct them. She graduated from Denmark's state-run film school in 1987 and became part of the small but active Danish film industry.Leaving that cocoon to make ''Things We Lost in the Fire,'' to be distributed by Paramount this year, was not a decision she took lightly. ''As a European director you hear all these horror stories about European directors working in Hollywood,'' she says. ''They've done great movies in their own country, and then they go to America, and you can't even tell that they ever were involved in that movie.''She also worried because she often changes dialogue as she shoots and encourages improvisation. ''I was concerned,'' she says. ''Was my English sufficient for doing that?''She decided to go ahead because she wanted to work with Sam Mendes, who is one of the producers, and she liked the script, by Allan Loeb. Its broken family and extreme emotions offered enough familiarity to offset the challenges of working in a foreign language, in a foreign country, with a crew of 200 instead of 40. In other words, comfortably uncomfortable.FILM</text></article><article id="1835394"><summary>Bernard Holland reviews new CD of Karol Szymanowski's Mazurkas played by Anna Kijanowska, pianist; photo (M)</summary><text>Karol Szymanowski: Mazurkas  Anna Kijanowska, pianist. Dux 0417; CD.ONE of the comforts of listening for a living is, after many years, still to come upon music one ought to know and doesn't. Karol Szymanowski's mazurkas for the piano bring the past forward more fluently than most 20th-century composition. Chopin's legacy is served. Polish folk dance is honored. But this remains piano music that speaks in the present tense as well as the past. The recording, from the Dux label, is played by Anna Kijanowska, an excellent young Polish pianist now teaching at the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia.Mazurkas move basically at three beats to the measure, the first divided evenly or by dotted rhythms or triplets. The form served as Chopin's experimental laboratory, and his 50-odd examples survive as some of his freshest music: fresh in their originality but also fresh because, being less than look-at-me showpieces, they have not been done to death through public overkill.Twenty of Szymanowski's mazurkas are from the mid-1920s, the last two from three years before his death in 1937. Like Chopin he is loyal to sacrosanct notions of musical patriotism but unintimidated by them. Unlike the mazurkas of Chopin, who had the four-measure phrase all but written into his DNA, Szymanowski's defy dance symmetry and expand and contract. The longest are just over three minutes, and a few are under two. Whether meditative, wistful, acidic or just plain noisy, they dance as the past would have them dance, often reinforced by hurdy-gurdy bass notes.The two late mazurkas push folk music deeper beneath the surface. There is less grit and more luxury to the tone and gestures. Both are less close to the earth but very beautiful. The last, though dark in tone, ends with a major chord.BERNARD HOLLANDCLASSICAL RECORDINGS</text></article><article id="1835395"><summary>Allan Kozinn reviews new recording of Rob Schwimmer's Beyond The Sky with the composer on piano and theramin; photo (M)</summary><text>Rob Schwimmer: 'Beyond the Sky'  Rob Schwimmer, pianist and thereminist. NuNoise; CD.ROB SCHWIMMER is best known as a jazz pianist and composer, and as a member of Polygraph Lounge, a boundary-crossing, satirical rock duo (with the guitarist Mark Stewart). But threads of the classical tradition also run through his work, as does the kind of crisp, disciplined keyboard technique that thrives best in rhythmically complex and coloristically varied music.''Beyond the Sky,'' a collection of short pieces and miniature suites, offers a tour of Mr. Schwimmer's musical house, moving from room to room without much concern about whether the material at hand is classical or jazz, improvised or carefully plotted.The Prelude and Postlude that surround a three-movement suite, despite the formality of their titles, are couched in jazz harmonies and played with an off-the-cuff freedom. Yet the suite itself includes a short perpetual-motion finger-breaker, ''Ostinato,'' with roots in Chopin and Bartok; and the alternately graceful and lurching ''Waltz for Clara,'' a tribute to Clara Rockmore, the theremin virtuoso.Overt showpieces are scattered among the 19 works. ''Quicksilver'' and ''Repeated Notes,'' like ''Ostinato,'' are demonstrations of machine-gun speed and clarity. Mr. Schwimmer's unequivocally classical pieces also include ''Double Helix,'' a dense, rhythmically involving work, and ''Inside,'' which makes inventive use of the avant-garde technique of striking the strings inside the piano.You might expect Mr. Schwimmer's ''Hallucinations on Popular Songs'' to be straightforward jazz. Yet alongside jazz signatures like the slurred run of fast grace notes adorning a laconically played melody, Mr. Schwimmer draws on the kind of dark harmonies more typical in Frederic Rzewski's concert music than in jazz. ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime,'' ''Stormy Weather'' and ''All the Things You Are'' dance easily between both worlds.ALLAN KOZINNCLASSICAL RECORDINGS</text></article><article id="1835400"><summary>Article on auditions for replacement actors-puppeteers for Broadway show Avenue Q; audition process described; photo (L)</summary><text>TONIGHT, on the finale of NBC's '' 'Grease': You're the One That I Want,'' television viewers' votes will determine which of four semifinalists will land the two leading roles (that's Sandy and Danny) in this summer's Broadway revival of that 1972 musical.Since January fans of the series have followed along, step by step, through the reality-TV version of a Broadway casting call, which began with a series of open calls (come one, come all auditions) in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles that drew more than 1,000 actors. (As per Actors' Equity Association rules, ''Grease'' held separate auditions for Equity members, which were not televised.) The top Sandy and Danny candidates then participated in training sessions and weekly onstage sing-offs in front of a live audience, after which viewers voted for their favorites. And each week until the semifinals (when viewer votes became decisive), one of the two least popular candidates was cut from the auditions by the show's resident panel of three experts.The neon lights and hyped-up fans of that televised competition could hardly be more different from the atmosphere on a recent morning at Chelsea Studios, a warren of casting and rehearsal rooms on West 26th Street, where casting was under way for the first national tour of ''Avenue Q,'' the Tony-winning musical comedy mixing actors and puppets. Anxious young performers lined the corridors, battling their nerves in eerie quiet.Strategically coiffed and dressed, they clutched water bottles and studied their ''sides'' -- sheets of paper printed with audition lines and songs. Strains of ''Too Darn Hot'' came from behind one closed door. Further down the hallway, a male voice quavered on the high notes of a pop ballad. ''Huh. Meat Loaf at an audition,'' remarked one of the corridor-dwellers, to no one in particular.Some of the hopefuls sat silent, while others broke the tension with chitchat. ''I don't think they're seeing a ton of people,'' a worried-looking young woman said in a low voice. One actor leaned against the closed door, listening in on the audition in progress.The crowd waiting for final callbacks was a quirky looking one. Body types ranged from skinny to ample. Diminutive men and towering women were among the finalists. Frayed jeans, T-shirts and hipster sneakers were the uniform of choice, though some of the actors had dressed like their characters: denim overalls for the female candidates for Gary Coleman (a role without a puppet), a sweater vest and button-down shirt for at least one aspiring Princeton (a puppeteering role). A few had rolling suitcases in tow; they had flown in at their own expense and would fly back to their out-of-town jobs directly from the audition.The 26 names on the sign-in list represented the product of years of auditions. Cindy Tolan, the show's casting director, said she had culled the finalists from some 3,000 ''Avenue Q'' auditions over more than four years. For the first national tour alone she conducted four days of Equity auditions, two open calls (one in New York and one in Los Angeles) and 12 days of scheduled auditions for actors referred by agents, during which she and an associate saw more than 20 actors per day. At this stage the creative team had already been able to fill most of the parts with alumni from the Broadway and Las Vegas productions of ''Avenue Q.'' Today two parts and several understudy jobs were still up for grabs, each of which carried a salary of no less than $1,465 a week.On the other side of the ''Avenue Q'' door lay a spare, brightly lighted studio, with only a piano, a pair of music stands and two very long tables. On one table lay a collection of the show's signature puppets, a hodgepodge of hot-pink feathers, blue sequins and fluffy brown fur. Behind the other table sat 9 of the 10 people who would weigh in on the final casting decisions. (The 10th and most influential -- the show's 36-year-old director, Jason Moore -- had been called out of town on another directing job and was scheduled to join later by conference call.)A glance down the table took in the production's funky-looking creative team: Ms. Tolan, three writers, two producers and the show's music supervisor, general manager and resident director. They in turn were flanked by an accompanist at the piano and a casting associate at a desk, who would read with the actors.The contemporary audition room may be a far cry from the iconic image of the Broadway tryout -- that romantic darkened theater from which the director's disembodied voice drifts up to the lone actor onstage -- but these days in New York the Chelsea Studios setup is routine. Actors are accustomed to auditioning 10 feet from a long row of critical eyes, fully exposed under strong fluorescent lights.The procession of hopefuls began shortly after 10 a.m. Saum Eskandani, an appealing young man with expressive eyebrows, auditioned for an understudy part wearing jeans and a baggy sweater. Ms. Tolan had found him at a non-Equity open call in Los Angeles, and against considerable odds he had advanced all the way to the final round. (Over the years several of the members of the Broadway ''Avenue Q'' cast have come from open calls, completing casting's equivalent of the Cinderella story.)Evan Ensign, the company's resident director, told Mr. Eskandani to ignore the puppet for the first song, since he had not yet had the chance to attend Mr. Ensign's seminars on puppeteering. Later, as he put on two different puppets in succession (his desired role, like many of those in ''Avenue Q,'' is doubled), the panel watched intently to make sure he had the basics down: lip-synching, keeping the puppet's head turning at the same rate as his own. (''If the puppet doesn't come easily,'' Ms. Tolan said, speaking from experience, ''it's not going to happen.'')Late in the morning Maggie Lakis, a young blond Equity member in a midriff-baring black sweater and gray wool pants, provided a case study in the power of showing range. The spunky Ms. Lakis began by performing an impressive rendition of the ballad ''There's a Fine, Fine Line'' with the Kate Monster puppet on her arm. Still, something about Ms. Lakis's performance nagged at Stephen Oremus, the show's boyish-looking music supervisor. Rising from his seat, he went to her and quietly gave her instructions. She was to sing the number again, without the puppet, and ''make it more of a conversation,'' while building the song ''as if you're figuring these things out as you go.''Mr. Oremus returned to his spot behind the table. When Ms. Lakis began again, the transformation was unmistakable. What had been a presentation deepened into an intimate, honest communication with the people at the table, who sat transfixed until the end, when several of them applauded. ''That was beautiful,'' Mr. Oremus said.After Ms. Lakis left the room, the panel murmured its approval. Her midaudition transformation counted strongly in her favor; she was pronounced ''very directable,'' a high compliment. Ms. Lakis got her understudy slot.As the morning drew to a close, Carla Renata, an Energizer Bunny of a comedian with a big ponytail, giant hoop earrings and an impressive r&#233;sum&#233;, made a splash as Gary Coleman. ''Put her in a 3,000-seat theater, and she's going to hit the back wall,'' said Robyn Goodman, one of the show's producers, with obvious satisfaction. ''We're going to big theaters, and she's a primary color.''Over a quick lunch of cold sandwiches and salads, the creative team spoke of deliberately creating a forgiving atmosphere for the actors, who prepare approximately 15 minutes of songs and lines just to be considered for ''Avenue Q.'' The panel greets the rare cracked note or dropped line with equanimity, the better to calm the actors, whose well-concealed nervousness is occasionally betrayed by a shaking piece of paper or a fleetingly glimpsed drenched underarm.''There's already adrenaline pumping, because they want to get a job,'' Mr. Ensign said. ''You're not going to get anybody's best work if you set them on edge. What I want to find out from an audition is that an actor is directable and that she has a range, a place to go to beyond what she did today.''As the day wore on, the pressure to find the next Princeton -- the show's leading man -- increased. It became clear that there were many categories of near miss. Some gave subpar auditions; others failed to capture the role's tricky blend of innocence and wry humor. One candidate lacked warmth; another had trouble with puppet basics. One Princeton had obvious star quality, but there were doubts about whether he possessed the vocal stamina to handle eight shows a week. Some of the candidates played Princeton convincingly, but were not as good at the role doubled by the actor playing Princeton, the gay Republican puppet Rod.When the 26th actor had left the room, Mr. Ensign collected the head shots of the group's top picks and tacked them to the wall. As the discussion progressed, he moved various photos higher and lower, seeking a loose consensus. The panel chose the memorable Ms. Renata to play Gary Coleman on the tour. Some finalists were hired as understudies, while others were designated promising candidates for future ''Avenue Q'' casting calls.At this point in the process, the Princeton pool widened. To the candidates who had been seen in the room, the panel added a few former cast members of the show's Broadway and Las Vegas productions who might be available to go on the road.The discussion grew heated. Despite the panel's four years of shared history with ''Avenue Q,'' this time its members did not agree, even after a teleconference with Mr. Moore, the director.The solution? More auditions. Mr. Moore decided to call back a select few Princetons for another round the following week, the better for the panel to weigh its options.''That's the whole thing about casting,'' Ms. Tolan said, with surprising cheerfulness for a woman who had seen hundreds of talented Princetons in the lead-up to this day. ''You work with deadlines, and in this case you theoretically have until the first day of rehearsal. So if it wasn't clear today, we'll go right back into auditions.''THEATER</text></article><article id="1835403"><summary>Amnesty International member Gerry Wallman letter, on behalf of other members, about March 11 article on visit to Myanmar</summary><text>To the Editor: Regarding ''Myanmar: A Culinary Odyssey, on a Path Blazed by Orwell'' (Explorer, March 11): As members of Amnesty International local groups 9, 11 and 280 in New York, we have been working for the release of prisoners of conscience who are being held under the most brutal conditions in the Union of Myanmar (Burma) solely for the peaceful expression of their beliefs.While Amnesty International takes no stand as to whether travel to Myanmar is desirable or not, we as Amnesty members do feel it is essential that anyone interested in traveling to Myanmar be given a balanced and comprehensive picture of conditions there.The ruling powers in Myanmar have made clear their determination to ignore internationally recognized human rights standards.

As higher primates, we continue to make valiant attempts to decipher what we conveniently refer to as ''the universe.'' Yet we are limited by our sensory and cognitive capacity, even with all of the mechanical extenders thus far devised.I'm left with renewed respect, and even warmth, for the physicists who are pushing the envelope.

Many believe that we just don't have the mathematics to attack the issues he describes.Advances in math have traditionally led to breakthroughs in physics. When Newton and Leibniz developed calculus, we could finally describe many phenomena that were otherwise unintelligible. The search for a more fundamental theory of the universe that would tie together gravity and quantum behavior along with dark matter and energy is hopeless until we have a better mathematical tool set.

Spring is not really a time of optimistic budding, of vernal renewal. It is the season of grunge.The first bright shafts of light illuminate too much; sunshine exposes streaks, all manner of winter muck. Sitting in the kitchen of my house, I feel the call to battle against dirt. A primitive pride wells up within me, perhaps as the sap rises in the tired bare maples outside my window. I will clean house! I head for the caustic chemicals with a wild glee.I have drudge in me. My Eastern European forebears were great rug-beaters and on-their-knees scrubbers; they cleaned with near-violence, swinging twig brushes and pounding washboards. Perhaps a genetic predisposition, a domestic masochism, takes over during cleaning season. Or does it hark back even further, to the cave and the need to clean out the wastes of winter? I have experienced surges of Cro-Magnon Woman power.The basic drudge-a-thon can be divided into inside and outside jobs, ''deep'' cleaning and surface. The ultimate inside jobs involve areas one normally does not even notice, let alone clean. I eschew most modern improvements -- I don't have a Swiffer. My DustBuster is busted. I go for scullery maid all the way, and take grim satisfaction in it.I am haunted by the women of my childhood, who had a show-and-tell style of spring cleaning. My aunt would lie in wait for family members so that she could display the rubber grooves of her refrigerator seal: ''Look at all the carbon I removed!'' She would show off soiled rags and paper towels, crying, ''See this gook!'' Then she would demonstrate the ''after'': ovens with all burned sediment removed, now-gleaming stove-top burners, and, in the big picture, cleaned windows, de-sooted windowsills, and -- the ultimate triumph -- Venetian blinds, dusted slat by slat. I can't say that my aunt inspired me; I found her limited, to be honest. But she knew what she was doing. I understood, too, her despair over dirt, and why she would shriek, ''I just cleaned that!''Filth is a vital, renewing resource that can break the back and spirit of anyone who tries to defeat it. But I have to try. I start with the most unpleasant tasks first, just to make myself miserable. This usually means the mudroom, which at my house lives up to its name.My mudroom is not a chic entryway, with cute hooks and shelves. It is a foul chamber where an eyeless rodent once died in the cat's water dish, and I didn't notice until company came. There is a litter box there, too, which the cat will reject if it isn't clean enough for her. It is a place where spider eggs hang by the dozen, hatching not cute ''Charlotte's Web'' types, but ones that resemble mini-tarantulas.So to this mud-caked, nasty corner of hell I go full tilt, with a mop and steaming bucket of some astringent cleanser reeking of pine. ''Throw in Clorox, too'' is a principle I adhere to -- anything that makes eyes sting and nostrils flare and burn. I use a mop that lets me scald my hands while squeezing the caustic chemicals from the mop head. I want to end up with raw red knuckles. And don't forget housemaid's knee; if I kneel long enough on the wet mudroom floor, my knees will attest to these devoted attentions.On to the Black Hole of Calcutta: the oven. Even though I own a self-cleaning oven, I don't allow it to do the job. I have to take over. I have tried the self-cleaning feature, and I feel a sick draw on my insides as the oven hums and its detritus self-immolates. It seems to suck the strength from the marrow of my bones, from the ions of my home. There is some electromagnetic force field there that I resent.Hence, drudge do-it-yourself oven cleaning: assume the kneeling position, poke head in oven, slather on noxious oven cleaner, let it settle and blister in its queasy interaction. Then swipe away by hand, paper towel after paper towel, as the layers of oven sludge are removed. When done at last, back out of oven and vow never again to overlook bubbling-up pies or bursting yams -- whatever food left the caramelized formations on the oven floor. Now, soaped clean, the racks and oven floor receive a shining new mat of aluminum foil, all past abrasions concealed. It is a fresh start for the oven.After a head-in-the-oven job, indoor-outdoor tasks seem positively refreshing.How about those windows? I have considered buying new windows just to get clean ones. This would let me avoid the teams of professional window cleaners who swoop through the house en masse, standing on baseboard heating vents and occasionally cracking glass.Such invasions are not welcome, even in the crunch. I will do it myself, I say, in full martyr-matrondom. But the reality is that window-washing is a two-person job (at least), and that means, in my house, the drafting of children. This becomes an exercise in delegation -- of placing one child outside, one inside, and giving each her own spray bottle of exciting aqua window cleaner.The younger the children, the more they accept this. Now that my two are teenagers, once they step out the door to wash the outside windows, they notice the ossified bird droppings everywhere and, shrieking, try to flee back to the cocoon of instant messaging, texting, multi-viewing. What I do next tests their mettle and my own: I unplug the children and remind them of their domestic destiny. No MP3 players or DVDs until the house gleams, inside and out.They, too, must learn the painful pleasures of cleaning. It is time to pass the bucket.HOME WORK Laura Shaine Cunningham is the author of ''Sleeping Arrangements'' and ''A Place in the Country.''</text></article><article id="1835424"><summary>Joanne Starkey reviews Besito restaurant in Roslyn, NY; photos (M)</summary><text>WHEN Besito opened in Huntington a year ago, it changed the way Long Islanders viewed Mexican restaurants. This was no spare storefront with an earnest but limited kitchen. Nor was it one of the chains serving Tex-Mex favorites and combination plates, where everything tastes the same. Besito was an upscale, elegant spot with exciting food. It immediately flew to the head of the class as the Island's best Mexican restaurant.Can its owner, John Tunney, repeat his success? The restaurant-going public is understandably skeptical of sequels, but the new Besito, which opened in January in Roslyn, is a winner. Its menu is the same as that in Huntington; Matthew Lake, the executive chef here, was the opening chef there. His r&#233;sum&#233; includes Rosa Mexicano in Manhattan and Red Sage in Washington.The staff members, trained by experienced servers from the sister restaurant, are first rate. They are whizzes when it comes to the menu, with its many intricate dishes, complex sauces and exotic ingredients. Additionally, they leave on the table a printed glossary of chilies, sauces and spices.Both Besitos are beautiful restaurants, but the newcomer wins the crown. One stucco wall, which runs the length of the restaurant, consists of 150 niches, each holding a flickering candle. (They are battery powered and are charged every night.) Floors are dark wood, and the ceiling an arresting combination of eucalyptus reeds and rough-hewn beams. Wrought-iron chandeliers dot the room; still, the lighting is muted, and the helpful staff members pass out tiny keychain flashlights for those who can't see to read the menu.Start your mini-fiesta with the guacamole, created at tableside to diners' specifications; a companion who hates cilantro was delighted to have it omitted. The chunky treat is served in the rustic mortar and pestle, called a molcajete, in which it is made.We were especially taken with the queso fundido, a molten mass of baked Chihuahua cheese with chilies, chorizo, cilantro and white onion. The tasty mixture was made to be piled on the soft, warm tortillas that accompanied the dish.The quesadilla, deeply charred from the grill and filled with string cheese, roasted green chilies, squash blossoms, mushrooms and salsa verde, was another splendid opener that was big enough to share.Listen closely to the description of the ceviche of the day. The night we tried it, the seafood included baby shrimp, lobster and tiny scallops garnished with avocado and accompanied by plantain and tortilla chips.There were no strikeouts among the entrees, either. Favorites among the roster of hits were the very tender boneless beef short ribs; the fish (mahi-mahi when we tried it) Veracruzana in a mild tomato sauce dotted with peppers, olives and capers; and spicy shrimp ajillo over a sweet plantain sauce.The budin de mariscos was a delicious dish consisting of tortillas layered with shrimp, lump crab and tomato salsa, baked in a mild poblano cream sauce. Another mild, pleasing offering was the Swiss enchiladas: two corn tortillas filled with an abundance of shredded white-meat chicken and baked in a tomatillo cream sauce. That sauce had a vibrant citrus flavor and contained onions, cilantro and melted cheese.Only three desserts were offered, but all won praise. My favorite was the silken pumpkin flan crowned with whipped cream. A bowl of strawberries in a mango cream paired with paper-thin cookies called Marias was another pleaser. Chocolate lovers went for the very moist chocolate tres leches cake.The best dessert was the churros given gratis to every table. The warm, long spirals of fried dough rolled in cinnamon sugar were delivered in a white paper bag. Along with them we were given tiny Mexican ''worry dolls'' to be put under our pillows to take away worries. My only worry was the amount of delicious food I'd just eaten.Besito  1516 Old Northern Boulevard  Roslyn  (516) 484-3001  www.besitomex.comEXCELLENTTHE SPACE -- Beautiful Mexican newcomer in a small shopping center.

One, Raphael's latest cabernet franc, has glimmerings of potential greatness.Some of the most ambitious reds made by Raphael's veteran vintner, Richard Olsen-Harbich, don't unveil themselves readily; they unfold slowly.An explanation may lie partly in his quest for balance, not for easy effect; it is supported by Raphael's consulting enologist from Bordeaux, Paul Pontallier, managing director of the great Ch&#226;teau Margaux, where long-term thinking is de rigueur.Raphael's earthy, meaty 2005 cabernet franc, whose beautiful flavors of macerated berries are starting to be accessible, is a bargain at $18. Ultimately those flavors may become expansive; to accent them today, sip the wine when you eat steak and roast beef.Merlot is Raphael's No. 1 specialty. Instead of making its premium First Label merlot in 2004, Raphael put its top grapes into its secondary Estate Merlot. The wine, benefiting from overnight decanting before being served, is floral, lean, graceful and rather beguiling. At $15, it's a steal.Malbec, Argentina's signature red grape and red wine, is a rarity on the East End. The 2004 Malbec (5 percent merlot) is only Raphael's second such bottling. Medium-bodied, pretty and a little shy now, it offers a pleasantly oaky background and a hint of cedar. Only 80 cases of this $30 treat were made.Petit verdot, a blending grape in Bordeaux, is rarely made as a stand-alone wine anywhere. Raphael's 2004 version (5 percent merlot) is captivating. The wine ($25) is named Vino Pestato, an Italian phrase that Raphael translates as ''wine made by treading.'' The small berries, it says, lend themselves well ''to the ancient technique of foot treading,'' a method used by Raphael to make this wine today. The petit verdot is lithe, rustic, smoky, densely aromatic, spicy and intense. Just 75 cases were produced.A Raphael standby, Bel Rosso (75 percent merlot, 25 percent cabernet franc; $12), is a good accompaniment to ribs, hamburgers, spaghetti and pizza. The light, somewhat austere 2004 version, harboring hints of tar and anise, is noticeably brightened by being chilled for 10 minutes in the refrigerator.LONG ISLAND VINES</text></article><article id="1835426"><summary>Susan H Llewellyn letter about Mar 18 article on importance of context when listening to music</summary><text>To the Editor:The headline of Anthony Tommasini's March 18 article asks ''Can what you know affect what you hear?'' The answer is a resounding yes. Some years ago a friend, irritated by my comments about Alfred Brendel's ''cold, aloof'' playing, made a tape of two performances of Mozart's Piano Concerto in G (K. 453). I was told that one was by Mr. Brendel, and that I was to listen to both at least twice before deciding which one it was. After four sessions I chose unerringly -- wrong.

Were it otherwise, concert attire and program notes would presumably be superfluous. But isn't the underlying reason for this fiasco that today's professional-level classical performances all sound pretty much alike?

There are now a number of really good Indian restaurants in the state, especially in Fairfield County, and many of them do not pull their fiery punches. A case in point is Bombay, formerly Bombay Bar and Grill, in Westport.When this restaurant opened in late 1995, it specialized in four Indian regions and was quite good. Since then it has evolved, brightening its d&#233;cor, adding many vegetarian and vegan entrees, and going for greater depth with dishes from South India and Goa, Calcutta and the North and the Bombay area of west-central India. Two chefs are responsible: Shiva Natarajan, who is also the owner, from South India, and Biplab Barua from the North.Among the star attractions are four chaat dishes. I tried several. Bhel puri is a delicious, unusual starter easily shared by two. It consists of a round layered ''cake'' of puffed rice, diced potatoes, chickpeas and various Indian snack crunchies, seasoned with mint and tamarind chutneys. Diverse flavors and textures explode in the mouth with each bite -- an exuberant and different gustatory sensation. Pani puri is also a contrast of crunch and softness, with a touch of fire and a tamarind sourness.Chaats were not the only surprises. Tamarind eggplant, a starter that combines grilled eggplant ''wheels'' with tamarind and fresh coriander, was a tart and tangy pleasure. Aunt Murli's chingri malai, a Calcutta specialty of jumbo shrimp, raisins and ginger in a creamy, slightly sweet tomato-coconut sauce, was a superlative dish.Goat is becoming more of a local Indian menu staple, and in Bombay's version, chenn goat curry, the large, pungent meat chunks were complemented by a rich, intense curry. Lamb, an Indian mainstay, was at its most vibrant in an incendiary vindaloo and in lamb Madras, spiced with mustard seeds and dry red chilies in a coconut-onion sauce. By contrast, the creamy raisin-bay leaf-cashew sauce in the chicken korma was almost tame, though still modulated and well seasoned. (The only sauce that disappointed me came with the bland vegetarian dish malai kofta. The vegetable balls were mealy and too characterless for my taste, and the raisin-spiked almond sauce was excessively sweet.)There were numerous pleasing side dishes at Bombay: three types of raita (including one with crunchy-fried lotus root); excellent piping-hot garlic nan bread; five types of dal (we liked Bengal's channa dal for its spicy ginger-turmeric-cumin seeds and bay leaf verve); and seven rice dishes. One such was lemon rice, with the added appeal of mustard seeds, roasted peanuts, curry leaves, coconut and lemon.With our entrees came a quartet of harmonizing condiments: mango-pineapple chutney, lemon pickles, lentils and cilantro chutney South Indian style, all of which added extra vigor to the meal.The daily lunch buffet was rather lackluster, even though it was enhanced with a free glass of wine or soda, tandoori chicken, nan and a choice of one of four South Indian dosas. It could not compare with the many lovely revelations of dinner, which is definitely the best time to explore the ever-intriguing menu at Bombay.Bombay616 Post Road East (U.S. 1)  Westport  (203) 226-0211  fineindiandining.comVERY GOODTHE SPACE -- A long storefront decorated in bright colors with pink lotus flowers painted on two eggplant-purple walls.

For one thing, there is no escaping the sweetly pungent aroma of it once you enter the store. For another, a prominently positioned glass display case holds more than 75 types of bonbons, pralines and truffles -- all handmade at the company's Brookfield plant.Among the many cocoa-based creations, which retail for $24.95 a pound, are various nut clusters in both dark and milk chocolate, chocolate-covered caramels, English toffee, mocha cream, orange cream, butter crunch, pecan ''turtles'' and melt-in-the-mouth truffles flavored with raspberry, coffee, Grand Marnier and rum. Bars, in various shapes and weights, are also available, with a box of a dozen milk chocolate ''tulips'' priced at $12.95, while homemade fudge ($12.95 a pound) is offered in a half-dozen flavors, including chocolate walnut and cookies-n-cream.Deborah Ann's also serves hot chocolate, as well as coffee and tea, with three round tables at the front of the establishment provided for sipping and sampling. And at the Candy Bar Creations counter, to the rear of the long rectangular room, Deborah Backes and Michael Grissmer, the owners, have created an attraction especially appealing to children, who, for $8.95, can add a small cup of any candy that catches their fancy to a molten mass of milk or dark chocolate and watch as it is mixed together and formed into a half-pound bar.Deborah Ann's Sweet Shoppe, 381 Main Street, Ridgefield; (203) 438-0065 or deborahanns.com.

But it is much more than hearts and flowers.Drawn from an important collection of American folk art, the show includes roughly 40 objects of folk and decorative art from the 18th and 19th centuries that were made as mementos for beloved family members or friends. Most items on display were created in New England, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and include carvings, books, watercolors, portrait miniatures, needlework, cooking utensils, furniture and several kinds of children's toys. Some are handmade, while others were manufactured by professional craftsmen -- the furniture, for instance, or several important 18th-century folk portraits by the first generation of American portraitists. And pretty much all of them are wonderful things, on a purely aesthetic level, that also tell lots of stories about how Americans lived and raised their children, particularly in the years after the Revolution.Nowhere is this more apparent than in the friendship albums -- sort of combination yearbooks, diaries and photo albums. They were popular in the early 19th century, especially among women, and included drawings, poetry, signatures of friends and even locks of hair. In an era when it was not easy to get photographs or portrait likenesses, hair lockets were a lasting reminder of a family member or friend, and New Year's, Christmas and Valentine's Day were popular times for an exchange of hair lockets and other sentimental tokens.Then there are more unusual items, like a pair of charming little watercolor miniatures on paper of an African-American couple. They are well done, probably painted by J. H. Gillespie around 1838, and show the couple in profile facing each other in an original mahogany-veneered double frame. We don't know who this couple is, though we might surmise that they were very much in love when the painting was completed -- they gaze fondly at each other, smiling.Many displays here relate to children. There is a late 18th-century highchair, rare for this period, since children's furniture did not become widely available until after the Civil War, and a lovely little doll's quilt, of cotton and chintz, made in 1853 in Massachusetts by a loving aunt for Alma D. Crane. Names and snippets of poems are stitched into the quilt, personalizing it for the owner.Portraits of children are in abundance, from circular pendant portraits of the young sisters Mary and Lucy Gay, painted circa 1780, the artist unknown, to Sheldon Peck's odd, three-quarter-length 1849 portrait of George Weld Hilliard, perhaps 10 years old at the time, with a trompe-l'oeil frame painted over the canvas edges. Peck's portrait, which depicts the young boy with an outsize right ear and holding a huge red apple, has immense charm, and a certain na&#239;vet&#233;. Apples were traditional symbols of knowledge, though in this case the apple may hint at the family's source of wealth -- they owned orchards.There are also portraits by John Brewster Jr., one of America's most prolific professional portrait painters in the closing decade of the 18th century and early years of the 19th. Born deaf into a prominent family in rural Hampton, Conn., he worked as an itinerant portrait painter, traveling throughout New England in search of commissions among the wealthy merchant class that arose after the Revolution. ''Comfort Starr Mygatt and Lucy Mygatt'' (1799), an unusual daughter-father portrait, is on display here.In this vein are several other watercolors and pencil drawings of family groups, mothers with newborn babies and children playing, all from different times and periods and exhibiting different skill levels. Some of them bear personal inscriptions, like Joseph H. Davis's watercolor of Martha Nelson Furber, 3 years old, holding a book in one hand and a bouquet of cut flowers in the other. It was painted, according to the inscription, as a gift for Martha's favorite instructress -- Miss P. Emily Parsons. It is a heartfelt symbol of gratitude and affection.''Made for Love: Selections from the Jane Katcher Collection of Americana,'' Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, through Aug. 26.

Spring is not really a time of optimistic budding, of vernal renewal. It is the season of grunge.The first bright shafts of light illuminate too much; sunshine exposes streaks, all manner of winter muck. Sitting in the kitchen of my house, I feel the call to battle against dirt. A primitive pride wells up within me, perhaps as the sap rises in the tired bare maples outside my window. I will clean house! I head for the caustic chemicals with a wild glee.I have drudge in me. My Eastern European forebears were great rug-beaters and on-their-knees scrubbers; they cleaned with near-violence, swinging twig brushes and pounding washboards. Perhaps a genetic predisposition, a domestic masochism, takes over during cleaning season. Or does it hark back even further, to the cave and the need to clean out the wastes of winter? I have experienced surges of Cro-Magnon Woman power.The basic drudge-a-thon can be divided into inside and outside jobs, ''deep'' cleaning and surface. The ultimate inside jobs involve areas one normally does not even notice, let alone clean. I eschew most modern improvements -- I don't have a Swiffer. My DustBuster is busted. I go for scullery maid all the way, and take grim satisfaction in it.I am haunted by the women of my childhood, who had a show-and-tell style of spring cleaning. My aunt would lie in wait for family members so that she could display the rubber grooves of her refrigerator seal: ''Look at all the carbon I removed!'' She would show off soiled rags and paper towels, crying, ''See this gook!'' Then she would demonstrate the ''after'': ovens with all burned sediment removed, now-gleaming stove-top burners, and, in the big picture, cleaned windows, de-sooted windowsills, and -- the ultimate triumph -- Venetian blinds, dusted slat by slat. I can't say that my aunt inspired me; I found her limited, to be honest. But she knew what she was doing. I understood, too, her despair over dirt, and why she would shriek, ''I just cleaned that!''Filth is a vital, renewing resource that can break the back and spirit of anyone who tries to defeat it. But I have to try. I start with the most unpleasant tasks first, just to make myself miserable. This usually means the mudroom, which at my house lives up to its name.My mudroom is not a chic entryway, with cute hooks and shelves. It is a foul chamber where an eyeless rodent once died in the cat's water dish, and I didn't notice until company came. There is a litter box there, too, which the cat will reject if it isn't clean enough for her. It is a place where spider eggs hang by the dozen, hatching not cute ''Charlotte's Web'' types, but ones that resemble mini-tarantulas.So to this mud-caked, nasty corner of hell I go full tilt, with a mop and steaming bucket of some astringent cleanser reeking of pine. ''Throw in Clorox, too'' is a principle I adhere to -- anything that makes eyes sting and nostrils flare and burn. I use a mop that lets me scald my hands while squeezing the caustic chemicals from the mop head. I want to end up with raw red knuckles. And don't forget housemaid's knee; if I kneel long enough on the wet mudroom floor, my knees will attest to these devoted attentions.On to the Black Hole of Calcutta: the oven. Even though I own a self-cleaning oven, I don't allow it to do the job. I have to take over. I have tried the self-cleaning feature, and I feel a sick draw on my insides as the oven hums and its detritus self-immolates. It seems to suck the strength from the marrow of my bones, from the ions of my home. There is some electromagnetic force field there that I resent.Hence, drudge do-it-yourself oven cleaning: assume the kneeling position, poke head in oven, slather on noxious oven cleaner, let it settle and blister in its queasy interaction. Then swipe away by hand, paper towel after paper towel, as the layers of oven sludge are removed. When done at last, back out of oven and vow never again to overlook bubbling-up pies or bursting yams -- whatever food left the caramelized formations on the oven floor. Now, soaped clean, the racks and oven floor receive a shining new mat of aluminum foil, all past abrasions concealed. It is a fresh start for the oven.After a head-in-the-oven job, indoor-outdoor tasks seem positively refreshing.How about those windows? I have considered buying new windows just to get clean ones. This would let me avoid the teams of professional window cleaners who swoop through the house en masse, standing on baseboard heating vents and occasionally cracking glass.Such invasions are not welcome, even in the crunch. I will do it myself, I say, in full martyr-matrondom. But the reality is that window-washing is a two-person job (at least), and that means, in my house, the drafting of children. This becomes an exercise in delegation -- of placing one child outside, one inside, and giving each her own spray bottle of exciting aqua window cleaner.The younger the children, the more they accept this. Now that my two are teenagers, once they step out the door to wash the outside windows, they notice the ossified bird droppings everywhere and, shrieking, try to flee back to the cocoon of instant messaging, texting, multi-viewing. What I do next tests their mettle and my own: I unplug the children and remind them of their domestic destiny. No MP3 players or DVDs until the house gleams, inside and out.They, too, must learn the painful pleasures of cleaning. It is time to pass the bucket.HOME WORK Laura Shaine Cunningham is the author of ''Sleeping Arrangements'' and ''A Place in the Country.''</text></article><article id="1835442"><summary>Article on Connecticut artist Jan Beekman, who comments on his portrait of Nelson Mandela that hangs at United Nations; photos (M)</summary><text>JAN BEEKMAN'S landscape paintings have been described as a meditation on the environment. While not realistic portrayals of forests or canyons, the canvases often measure six feet high and feature the impression, colors and textures of the nature that inspired them. There are the grays, browns and muted yellows of the winter woods outside his home near the Preston-Ledyard town line. There are the sweeps of earthy reds from the buttes of the Southwest and repeated dabs of inky green and blue that suggest a bubbling, springtime river in New England.It was a face, however, that touched Mr. Beekman so deeply that he had to create 15 small portraits before finding the tones and technique to convey its message adequately. It was the face of Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa.Mr. Beekman's efforts culminated in a 6-foot-by-6-foot portrait that now hangs at the United Nations. It was dedicated as a gift from the Belgian mission in a United Nations ceremony this month at which the president of the Mandela Foundation spoke.The portrait is meant to depict Mr. Mandela as he appeared on Feb. 11, 1990, the day he was released from prison. He was 71 and had been imprisoned for 27 years by the white-controlled South African government for his work with the African National Congress liberation movement and its fight against apartheid. The conflict and tensions surrounding Mr. Mandela's imprisonment had been intense in Europe. Mr. Beekman, a native of Belgium, and his British wife, Gillian Lane-Plescia, had followed it closely there, as well as in the United States, after Mr. Beekman became the artist-in-residence at the University of Michigan in 1982.When Mr. Mandela was released from prison, the couple, then living in Chicago, rose at 4 a.m. to watch the televised coverage of the event.''It was an amazing moment,'' Ms. Lane-Plescia said. ''There was all this tension and stress at the time of his release.''Mr. Beekman, 77, who calls Mr. Mandela the greatest leader of the 20th century, said he was particularly struck by his calm, peaceful demeanor amid the hundreds of thousands of cheering, exuberant supporters as well as the riot police, who sometimes brutally controlled the raucous crowd that had gathered to hear Mr. Mandela speak.Mr. Mandela's calm is what Mr. Beekman said he strove to capture on canvas. ''He came out of prison like a stone,'' Mr. Beekman said. ''The problem was to get from a very realistic portrait to something that was artwork. There was despair, but I wanted the painting to be more about hope.''The result was a monochromatic work in tones ranging from sandy beige to deep brown. The focus of the portrait is Mr. Mandela's eyes.After completing the portrait, Mr. Beekman said it remained out of sight for years because he considered it too delicate to be exposed to the public. When an art historian saw the portrait in Mr. Beekman's studio about two years ago, however, she was so impressed that she persuaded him to begin the process of donating it to the United Nations through the Belgian mission.The United Nations' mission to work for world peace, human rights, justice and individual dignity made it the perfect place to display the portrait of a man who dedicated his life to ending the political and social system of apartheid, Ms. Lane-Plescia said.''There is not a direct connection between Belgium and Mr. Mandela,'' she said. ''But they recognized what an iconic painting it is.''One of Mr. Beekman's smaller portraits of Mr. Mandela hangs in the couple's home. Stand close to the portrait and the heavily textured brushstrokes and paint daubs in greens and blacks appear to be one of the more abstract landscapes on display throughout their home. Take a few steps back, however, and Mr. Mandela's face, with its calm and soulful eyes, takes shape.''My paintings are very textural and so are the portraits,'' Mr. Beekman said.He added that the message of peace and hope he conveyed in the portrait hanging at the United Nations is one he hopes to spread though his other art as well.The Beekman Foundation, which he founded to conserve his art, is collaborating with a group of artists from around the globe to put together an exhibition dedicated to saving the environment from the scourge of wars and other threats, he said. Plans have not been completed, but the show is expected to open in a gallery in the United States before the end of the year.''The mission is peace,'' Ms. Lane-Plescia said.ARTIST</text></article><article id="1835447"><summary>Editorial supports decision to drop proposal to build Super 7 highway between Norwalk and Danbury, Conn</summary><text>The recent rejection of a proposed bill to build the ''Super 7'' highway between Norwalk and Danbury is a blow to advocates fighting for the expressway and to commuters who have the misfortune to crawl along in the traffic jams that plague the current Route 7.The State Legislature's transportation committee tabled the bill despite passionate testimony from both sides. People have been fighting over this multi-lane expressway for 57 years; it has never gotten off the drawing boards. Opponents, including environmentalists, have had good reason to block it.To go ahead with the project now is simply unrealistic. The area has too many wetlands, and even without the headache of obtaining environmental permits, the state would have to purchase up to 50 percent of the land. The price tag would be between $1 billion and $2 billion.The state would be better off investing in mass transit and finding ways to get cars off the roads. For years, Connecticut has acted as if it had only one option for transportation: pavement. That's changing now, and it's high time.Every region of the state has cherished highway projects -- like the completion of Route 11 in southeastern Connecticut -- that, to the frustration of local residents, haven't come to pass. If the state were to finish them all, we'd have miles more pavement, millions of dollars more debt, and there would still be too many cars on the road.Connecticut</text></article><article id="1835449"><summary>Laura Shaine Cunningham Home Work essay on painful pleasures of spring cleaning; drawing (M)</summary><text>AS grime obscures my domain, I see through the window glass darkly.

And don't forget housemaid's knee; if I kneel long enough on the wet mudroom floor, my knees will attest to these devoted attentions.On to the Black Hole of Calcutta: the oven. Even though I own a self-cleaning oven, I don't allow it to do the job. I have to take over. I have tried the self-cleaning feature, and I feel a sick draw on my insides as the oven hums and its detritus self-immolates. It seems to suck the strength from the marrow of my bones, from the ions of my home. There is some electromagnetic force field there that I resent.Hence, drudge do-it-yourself oven cleaning: assume the kneeling position, poke head in oven, slather on noxious oven cleaner, let it settle and blister in its queasy interaction. Then swipe away by hand, paper towel after paper towel, as the layers of oven sludge are removed. When done at last, back out of oven and vow never again to overlook bubbling-up pies or bursting yams -- whatever food left the caramelized formations on the oven floor. Now, soaped clean, the racks and oven floor receive a shining new mat of aluminum foil, all past abrasions concealed. It is a fresh start for the oven.After a head-in-the-oven job, indoor-outdoor tasks seem positively refreshing.How about those windows? I have considered buying new windows just to get clean ones. This would let me avoid the teams of professional window cleaners who swoop through the house en masse, standing on baseboard heating vents and occasionally cracking glass.Such invasions are not welcome, even in the crunch. I will do it myself, I say, in full martyr-matrondom. But the reality is that window-washing is a two-person job (at least), and that means, in my house, the drafting of children. This becomes an exercise in delegation -- of placing one child outside, one inside, and giving each her own spray bottle of exciting aqua window cleaner.The younger the children, the more they accept this. Now that my two are teenagers, once they step out the door to wash the outside windows, they notice the ossified bird droppings everywhere and, shrieking, try to flee back to the cocoon of instant messaging, texting, multi-viewing. What I do next tests their mettle and my own: I unplug the children and remind them of their domestic destiny. No MP3 players or DVDs until the house gleams, inside and out.They, too, must learn the painful pleasures of cleaning.

Inside this cellar enclave, a mirrored wall that runs through the bar and lounge reflects the dazzle and sparkle of an extensive collection of glass and crystal: tall decanters, Swarovski figures, vases. The bilevel dining room, just beyond the lounge area, looks out onto an attractive garden and waterfall. The food, however, was generally less successful than the view.Even the generous freebies, the delight of so many diners, were a tad tired; the best was a bruschetta heaped with a tangy, garlicky tomato salad. Hunks of Parmesan mined from a huge wheel, wafers of hard salami and limp, oil-soaked fried zucchini were less appealing.A few appetizers rated top marks, including a salad of baby greens encircled with leaves of endive and laced with dressing scented with white truffle oil, and a pretty arrangement of smoked salmon, trout (scallops promised but absent), chopped egg, capers and onion. Crab cakes were standard fare.Shrimp used here are colossal -- the menu notes them to be five to the pound. Almost impossible to overcook, they retained their meaty crispness, and although we found the dish too sweet, many diners will enjoy them encased in a thick, crunchy crust of coconut and served with a hot mustard sauce. A duo of baked clams and garlicky shrimp, while hardly subtle, nonetheless worked as well.Pastas came in some winning combinations. Rigatoni Bolognese was outstanding, the hollow, ridged macaroni perfect for capturing a sauce rich with meats finely chopped (not pulverized, as is the case in some other restaurants). A few mushrooms added even more depth of flavor, and a mere dash of cream smoothed the result. Half orders of pasta are available for a first course, but nondieters would be happy with a whole portion of this classic, for an entree.A simple sauce of tomato and basil went perfectly with supple, fresh pappardelle, and had the diced prosciutto that showered the penne with chopped leek been softer and juicier, this dish (a special) would have been recommendable, too. The only misstep occurred in penne all'arrabbiata, not at all hot and spicy, but rather too salty from olives and inadequately rinsed capers and too vinegary from whole cocktail onions, an unaccountable substitute for plain pearl onions.Entrees had a few successes, one of them juicy salmon Mulino, beautifully saut&#233;ed with shredded onion, shiitakes and a shot of balsamic vinegar. On the other hand, a cooked-out tuna special in a sticky pale sauce was lackluster, a study in beige on beige. Judging from the crisp, colossal appetizer shrimp, choosing a simple shrimp dish as an entree would have been a better bet.Rubbed with horseradish and mustard (with no taste of the promised sage), a rack of lamb yielded four tender chops. But other entrees faltered: overcooked breast of chicken in a thick, saccharine Calvados sauce, tough stuffed pork chop and astringent pork medallions. A thin sirloin steak priced at $42 was chewy and dry, as was osso buco (a special), which was accompanied by gummy rice instead of the promised polenta.A dish of watery potatoes came with the entrees, which are unadorned. We shared a portion of spinach with garlic and oil -- the large leaves a bit tough, and the garlic old and biting.Elaborate desserts kicked in for the big finish. Chocolate lovers should go for the bars of gorgeously soft, smooth chocolate truffle. A mere wafer of sponge cake held together layers of chocolate creams and ganache. Cake from Renaissance Bakery was topped with meringue disks spread with chocolate and mocha creams. With these at hand, why bother with the white chocolate tower, the out-of-season berries or the grainy, bland ricotta cheese cake?Considering the uneven preparations and some slips in maintenance (chair seats sag seriously), Mulino's is expensive. But right now, in the White Plains area, where else is there a hushed, roomy, high-end restaurant for a business meal or a celebration of a special occasion?

And New Rochelle's Little Mexican Cafe offers the genuine article, as you can plainly see if you sit at its worn wooden bar. The electric spit is strung with marinated pork pieces running with the amber juices of the pineapple above. The pork is wrapped in warm corn tortillas along with chopped cilantro and onion. (Ask for a couple of chunks of roasted pineapple to be added to the mix.)Tacos al pastor -- shepherd-style tacos -- originated in the Mexican state of Puebla, which has a significant number of residents of Lebanese heritage, said Rick Bayless, a chef, Chicago restaurateur and authority on Mexican food. The dish originally contained lamb, and the Lebanese version was quite similar to shawarma, gyros or any of the other Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern preparations of spitted lamb and flatbread. Puebla cooks adapted the Lebanese spit technique, creating two signature regional dishes: tacos al pastor and tacos Arabe. In both, the more readily available pork was substituted for lamb. For tacos Arabe, simply seasoned pork is spit-roasted over a wood fire, then sliced and served with yogurt in a pocketless Mexican pita.Edwin and Froyla Almazan, owners of the Little Mexican Cafe, celebrate their Puebla roots with both types of tacos ($2 each) as well as with their family recipe for mole sauce. This is the famous, slow-cooked sauce of Puebla, whose scores of ingredients (including chilies and Mexican chocolate) combine to make a complexly flavored paste. Little Mexican Cafe's mole is available in pollo con mole and over enchiladas filled with cheese, pork, chicken or beef.Little Mexican Cafe, 581 Main Street, New Rochelle, (914) 636-3926.

The statistics you provide show that despite the usual complaints when a railroad experiences problems during a snowstorm or other natural occurrence, commuter railroads are the most reliable mode of transportation for traveling to and from Manhattan.Our country's Achilles' heel is that we are addicted to oil to fuel our automobiles, and thus can be held hostage by the dictators and undemocratic foreign regimes that supply that oil. During crises like a significant increase in the price of oil, our political leaders pay lip service to becoming energy independent and finding alternative energy sources.Those politicians would better serve us by rewarding those who choose to use public transportation. They should increase the subsidies and dedicate significant resources to update, expand and support economical, reliable and environmentally friendly methods of transportation.The more we as a society become committed to public transportation, the stronger we will become.Dean R. Brown  Briarcliff ManorTo the Editor:You quote Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association, as saying, ''Tolls and fares should go up in tandem.''As a retired transportation planner, I would suggest that only peak-period tolls into Manhattan be increased, to a price sufficient to discourage riders from switching from commuter rail to driving into Manhattan.At the same time, while Manhattan-bound tolls are increased, those on the peripheral crossings (the Throgs Neck and Whitestone Bridges) must be lowered. Drivers to destinations outside of Manhattan should be encouraged to circumvent the borough, rather than drive through it. It is inequitable to charge drivers on these routes the same toll as Manhattan-bound vehicles.It is even more unfair to continue to charge weekend and off-peak users of these peripheral crossings the same tolls as peak-period users.David D.

Spring is not really a time of optimistic budding, of vernal renewal. It is the season of grunge.The first bright shafts of light illuminate too much; sunshine exposes streaks, all manner of winter muck. Sitting in the kitchen of my house, I feel the call to battle against dirt. A primitive pride wells up within me, perhaps as the sap rises in the tired bare maples outside my window. I will clean house! I head for the caustic chemicals with a wild glee.I have drudge in me. My Eastern European forebears were great rug-beaters and on-their-knees scrubbers; they cleaned with near-violence, swinging twig brushes and pounding washboards. Perhaps a genetic predisposition, a domestic masochism, takes over during cleaning season. Or does it hark back even further, to the cave and the need to clean out the wastes of winter? I have experienced surges of Cro-Magnon Woman power.The basic drudge-a-thon can be divided into inside and outside jobs, ''deep'' cleaning and surface. The ultimate inside jobs involve areas one normally does not even notice, let alone clean. I eschew most modern improvements -- I don't have a Swiffer. My DustBuster is busted. I go for scullery maid all the way, and take grim satisfaction in it.I am haunted by the women of my childhood, who had a show-and-tell style of spring cleaning. My aunt would lie in wait for family members so that she could display the rubber grooves of her refrigerator seal: ''Look at all the carbon I removed!'' She would show off soiled rags and paper towels, crying, ''See this gook!'' Then she would demonstrate the ''after'': ovens with all burned sediment removed, now-gleaming stove-top burners, and, in the big picture, cleaned windows, de-sooted windowsills, and -- the ultimate triumph -- Venetian blinds, dusted slat by slat. I can't say that my aunt inspired me; I found her limited, to be honest. But she knew what she was doing. I understood, too, her despair over dirt, and why she would shriek, ''I just cleaned that!''Filth is a vital, renewing resource that can break the back and spirit of anyone who tries to defeat it. But I have to try. I start with the most unpleasant tasks first, just to make myself miserable. This usually means the mudroom, which at my house lives up to its name.My mudroom is not a chic entryway, with cute hooks and shelves. It is a foul chamber where an eyeless rodent once died in the cat's water dish, and I didn't notice until company came. There is a litter box there, too, which the cat will reject if it isn't clean enough for her. It is a place where spider eggs hang by the dozen, hatching not cute ''Charlotte's Web'' types, but ones that resemble mini-tarantulas.So to this mud-caked, nasty corner of hell I go full tilt, with a mop and steaming bucket of some astringent cleanser reeking of pine. ''Throw in Clorox, too'' is a principle I adhere to -- anything that makes eyes sting and nostrils flare and burn. I use a mop that lets me scald my hands while squeezing the caustic chemicals from the mop head. I want to end up with raw red knuckles.

There are landscapes, portraits and religious paintings, too, but the still lifes of fruit really lure the viewer.The show was organized by the Museo de Arte de Ponce, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, drawing on paintings from its stellar permanent collection along with loans from museums and private collections. It is acclaimed in the press release as the first exhibition in the United States devoted to these three masters, and it probably is, though works by each of them have been shown rather extensively at other museums in the New York and New Jersey area, notably El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan.With about 40 paintings arranged by artist in chronological order, the show presents an unofficial history of Puerto Rico in paintings. Those with an interest in this subject will dutifully note paintings here commemorating various historical events, beginning with Campeche's ''Governor Don Ram&#243;n de Castro'' (1800), a full-length portrait of the governor that was commissioned by the City Council of San Juan after the successful defense of the colony against an assault by the British in 1797.Campeche depicts the governor in military dress in front of the fort of San Crist&#243;bal. We get the message, but as a work of art it is rather dry. The same goes for many of the other historical and religious paintings here; for that reason, one of the best ways to enjoy this show is to seek out paintings that capture some of the flavor and natural beauty of the island. A good place to start is with the landscape paintings of sugar cane plantations and haciendas in the hilly countryside, as well as the still lifes of tropical fruits.The best of them are by Oller. While Campeche, the son of a slave who bought his freedom, received no formal academic training, Oller traveled as a young man to Europe in the early 1850s to study at various art academies in Madrid. He later went to Paris, then the international capital of the art world, where he met and became friends with Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet and Paul C&#233;zanne.Oller's ''Guayabas'' (circa 1901-1903), an alluring tropical still life of sweet, sensuously fleshy guavas in various states -- attached to the branch, whole, cut open -- reminded me of growing up in Colombia, where I had fried green plantains and a glass of guava juice for breakfast each morning. Writing in the exhibition catalog, Cheryl D. Hartup, the curator, tells us Oller's still lifes owe a debt to 17th-century Spanish ''bodegon'' paintings, still lifes by artists Francisco de Zurbar&#225;n and Diego Vel&#225;zquez, among others. But they were also influenced by C&#233;zanne, with works like ''Guayabas'' reminding you of C&#233;zanne's still lifes of apples -- Oller painted the guavas spilling out of a ceramic bowl onto a tablecloth on a rustic wooden table, much as C&#233;zanne arranged his apples.But to dismiss Oller as a provincial Impressionist would be unfair. He painted beautifully in several genres and styles, as is revealed by his portraits, including a marvelous self-portrait (circa 1889-92) and ''The School of Teacher Rafael Cordero'' (circa 1891). This is an elaborate multifigure tableau that seems to have its formal roots in 16th-century Italian Mannerist religious scenes, but it also has a luminosity and an attention to the details of social interaction that are entirely his own.Oller also painted lovely Puerto Rican landscapes, though he focused on scenes of the island's agriculture, development and modernization. Sugar cane fields and processing factories are prominent subjects in several paintings (which is not surprising given that during the 19th century, sugar cane was the island's main export), along with plantations and harvest scenes. Most of the images have a low horizon, showing off the wide Caribbean sky.Pou also focused on views of Puerto Rico's countryside and rural genre scenes, though with a tangy palette that may strike modern viewers as garish. His paintings are idealizations of a passing world, painted at a time when Puerto Rico was evolving into the modern, industrialized society it is today. But through it all shines that Caribbean light, shimmering on the foliage of trees, their branches heavy with succulent ripe fruit.''Mi Puerto Rico: Master Painters of the Island, 1780-1952,'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, Newark, through April 15.

''You feel like you're running in quicksand. But in that week we built two houses for an extended family, soup to nuts, two houses.''She hopes to carry over some of that momentum to her new position, overseeing New Jersey's largest agency. The Department of Human Services has a budget of $9 billion, more than 16,000 employees and more than a million clients, including welfare and Medicaid recipients, people with mental illness and physical and developmental disabilities.Ms. Velez, who until early February was a deputy commissioner in the department, has a long history of public service. She was the first assistant child advocate in the Office of the Child Advocate when it was created in 2003, after serving three governors in the Office of Governor's Counsel, from 1998 to 2003. There she worked on legislation and regulations for the Human Services Department, helping to create laws governing health insurance for poor families and children and the treatment of homeless youths and abandoned babies.Her appointment as commissioner still is subject to approval by the State Senate's Judiciary Committee. No date has been set for the hearings.Ms. Velez grew up in Bergen County. Her family was on welfare for a while after her parents divorced. She was the first member of her family to attend college, earning degrees from Drew University and the Rutgers School of Law in Newark. Her mother grew up in a foster family and had always wanted to work in foster care.In an interview in her office here, Ms. Velez said, ''If any of my experience growing up -- we were certainly without means -- if that could inform decisions and policy-making here to help us to be very empathetic to our clients and always aware of the antipoverty agenda, that would be a success, in making things come full circle for me.''She is quick to point out that experience with poverty is not a requirement for being empathetic to the plight of the poor. And she has learned firsthand the hard work required of public servants in her field.Kevin M. Ryan, the commissioner of the state's Department of Children and Families and the former child advocate, recounted how tirelessly Ms. Velez worked during the shutdown of state government last summer, when he was head of the Human Services Department and she was a deputy commissioner.Without a state budget and without the money allocated for benefits like food stamps and rent assistance, Ms. Velez had to persuade out-of-state financial institutions to continue issuing checks and honoring benefits cards.''She passionately and aggressively applied herself to the task and secured for thousands of children and families in New Jersey a continued safety net,'' Mr. Ryan said.Ms. Velez remembers those six days as nightmarish. It was nearly impossible to find out how much money was owed on each district office's subcontracts, and she had feared homeless shelters would fill up with people unable to get access to their benefits. To complicate matters, the Delaware River flooded some of the department's offices.She rubbed her eyes as she recalled the three or four days she spent away from her home in Summit and her son and daughter, now 7 and 5.One of her main goals, Ms. Velez said, was to establish a sense of stability in the department, where many of her colleagues have had the word acting added to their titles.''I feel like it's been a great Shakespearean stage, with a bunch of actors,'' she said, smiling. ''Everyone is so willing and primed to do the right thing.'' In a department led by five different commissioners since December 2005, she hopes to ensure that clients are not further disrupted by change.William Waldman, a former human services commissioner who worked with her in the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman, said it bodes well for Ms. Velez's tenure in the job that she is nonpartisan.''I was always struck with her ability to see the big picture, her sense of advocacy, and her concern for the most vulnerable citizens we had,'' Mr. Waldman said.GOVERNMENT</text></article><article id="1835492"><summary>Karla Cook reviews Tom Yum Goong restaurant in Princeton, NJ; photos (M)</summary><text>THE soup was beautiful to see: fat white shrimp touched with coral, juicy tan mushrooms, green bell peppers and kaffir lime leaves, all in a clear broth. And it was beautiful to eat: suffused with shrimp essence and lime, and spiced to leave a tingle in the throat.But then what? I was still hungry and my companion had had nothing at all to eat.We waited. And waited, until his food finally arrived. He ate, and then we waited for the check.The clear shrimp soup for which Tom Yum Goong is named was like the restaurant: tantalizing, but not quite satisfying.The main obstacle was service, which was gracious but, on two of three visits, excruciatingly inefficient. On that lunch-hour visit, after eating my soup -- I had expected a larger portion, along the lines of a lunch special -- I was afraid to order more food because of the wait. Nor did I order more tea. Instead of a pot, an order of tea here is a tea bag, a cup and some warmish water.The food, however, is fresh, served at the proper temperature and mostly well executed -- a good start, needing only a spark (and perhaps a bit of maturity) to transform the restaurant from default to delight.Some of that promise is embodied by Somm Bolsue, who manages his family's restaurant and has faced computer glitches and service problems since the 45-seat restaurant opened in December. He greets customers; he oversees a staff of six cooks who make sauces from scratch. And he said that service was improving. (A later lunch suggested he was on the right track.)Tom Yum Goong is tucked into the driveway of a little shopping complex, but its location hasn't stopped the word-of-mouth recommendations. Tables filled within a couple of days of the opening and have generally stayed that way.The menu is very large and would require multiple visits for a thorough exploration. It begins well, with appetizers like deep-fried fish cakes (tod mun pla) that were tender, not rubbery. Chicken-in-blanket, which might be better named boned, pork-stuffed chicken wings, with bits of carrot, onion, potato and chili paste, disappeared quickly. Chicken satay was tender enough but slightly dry, and neither the peanut sauce nor the onion-cucumber salad served with it was compelling. A dish named golden bags was more successful; the blend of ground shrimp, water chestnuts, button mushrooms, onions, parsley and basil arrived smoking hot in tofu jackets, with the plum sauce a cooling antidote.Soups were very good. Favorites included the tom yum goong and the vegetarian tom yum puck, with mushrooms, celery and onions bathed in a spicy broth sparked with kaffir lime leaves, lime juice, lemon grass, fresh chili peppers and Thai basil. Tom kha gai was satisfying, mostly because of its base of coconut milk and lime juice, which contained plenty of tender chicken morsels. The real winner was the noodle soup with duck, a fragrant revelation, its deep brown broth brimming with rice noodles, barely blanched bits of celery, scallions and fanned-out slices of duck.Salads were good, but missing something that might have made them great. Duck salad with chili paste was well balanced, matched to bell peppers, scallions, red onions, pineapple and ground peanuts. Green papaya salad needed Jersey tomatoes in season, as did the sliced beef salad, which was nevertheless pleasantly bulked up with crisp cucumber and bell peppers.The ubiquitous pad Thai was a touch too sweet and a touch too pale. The lad-nar, with its fried flat noodles and vegetables and squid, was more balanced.Some main dishes, in a presentation similar to that of other Thai restaurants, begin with vegetables, nuts, flavorings and sauces and make the diner figure out which would work best with them: chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, squid or mixed seafood. There are no hints.Other dishes are preordained. Among our favorites: a tender, spicy-yet-sweet deep-fried red snapper with vegetables and tamarind sauce; duck with coconut milk, pineapple and green curry sauce; a steamed whole striped bass with lemon grass and lime juice; spicy seafood in red curry.Desserts are sweet endings that help smooth service glitches; three rice-based treats vied for first place with a banana steamed in coconut milk. Skip the ice cream wrapped in white bread and fried. Unlike Tom Yum Goong, it was not tantalizing.Tom Yum Goong  354 Nassau Street  Princeton  (609) 921-2003  www.tygthai.comGOODTHE SPACE -- Small restaurant with tall windows, high ceilings and a jewel-box interior.

With its tin ceiling and potbelly stove, this old-fashioned outpost in Morris County seems unchanged since 1830, when it first opened. Now, as then, you can stop by for groceries like milk and eggs or to mail a letter (the local post office is inside). But today the store also sells satisfying sandwiches.The signature sandwich here is Pete's Sloppy Joe, which you can order with turkey, ham, roast beef, corned beef or pastrami. Though not a triple-decker, it is layered thick with paper-thin sliced meat, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and creamy cole slaw ($5.75). It is too messy to eat on the go, so devour it sitting at one of the two cafe tables.The fresh mozzarella and roasted pepper sandwich, which is drizzled with balsamic vinegar, topped with lettuce and tomato and served on a crusty roll, is lighter ($5.95). The tuna salad with celery, carrots, onions and dried cranberries is a very popular choice ($6.20 a pound or $5.45 a sandwich). Italian hoagies and hot Reuben sandwiches are also available. A cup of the soup of the day, especially when it is the spicy chicken gumbo, makes a good side ($3.15).Although Pete Andrich (for whom the sloppy Joe is named) has owned the store for only a few months, he plans to expand the menu. Breakfast sandwiches have recently been introduced, and paninis and wraps will soon be added. Local growers' goods will also be stocked here. Honey and chocolate are available, and the maple syrup comes from the farm behind the store. Penny candy will, thankfully, remain.Schooleys Mountain General Store, 250 Schooleys Mountain Road, Schooleys Mountain; (908) 852-4943.

And there are different products for accomplishing one or the other.''A whole-house ventilation system is not an exhaust fan for a house,'' said Gary Church-Smith, a technical service manager for the Energy Federation, a distributor of energy-efficient products in Natick, Mass. And an exhaust fan may not be a whole-house ventilation system.The difference between the two, Mr. Church-Smith said, is that while an exhaust system is used primarily to help cool the house, a whole-house ventilation system brings fresh air into tightly sealed and insulated homes.Steve Herzlieb, a project manager for Southface, a nonprofit research organization in Atlanta, said that a whole-house fan, which usually has 30-inch blades, is typically installed in a central location just below the attic. Such fans cost $150 to $350 (not including installation) and just pennies an hour to run.But they must be used properly. ''You have to make sure you open the windows before turning on the fan,'' Mr. Herzlieb said. Since a whole-house fan can move 4,000 cubic feet of air a minute, it will quickly depressurize a house and can cause back drafts in combustion appliances like gas water heaters. And since the air is exhausted into the attic, there must be adequate venting there to allow it to escape.Whole-house fans, Mr. Herzlieb said, should be used only when outdoor temperatures are lower than indoor temperatures; that usually means at night. And to avoid losing heat during the winter, the fan should be covered with an insulated cover on the attic side.An attic fan is another way to cool a house. ''An attic fan is anything that vents the attic,'' said Nick Strachan of ImprovementDirect.com in Chico, Calif. Such a fan, usually 12 to 18 inches in diameter and mounted in the roof or in a gable, removes heat from the attic, making it easier for the home's air-conditioning system to do its work.The most important thing when using an attic fan is to make sure that the attic is completely sealed from the living area. ''You don't want to have air-conditioned air being pulled up into the attic,'' Mr. Strachan said. Most attic fans, which range in price from $100 to $200 (not including installation), are thermostatically controlled and operate automatically.For homeowners who want to improve the exchange of air in their houses, there are four basic systems. Alex Wilson, president of BuildingGreen in Brattleboro, Vt., said an ''exhaust only'' system uses a fan and ductwork -- think of a bathroom exhaust fan -- to pump stale air out of the house and pull fresh air in.A ''supply'' system, he said, works the opposite way -- usually by using the home's existing forced-air system to pull fresh air in and distribute it through the house, thereby forcing stale air out through gaps.With a ''balanced'' system, Mr. Wilson said, fans and ductwork circulate air in and out of the house through installed exterior vents.An ''energy recovery system,'' Mr. Wilson said, works on the same principle, but is able to transfer heat from incoming or outgoing air, thereby ''recapturing'' much of the heat or air-conditioning lost to the outside.Victor Flynn of the Panasonic Home and Environment Company in Secaucus, N.J., said that for an average home, one or two of his company's WhisperComfort fans, which transfer heat from incoming or outgoing air to minimize energy loss, can exchange the air in the home about every three hours. Each fan costs about $600 without installation.YOUR HOME</text></article><article id="1835504"><summary>Sampling of housing on market in New York City metropolitan area; photos (M)</summary><text>Rowayton Beach House  $1,695,000CONNECTICUT: 7 Parkview RoadAn expanded 1930 colonial with four bedrooms, two and a half baths, custom built-ins in the living and family rooms with matching cabinetry in the kitchen, balconies off every bedroom and views of Long Island Sound.

The view can prompt quizzical reactions.Instead of honking cars and high-rises, what meets the eye is a decidedly un-Manhattan tableau of salt meadows and gurgling creeks, with wood-frame houses teetering on stilts over boat-lined docks.After a little while, the remote vibe gives way to a grid of streets and tidy tract homes, their yards decorated with corkscrew topiaries and statues of ducks and gnomes.The homey touches might make it hard to believe that Howard Beach's streets were the stage for two highly publicized incidents of white-on-black violence -- one in 1986, the inspiration for Spike Lee's 1989 race drama ''Do the Right Thing,'' and the other in 2005. These have given the neighborhood the reputation of being hostile to minority residents.Christine Gatchalian, who started looking in Howard Beach last year, said she had been sensitive to that reputation because she is white and her husband, Eric, is Asian.''Of course, they crossed my mind,'' she said of the attacks. ''But my friends who live here say those incidents were blown out of proportion, that we would be accepted.''It also helped, she said, that home prices can be 40 percent lower than in other Queens neighborhoods like Bayside, where she lived in an apartment before her move.In December, the Gatchalians bought a new semidetached home, with three bedrooms and two and a half baths, for $400,000. Each of their two children now has a bedroom.''We hadn't been looking for new construction,'' said Ms. Gatchalian, who works in Long Island City for a company that designs air-conditioning systems, ''but it ended up a big selling point.'' And given that the same size house in Bayside would have cost $650,000, ''the price was a definite plus,'' she said.Like the Gatchalians, many buyers have former Queens addresses but crave yards and water views, which Corona, Middle Village and Ozone Park have in short supply. At the same time, they're not willing to trade proximity to New York -- or relatively low property tax -- to live on Long Island.But the prices also draw buyers from down the street. In 2004, when he was still single, Robert Andresen paid $90,000 for a one-bedroom co-op in the neighborhood. Mr. Andresen, a custodial engineer for a school in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, says he completely renovated the place, selling it two years later for $172,000.Now Mr. Andresen is married; he and his wife, Tina, have a daughter. And he hopes to work similar magic with a detached raised ranch, with four bedrooms, three baths and 3,700 square feet, which cost $703,000 four months ago.Upgrading the bathrooms and other elements could increase the home's value to $1.2 million, he said.Still, it is the area's less quantifiable charms that really keep him there, like the wide streets on which he takes three-and-a-half-mile walks four evenings a week.''I will throw a football back and forth with the neighborhood kids while I'm walking,'' he said. ''It's like living in the country.''What You'll FindWith about two and a third square miles of land, Howard Beach is bounded by the airport, Jamaica Bay, the Brooklyn border and Conduit Avenue. It has four microneighborhoods: Hamilton Beach, Lindenwood, New Howard Beach and Old Howard Beach.The apartment that Mr. Andresen recently sold was in Lindenwood, between the Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue, filled with 1960s-era co-ops, condominiums and rentals.His move took him to New Howard Beach, which stretches west from Cross Bay Boulevard, the neighborhood's shopping strip, to 78th Street and East New York. Largely built on wetlands filled in the 1950's, New Howard Beach has housing to match the era: raised ranches, some attached, and Capes.Teardowns are increasingly common in New Howard Beach. The replacements are larger, with sandy-brick facades, tall arched entryways and Belgian block driveways in lieu of front lawns.To the east is Old Howard Beach, laid out from 102nd to 95th Streets in an early-20th-century development wave and filled with colonials, some zoned for more than one family.In the southeastern corner, and reached only by the 102nd Street Bridge, is quirky Hamilton Beach, where the Gatchalians live. Its single-story marshside bungalows began drawing middle-class Brooklynites about a century ago.Some still exist, their faded wooden walls hung with lobster pots, though recently, Stellar Development of nearby Great Neck has built 24 homes here, with about 10 more planned by year's end, in addition to new roads and sewers.The construction in Hamilton Beach has helped Howard Beach outpace the borough. From 2004 to 2006, the issuing of permits went up 43 percent in Community Board 10, which also encompasses South Ozone Park and parts of Ozone Park, versus about 5 percent in Queens as a whole, the city Building Department said.What You'll PayLocal agents say it is not uncommon to pay $600,000 for a home just to raze it, especially if it borders on Hawtree or Shelbank Basin, two canals dug in the early 1900s to give Old Howard Beach a Venetian flavor.After a sluggish 2006, new homes are selling for their million-dollar asking prices, especially in New Howard Beach, said Cecilia M. Calcagnile, an associate broker with Century 21 Amiable Realty Group II.Lower prices are found in noisier, higher-traffic areas, one of them along Shore Parkway. But aircraft landing nearby at Kennedy Airport have less of an effect on prices since the retirement of the ear-splitting Concorde in 2003, brokers say.Though it would tend to sell quickly, a buyer could pick up a single-family house with three bedrooms, one and a half baths and 1,300 square feet for $350,000, said Chad Michelini, an agent with Coldwell Banker Surf, who works in Oceanside, N.Y. ''Demand is strong, and the supply is limited here,'' he said, because the nearby Gateway National Recreation Area has protected status as a national park.Brokers say that about 30 percent of all residential units are rented, some to pilots and flight attendants, who commute via the AirTrain. They might pay $1,200 a month for a one-bedroom, one-bath, 800-square-foot apartment on the ground floor, according to Mr. Michelini.Houses can be cheaper in Nassau County, but taxes there are steep. The annual bill for a home in Merrick, for example, could be $13,000, brokers said; the same house in Howard Beach would probably be taxed at less than half that.What to DoPorgies, striped bass and blue crabs, not basic sustenance anymore, are still fished with passion; many residents own boats.Marinas like Captain Mike's, on Cross Bay Boulevard, are filled in the summer, and restaurants like Lenny's Clam Bar, with its magenta tablecloths and autographed celebrity photos, overlook the action, serving dishes like calamari marinara ($14.95). Italian seems to be the cuisine of choice in Howard Beach, where 46 percent of the residents claim Italian ancestry, according to the 2000 census.Along the Belt Parkway is a perhaps unexpected sight: people riding horses at Cedar Lane Stables (also home to the Federation of Black Cowboys, which teaches horsemanship to area youths).Lessons are available from Debra Singleton, whose store, Debbie's Reins &amp; Things, sells leather boots out of an old shipping container.''If you turn your back on the tall buildings,'' said Ms. Singleton, referring to distant skyscrapers, ''you would think you're back in time.''The SchoolsThe neighborhood has three public grade schools: Nos. 146, 232 and 207. The last, also known as the Rockwood Park School, teaches through Grade 8. Two Catholic schools -- Our Lady of Grace, on 101st Street, and Saint Helen School, on 157th Avenue -- also offer kindergarten through Grade 8.Public high school students attend John Adams High School in Ozone Park. French, Italian, Latin and Spanish are offered, as well as six Advanced Placement classes. In 2005, the graduation rate was 51 percent, versus 58 percent for the city. That year, the senior class scored 432 on the math part of the SAT and 408 on the verbal, compared with 511 math and 497 verbal statewide.The HistoryWilliam Howard, who owned a leather factory in Brooklyn in the 1880s, made footballs of the goats he grazed on land here, then remade the property as a resort.It once had a 2,000-foot-long pier and a Stanford White-designed clubhouse, according to Richard Ranft, neighborhood historian.There also used to be small bungalow communities like South Aqueduct, which was razed in the 1940s to make way for airport terminals.Yet the look of the past lives on in Ramblersville, a name used only by old-timers for the clutch of sagging homes between Coleman Square and Hamilton Beach. To reach them, head south by foot from Coleman Square's war memorials along the shoulder-width walkway squeezed between the railroad tracks and a creek, which bubbles over an old bicycle and car seat.The CommuteIn addition to the AirTrain, the transit hub includes a stop for the A train, which commuters can take to Lower Manhattan in 40 minutes.Buses are another option. The Q11, Q21, Q41, and Q53 thread through the neighborhood; the QM15 provides express bus service to Midtown.A number of residents, though, commute to Queens or Long Island by car, via Cross Bay Boulevard, which becomes Woodhaven Boulevard, or the Belt Parkway, across Howard Beach's northern edge.Going ForwardThe 2000 census tallied Howard Beach's population as 85 percent white, almost double that of Queens as a whole. But it has become more diverse in the past seven years, according to the area's councilman, Joseph Addabbo Jr., a Democrat.Howard Beach has had to overcome a ''lot of stereotypes in the press and media,'' he said, ''but it's still a great place to live.''Living In | Howard Beach, Queens</text></article><article id="1835551"><summary>Correction of March 18 article about multiethnic character of Bronx's Highbridge neighborhood (S)</summary><text>An article last Sunday about the multiethnic character of the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx misidentified the location of the Shady Moon Deli and Grocery, which is three blocks from the site of a fire on March 7 that killed 10 people.

''People who know about gardening say, 'Oh, my God, prairie grass?' ''A large Korean War memorial planned for this park in Flushing, the city's most heavily Korean neighborhood, has delighted veterans of that war and attracted significant support from Korean-American donors. But it has rankled the 200 members of the Kissena Park Civic Association, mostly longtime residents of this fiercely proud swath of eastern Flushing, where some who live in the single- and two-family Colonial and Tudor-style houses there can trace their Flushing ancestry to the 17th century.Members of the group, which Ms. McDermott is president of, fear that heavy machinery and diverted foot traffic in the 235-acre park will damage a grove of exotic trees, including a rare Manchurian linden, that constitute the last remnant of a once-famous nursery. And they predict that a planned 130-foot-long strip of dense, tufted prairie dropseed grass will attract litter and worse.''It's the kind of vegetation that encourages people to use it as a bathroom,'' Ms. McDermott said. ''They want to take up our grand entrance, off of our mall, with this weedy, miserable-looking stuff. That's like saying: 'Why don't we plant some crab grass in your yard? Wouldn't that be nice?' ''Even more annoying, Ms. McDermott said, is the fact that her group spent three years yanking patches of similar grass from another part of the park. ''We'd find all this garbage in it,'' she said.But John Liu, who represents the area on the City Council and has strongly backed the memorial, sees the group's claims as without merit.''That just doesn't make sense -- a grass that's more conducive to people or animals urinating,'' he said. ''I don't know of any grasses that have more of a diuretic effect than others.'' He conceded that tall grass could hide more litter, but said that the solution was regular maintenance, not a change of species.The memorial will consist of two bronze sculptures: a seven-foot statue of a soldier and, behind it, a 12-foot-high bronze foothill, recalling the mountainous terrain of Korea, descended by a file of soldiers carrying a comrade on a stretcher. About 40 percent of its $870,000 cost was donated by Korean-American groups and individuals.The city has only one major Korean War memorial, in Battery Park, although there is a modest marker on Cadman Plaza, in Brooklyn Heights. As a result, veterans of the war are glad to be getting a second major memorial.''Everyone's enthused that I've spoken to,'' said Andrew Musumeci, president of the Queens Korean War Veterans Association. ''People call it the 'forgotten war.' They say, 'Why did people in this country forget about us?' ''And what, Mr. Musumeci was asked, did he think about the prairie grass? ''Grass is grass,'' he said. ''I don't know.''ALEX MINDLINNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING</text></article><article id="1835564"><summary>Excerpts from previously published reviews of restaurants around Tompkins Square Park in East Village (Good Eating column) (S)</summary><text>Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, the site of rioting in 1988, has long been a quiet oasis for the affluent white-collar professionals who live in luxury condos nearby.

In fact, Con Edison already does this.My cooperative building, 322 Central Park West, participates in a real-time pricing program -- we purchase electricity at different prices during the day. We also participate in a curtailment program and receive payments to do so since curtailment is effectively the same as generation.Our building substantially reduced its electric demand at the same time as the Queens blackout last summer. Sufficient voluntary electric curtailment might have averted that blackout.It is less expensive for New Yorkers to reduce peak usage by voluntary curtailment and energy conservation than to have Con Edison upgrade electric lines and buy electricity from high-cost ''peaking'' plants.Ellen Funk  Upper West Side</text></article><article id="1835657"><summary>British real estate developer Howard Ronson dies at age 63; was one of most prolific builders of office space in Manhattan; photo (M)</summary><text>Howard P. Ronson, a British real estate developer who in the 1980s became one of the most prolific builders of office space in Manhattan, died Wednesday near his home in Monaco. He was 63.The cause was complications of cancer, said Larry Wyman, a principal in the HRO Group, where Mr. Ronson was chairman.The HRO Group is the parent company of HRO France and HRO International, the New York-based development firm that Mr. Ronson started in 1980.Mr. Ronson came to New York in 1979, when Manhattan's commercial real estate market was in a recession. Within three years, he had four major construction projects going at the same time.Since 1980, HRO International has built 12 office towers, with about 5.5 million square feet of space, in Manhattan. Among them are the 33-story Tower 56 on East 56th Street; 380 Madison Avenue, which is between 46th and 47th Streets and has 26 floors; and the 30-story Broad Financial Center on Whitehall Street.In 1981, excavation for one of the company's buildings, at 175 Water Street near the South Street Seaport, was halted by Mr. Ronson after the hull of a 92-foot merchant ship from the mid-1700s was unearthed. The bow was removed for restoration and sent to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va. A 30-story building now stands at 175 Water Street.At 32 Old Slip, Mr. Ronson's company built Financial Square, a 33-story building with a granite and silver-tinted glass facade. It had been the site of the United States Assay Office, where thousands of pounds of gold and silver were once stored and damaged paper money was incinerated.Howard Philip Ronson was born on May 28, 1943, the son of Anne and Gerald Ronson. His father was a homebuilder in England. Mr. Ronson is survived by his wife, the former Angelika Ivanc; two daughters, Gisele and Livia; a stepson, Stanley Shashoua of Manhattan; and a sister, Benita Refson, of London.After graduating from Carmel College in England, Mr. Ronson joined his father's homebuilding company in 1963. The company was at the center of a controversy in the late 1960s when large numbers of homebuyers complained about poor construction. An investigation by Britain's Department of Trade and Industry found ''gross mismanagement.''Mr. Ronson started his career in commercial development in 1968. In addition to the New York buildings, more than 40 construction projects, including office towers and shopping malls, have been completed by his companies in nine European cities.</text></article><article id="1835707"><summary>Correction of March 24 cabaret review of Marilyn Maye; review gave wrong phone number for Metropolitan Room</summary><text>A cabaret review yesterday of Marilyn Maye, who is singing tonight at 7:30 at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, misstated the club's telephone number.

One evening, our team faced a ruffian group led by Mr. Wepner and the local football star, George Stridio. As I was coming to the basket for an easy left-handed layup, Chuck used his elbow to uppercut me under the chin.Blood started gushing from my mouth and tongue. I missed the shot, and eventually our team lost the game. Afterward, Chuck's team just laughed and made some derogatory comments about our effort.Fast forward to about 10 years ago. My wife, Roz, and I were sitting in the lounge at La Guardia Airport waiting for a flight. A commotion behind us caught my attention. Behind me sat Muhammad Ali and his wife. I joined a long line of admirers waiting to get his autograph.When I finally got to shake his hand, I related my Wepner basketball story. I also told him that I was glad he beat the pants off him in March 1975.Mr. Ali must have felt some sympathy for my story. He got up, smiled and gave me a big hug.With this gesture, I finally got some small measure of revenge.Elliot J.

Sorry, but we're not buying it.We ''regular folks'' would like to live in a peaceful, quiet environment where we can still enjoy the things that make Long Island a great place to live -- open space, clean water and fresh air.We've watched the gobbling up of more and more of our open space. Enough is enough. We'd like to see alternative proposals that preserve our open space.JOHN ESPOSITO  HuntingtonTo the Editor:Development that addresses the needs for affordable middle-class housing, appropriate commercial space and preserved open, public spaces is critical to Long Island. But Charles B. Wang's plan for Plainview was clearly not that. Vince Polimeni bemoans that protesters ''quashed it altogether.''A cross-representation of the community came out to voice their concerns about a developer who was proposing high-end condominiums and rentals, a hotel, a conference center, retail spaces, office space and enclosed private land that would have benefited the few, not the many. The plan had just a handful of lowcost ''next generation'' housing and housing for the elderly.The people of Nassau County last November overwhelmingly approved a $100 million bond referendum to preserve open spaces. If Mr. Wang's plan had truly addressed the needs of the ''next generation,'' struggling elderly citizens and this commitment to preserved public open space, I believe there would have been a very different outcome.CAROLINE BOCK  Old Bethpage</text></article><article id="1835736"><summary>Deborah Murphy letter on March 4 article on dog parks in Suffolk County, NY</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Living the Good Life, Off the Leash'' (March 4):Dogs that are socialized and used to being around strangers and other dogs are less aggressive than dogs that are kept locked up in the backyard their entire lives and have little experience with other people and dogs. Dog parks benefit everyone by helping to nurture happy, welladjusted dogs to live among us.Coindre Hall Park is an open field of several acres where dogs and their owners have been coming for 30 years. It is a Suffolk County park, but there are no bathroom facilities or sidewalks, so other than to walk around an open, often muddy field,there is very little to do.You note that the county's parks commissioner wants to limit dogs to an enclosed dog park at the bottom of the hill.

Gilbride, a former chairman and chief executive of the Todd Shipyards Corporation, once the largest independent shipbuilding company in the country, died on March 17 at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 90.The cause was lung disease, his son Frank said.Mr. Gilbride, who started as a pipe fitter's helper at the Todd shipyard in Brooklyn when he was 14, was president of the company from 1958 to 1975, and its chairman and chief executive until his retirement in 1986.Founded by William H. Todd in 1916, the company built destroyers, cargo carriers and troop ships during both world wars. In World War II, it had 150,000 workers, most at its yard in Brooklyn. Well into the 1980s, more than 80 percent of the company's business was with the Navy. It also built and repaired commercial vessels: oil tankers, barges, container ships and ferries.By the time Mr. Gilbride retired, the company had six additional shipyards, in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Houston and Galveston, Tex. It had revenue of $507 million in 1985. A scarcity of government contracts soon began taking its toll. The company, now called the Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation, has one yard, in Seattle, and had sales of $202 million last year.John Thomas Gilbride was born in Brooklyn on May 29, 1916, a son of Francis J. and Mary Figuera Gilbride. His father was president of the Robbins Dry Dock and Repair Company in Brooklyn, which was later acquired by the Todd company. Mr. Gilbride graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1938.Besides his son Frank, of Greenwich, Conn., he is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Rosemary Shelare; two other sons, Gary of Old Greenwich, Conn., and John Jr. of Media, Pa., who was president of the Todd company from 1986 to 1989; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</text></article><article id="1835822"><summary>Defense Dept confirms deaths of four service members in Iraq (S)&#65533;</summary><text>The Department of Defense has identified 3,227 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war.

But while Gov. Eliot Spitzer was at a stalemate with state Republicans, he appeared to have resolved the biggest point of contention with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.The mayor had objected to the governor's move to cut $328 million in unrestricted annual aid to the city. Mr. Spitzer, in conversations with the mayor last week, agreed to restore a small amount of the money in the coming fiscal year, on the order of $20 million, and in the ensuing years to restore most, if not all, of the funding, the person said. Both houses of the Legislature had already proposed a similar restoration of some of the governor's cuts.The agreement might account for the mayor's effusiveness in praising the governor's budget in a radio interview Friday, particularly his controversial plan to overhaul state Medicaid spending, which Senate Republicans have opposed.Over all, budget negotiations remain deadlocked in Albany, chiefly over Mr. Spitzer's proposal to reduce the proportion of education aid sent to Long Island as part of his plan to send more to needy districts. Given the complexity of the budget and the legal requirement that it be printed three days before legislators vote on it, chances are slim that it will be passed by the state's deadline of April 1, which is Sunday.Mr. Spitzer has said he prefers a good budget to a timely one, but he has not said whether he would put in place a temporary budget, as his predecessor did when budgets were late, or move to shut down parts of the government.''Talks throughout the weekend have yielded some progress,'' said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor, without elaborating. ''We remain hopeful about an on-time budget, so any talk of a shutdown is premature.''THE EMPIRE ZONE</text></article><article id="1835911"><summary>PATH train bound for Manhattan derails after leaving Hoboken, NJ, stranding about 300 passengers for roughly two hours (S)</summary><text>A PATH train bound for the 33rd Street station in Manhattan derailed at 2:55 p.m. yesterday after leaving Hoboken, stranding about 300 passengers for roughly two hours, the authorities said. Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the PATH system, said there were no injuries. After another PATH train was dispatched alongside the derailed train, he said, the passengers were transferred and taken to Hoboken, where they arrived at 4:15 p.m. He said one set of wheels on one of the train's middle cars had left the tracks, for reasons that remained unclear. Direct service from Hoboken to Manhattan had not resumed late yesterday, and Mr. DiFulco said it was unclear whether it would be restored for commuters this morning. But he said PATH riders could travel from Hoboken to the Pavonia station in Jersey City and then to 33rd Street in Manhattan.THOMAS J. LUECK</text></article><article id="1835949"><summary>Honor Moore reviews Lee Thuna play Fugue, directed by Judith Ivey; Liam Craig, Rick Stear and Deirdre O'Connell star; photo (M)</summary><text>Found wandering the streets of Chicago, her feet bruised and bloody, a homeless woman whom the doctors call ''Mary Smith'' suffers from dissociative amnesia, also called ''fugue amnesia.'' She has lost her memory and sense of identity. A supervising psychiatrist (Liam Craig) asks a younger doctor (Rick Stear), who has his own demons, to work with Mary (Deirdre O'Connell) to retrieve her memory.The process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey, at the Cherry Lane Theater.Repressed memory and family secrets have provided the wellspring for some of the most haunting works in the American theatrical canon: In ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' and ''Death of a Salesman,'' for instance, characters fight off force fields of the past like Jacob battling the angel.Ms. Thuna takes a comic approach to her material, but Mary, as written, seems simply a character who plays her trauma for laughs, whose memory is strangely compliant, and whose resistance feels like the stubbornness of a pouting child. A warm and pretty woman, she is a soft touch for her interlocutor, and once she gets going, her past plays itself out with ease and in such detail that we almost forget that her recollections are leading to a tragic revelation.First produced at the Long Wharf Theater in 1986, ''Fugue'' was written before contemporary thinking about recovered memory and trauma, and perhaps for that reason it seems dated. The action unfolds with the inevitability of the Bach fugue played at intermission, but without its dissonance or verve. Elements like Mary's mentally ill father, her illegitimate daughter, the wealth of Mary's lover and the working-class origins of the investigating psychiatrist never become integral to the action.Ms. Ivey does the best she can with lighting and clever staging to lend Mary's journey the theatrical strangeness a memory play requires, but she cannot overcome the sitcom banality of the script.''Fugue'' plays through April 21 at Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village; (212) 239-6200.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1835984"><summary>Friends, family and colleagues gather at Symphony Space in Manhattan to honor late theater critic Richard Gilman (M)</summary><text>What kind of write-up would the drama and literary critic Richard Gilman have given to his own memorial service at Symphony Space in Manhattan yesterday?''I think it would be a favorable review, with an edge,'' said the critic Stanley Kauffmann, speaking to a crowd of more than 100 of Mr. Gilman's former students and colleagues, many from his days at Yale School of Drama. The verdict: ''Not great, but good,'' Mr. Kauffmann said, channeling Mr. Gilman.Mr. Gilman, a critic, a father, a professor, a writer and a thinker, died Oct. 28 at 83.''I see him now as I'm not quite certain he saw himself,'' the theater critic Gordon Rogoff said. ''A delirious romantic, constantly falling in love with literature, plays, performers, paintings, football players, poker and finally with Yasuko, the wonderful interpreter given to him when he was visiting Japan for the first time.''And to his Yale students, Mr. Gilman was also ''the cool professor,'' in the words of the actor and comedian David Alan Grier, and the voice that still informs their writing today.''Dick lives in the playwrights we became,'' said the playwright David Epstein, who took a writing class with Mr. Gilman, and still remembers walking with him down New Haven's Chapel Street, en route to a favorite Chinese restaurant. ''We all thought it was the best Chinese food anywhere, but it was probably the best company. Being 23 and hanging out with Dick was as good as spring rolls could get.''After the service Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, said, ''For those of us taught by him, he was our intellectual conscience.''''He was a very funny guy,'' he said, ''but there was a fundamental seriousness about Dick that kept us on our toes.''Mr. Gilman's son, Nicholas, spoke of his father's sense of humor and his love of Groucho Marx; and one of his daughters, Priscilla, remembered how her father would address her worries in the voice of his ''Sesame Street'' alter ego, Super Grover.A slide show, accompanied by Bach's Suite in G major, also captured the full range of Mr. Gilman's life and loves -- Mr. Gilman in a black-and-white photograph as a young boy, Mr. Gilman smiling with a dog, Mr. Gilman leaning back in front of a typewriter, Mr. Gilman on the ground with his children, Mr. Gilman in front of shelves of books, and Mr. Gilman with his third wife, Yasuko Shiojiri.''Thank you for missing him,'' Ms. Shiojiri said, addressing the crowd.

And a private airport terminal just for first-class and top elite-status passengers.Last week, I flew on a double-deck Airbus A380, operated jointly by Airbus and Lufthansa, making a demonstration overseas trip, its first with a full passenger load, from Frankfurt to New York. There were about 500 people on board, but the huge A380 is actually certified to carry as many as 853 passengers and another two dozen crew members, in all-coach configurations.On the other hand, it can be used to carry a lot fewer people. Airbus, which has 156 commercial orders for the plane, says it also has one letter of intent from a very rich, anonymous individual who wants a private A380 as soon as one becomes available. The airplane is about two years behind schedule for delivery to its existing customers and the first one won't go into regular service until late this year. More private orders are expected.Not long ago, I wrote an article about how some very rich people were unable to make do with standard corporate aircraft, even top-of-the-line Boeing business jets or Airbus corporate jets, which cost as much as $60 million fully outfitted. So they've been converting big airliners like 767s, 777s and even 747s into private planes.Naturally, the A380 is now at the top of the must-have list, said Aage D&#252;nhaupt, a spokesman for Lufthansa Technik, a Lufthansa subsidiary that specializes in the maintenance and overhaul of airliners.We talked in a lounge on the upper deck of the A380 en route to New York from Germany. The A380 was on a trip intended to put in-flight services and systems through a dress rehearsal and to show off the plane in the United States.Who in the world would buy an A380 for private or business use? Well, they are already in big planes. ''At the moment, there are about 20 individuals who are privately flying 747s,'' Mr. D&#252;nhaupt said. Lufthansa Technik converted 12 of those 747s to private use.An A380 costs about $310 million, without basics like seats and bulkheads. Figure on another $100 million for those necessities amid a true luxury interior, he said.''I'm not expecting that a Fortune 500 company will be standing up and saying, now we need an A380,'' he acknowledged. ''It is hard to explain how to use it for business purposes, that's for sure.''Of course, some people don't have to explain anything. Lufthansa Technik is among the aircraft-conversion specialists now actively marketing the A380 as a personal and/or business jet to that market, which is chiefly in the Middle East, he said.A slick brochure describes the A380 V.I.P. as ''simply the ultimate aircraft'' for private travel. The floor plans look like that of a cruise ship, with a lounge the size of a hotel lobby and a master bedroom that looks like a five-star hotel suite.''When you look at our interior design, you will also see very large conference areas that can hold 20 to 30 people,'' Mr. D&#252;nhaupt said. ''So if you have to travel with 50 people all the time, and have meetings in the air, maybe then it makes sense as a business aircraft.''The sky may be the limit, but physics and aerodynamics do still apply. ''It's not possible to have a big Jacuzzi or a swimming pool on board even if you can afford this,'' he said.Private bathrooms with showers, by the way, are already standard in most big business and personal aircraft, known as V.I.P. aircraft, which start with the Boeing business jet and Airbus corporate jet. Lufthansa Technik has outfitted more than 60 V.I.P. aircraft, he said, adding: ''From our experience, 95 percent have a shower.''For those who are not flying private but still want to avoid the rest of us in the airport, there's another option. At Frankfurt Airport, Lufthansa has an elegant private terminal for first-class passengers and members of its Hon Circle top-status frequent-flier program, which requires flying 600,000 miles every two years.It has a restaurant, a cigar lounge, private bathrooms with showers and tubs, and a bar ''with 84 different whiskeys,'' said Gudrun Opper, a Lufthansa employee who showed reporters around the place.Drop your rental car at the door. You check bags, clear customs and even board right from the private terminal, where a fleet of limousines waits to whisk you directly to the plane.A car drives you across the apron right up to the plane, where a valet escorts you up the stairs and aboard.''You don't even see the airport,'' said Ms. Opper, really getting my attention with that prospect.ON THE ROAD</text></article><article id="1836018"><summary>Alertness Solu&#65533;</summary><text>Business travel is a lot like space travel. I should know. I used to direct the fatigue countermeasures program at NASA, where we studied the effects of space travel on astronauts. And as an independent scientist, I am constantly traveling on business, so I see how frequent fliers handle exhaustion.The fatigue you experience is pretty much the same, whether you are on the Delta shuttle or the space shuttle. You are losing sleep and your body clock is being disrupted. Frequent travelers make things worse by doing nothing about their jet lag, or drinking too much, or taking herbal supplements that don't work.One of the worst things they do is not taking the vacation days they deserve. I just completed a study for Air New Zealand that suggests that if people actually took their allotted vacation time, they could improve their performance by more than 80 percent. When you add it all up, a business trip can be far more exhausting than your average space mission.No business traveler reacts to exhaustion in exactly the same way. For example, when I am extremely fatigued, everything slows down. I flew from San Francisco to Stockholm a few years ago for a conference on sleep research. I was awake for 22 hours, and when we landed, everything seemed to move slower. The cabin door took forever to open, the people shuffled off the plane at a snail's pace, and I even seemed to move in slow motion.''Where are we meeting?'' I asked a conference representative greeting us at the airport.Her lips moved, but the sounds didn't match. ''Neeext to the luuuuuugage caaaarousel,'' she said. That's when I knew that I was overtired and needed to sleep immediately.With business travelers, you see two kinds of behavior when they are overtired. They either become withdrawn or cranky. When they are cranky, that's when bad things happen.On a flight from San Francisco to London, I recently watched two grown men who were obviously sleep-deprived silently fighting over an armrest. One of the passengers would shift his arm and then the other would quickly move into place to claim the space. Finally, they both fell asleep, and their arms went slack, leaving the armrests vacant.But here's the strange thing: It happened in business class, where there is ample armrest space for everyone.The most extreme example of sleep deprivation I've ever encountered happened to me years ago, when a TV reporter in San Francisco asked me to monitor her experiment to stay awake for three full days.On the third day, we were walking around the Stanford University campus after dark, and we stopped at the bookstore.''Look at the hula dancers!'' she said, jabbing at the static display of books in the window. She was obviously hallucinating.A few minutes later, a U.F.O. landed in White Plaza. The reporter smiled and asked if I wanted to go for a ride. ''Go on,'' she said, pointing at imaginary stairs leading into the belly of the spacecraft. ''You first.''''Oh, no!'' I replied, looking at the dark void in the middle of the square. ''After you.''FREQUENT FLIER E-mail: elliott@nytimes.com</text></article><article id="1836020"><summary>Swiss mining ci</summary><text>Xstrata, the Swiss mining company, moved to extend its presence in the nickel market Monday with a friendly takeover of LionOre Mining International valued at 4.6 billion Canadian dollars ($3.96 billion).Ted C. Mayers, chief financial officer of LionOre, said that the company accepted Xstrata's bid of 18.50 Canadian dollars a share, a 5.8 percent premium over Friday's closing price of 17.49 Canadian dollars, largely because nickel prices, which have roughly doubled over the last year, are now ''unsustainable.''Any further increases in nickel prices, added Colin H. Steyn, the president and chief executive, will ''cause value destruction in the stainless steel industry, which will affect demand.'' Nickel is a crucial ingredient of rust-resistant steel.Although both companies played down the prospect of a third party's upsetting their arrangement with another bid, some investors clearly thought otherwise. By midday, shares of LionOre, which is based in Toronto, had risen above the value of Xstrata's all-cash offer.While the Xstrata bid is modest in terms of current market prices, it is about 275 percent of the LionOre share price a year ago.Xstrata became a big player in the nickel industry last year when it purchased Falconbridge, another mining company based in Toronto, for 24.8 billion Canadian dollars. On Monday, Ian Pearce, the chief executive of Xstrata Nickel, said that adding LionOre's mines in Botswana, South Africa and Australia ''will position Xstrata Nickel as a truly global business.''The merger requires approval by two-thirds of LionOre's shareholders. Although two private investors expressed dismay at the value of the offer during a conference call, Xstrata said its bid had already been accepted by shareholders, including directors, who own about 19 percent of LionOre's stock. Analysts were also generally positive about the offer.Mr. Steyn said that several other companies reviewed LionOre's books but that he did not expect any of them to bid.LionOre was a small player in a series of conflicting bids for Canadian nickel mining companies that culminated in Xstrata's acquisition of Falconbridge and the purchase of Falconbridge's larger rival, Inco, by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil last year.When Inco was trying to acquire Falconbridge, the action that first set the two companies in play, LionOre agreed to buy a Falconbridge nickel refinery in Norway to allay antitrust concerns. While the failure of Inco's bid meant that the deal was not completed, Mr. Steyn said it led indirectly to the bid from Xstrata.</text></article><article id="1836038"><summary>Ex-President of CBS Radio Is Returning To Le</summary><text>CBS said yesterday that it would bring back the former president of its radio division, Dan Mason, to succeed Joel Hollander as head of the 144-station group.Mr. Mason will become president and chief executive on April 16.Mr. Mason left CBS Radio in 2002. Since then, he has served as a consultant and adviser for a variety of radio clients, including CBS.In 1995, he became president of CBS Radio, which merged with Infinity Broadcasting in 1997 and took the Infinity name. Part of his mandate was to integrate the original CBS stations with those owned by Group W, American Radio Systems and others.Mr. Hollander, who did not return phone calls seeking comment, is said to have been unhappy with the leadership of CBS's chief executive, Leslie Moonves.The station group, like others in the industry, has been struggling, leaving CBS leadership unhappy. Last year, CBS sold 39 of the company's stations for $668 million.The industry is under pressure from advertisers who are diversifying their spending into other media, and is losing listeners to a broad array of other media, including the Internet and digital music players.CBS Radio's problems have been particularly pronounced. When Howard Stern was preparing to take his talk show to Sirius Satellite Radio, following his former boss, Mel Karmazin, Mr. Hollander argued that the show should be immediately taken off CBS, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation.Mr. Moonves, however, believed it was better to keep Mr. Stern on CBS Radio as long as CBS retained the rights to the show.Eventually that arrangement fell apart, and CBS sued Mr. Stern for promoting his move to Sirius on his morning show on CBS. The two sides settled last spring.Despite last year's station sales, Mr. Mason said in a telephone interview that there was no push to sell more stations.''To grow our business, it is a combination of two things: executing for our listener and to explore all the new things that high-definition radio will bring,'' he said, using one term for digital broadcast radio.</text></article><article id="1836050"><summary>Correction of Mar 19 editorial regarding cost of one development bill cited</summary><text>An editorial on March 19 stated incorrectly that the House version of the 2007 Water Resources and Development bill would cost $40 billion.

Bertelsmann provided Napster with $85 million in loans starting in late 2000.In lawsuits filed in 2003, EMI, the Universal Music Group and several independent publishers accused Bertelsmann of contributing to copyright infringement by aiding Napster, which enabled millions of users to trade pirated songs. Napster has since been reborn as a legal subscription service.Late last year, Bertelsmann agreed to pay the Universal Music Group, the world's biggest music corporation, $60 million to settle that company's portion of the lawsuit. The deal came as part of Universal's pact to buy Bertelsmann's music publishing unit for $2 billion.Separately, a San Francisco venture capital firm that also invested in Napster negotiated a settlement with Universal and EMI in December.The latest settlement comes days before Bertelsmann is to appear in court to argue a crucial motion in the case. The company still faces the remaining plaintiffs in the suit, namely smaller music publishers who own or administer song copyrights.Bertelsmann has a separate agreement with the Warner Music Group, which is not a plaintiff but maintains the right to sue in the future, according to people briefed on the arrangement who requested anonymity because they did not have permission to disclose it.But the deal between EMI and Bertelsmann represents a resolution of a bitter chapter for the music industry, which has long sought redress for the havoc unleashed by Napster in 1999 and later by its more sophisticated successors. Since swapping music files online turned into a mass phenomenon, sales of recorded music have plunged. While the industry has won a series of legal victories, it has been unable to reverse the slide, which it attributes largely to continuing piracy.Suing Bertelsmann had appeared to represent the industry's best chance to recover significant damages.Eric Nicoli, chief of EMI, said yesterday that, with the case resolved, EMI could ''continue to pursue the development of new legitimate digital music business models.''</text></article><article id="1836119"><summary>Detective Michael Seward of Brooklyn is arrested and charged with raping his companion in Manhattan after couple had dispute (S)</summary><text>A detective was arrested yesterday and charged with raping his companion, the police said.

But you suspect that he would have admired the filmmakers' gall.Based on a 2001 production by the South African performing arts company Dimpho Di Kopane and winner of the top award at the 2005 Berlin Film Festival, ''U-Carmen'' pushes against every expectation you would normally bring to a movie version of Bizet's opera. It relocates the tale's doomed romantic triangle to Khayelitsha, an industrial community near Cape Town; sets the action in and around a cigarette factory; and translates its libretto into Xhosa, a regional language distinguished by its abundance of pops and clicks.And it fills its main roles not with international movie stars, but mostly with local theater and opera performers, many new to films.The South African singer Pauline Malefane plays Carmen, who's been changed from a Gypsy into a cigarette roller and a member of her workplace choir. (Ms. Malefane also helped translate the libretto.) Carmen's chief suitor, Don Jos&#233;, is now Jongikhaya (Andile Tshoni), a Bible-reading cop who lets the beguiling but rough-edged Carmen lure him into a smuggling operation. Escamillo, the toreador with whom Carmen becomes infatuated, has been changed to Nomakhaya (Lungelwa Blou), an expatriate tenor who's the son of a slain anti-apartheid activist. The bullfight has become the off-screen butchering of a cow.From the leads on down, the film is adequately sung but brilliantly acted. Some of the anti-glitzy choices (notably the decision to cast two leads with actors who aren't svelte, then insisting upon their sexiness) add to the film's neo-realist grit.The director, Mark Dornford-May, and the conductor, Charles Hazlewood, deny audiences the grandness associated with musicals and operas. Although ''U-Carmen'' starts with poetic close-ups of unidentified blood-red tatters flapping in the wind, the film largely eschews stylized sets and glossy photography, borrowing instead from kitchen sink dramas and documentaries. There are exceptions to this strategy. The film's version of the opera's fortunetelling-with-cards scene, for instance, is replaced with an indigenous ceremony involving a mirror; the camera glides around the seer's room in a semicircle, gradually revealing Carmen's frozen reflection.But for the most part, the film's action is intentionally plain, always acknowledging its physical environment. During the final confrontation at the company's theater, when Carmen and Jongi sing in a metal stairwell, their voices echo hollowly.The approach has its downside. Bizet's score, which has been cut but not otherwise mangled, is so emotional that you often wish that the images would rise to match it rather than stay earthbound. At times it seems that the filmmakers aren't just rooting the movie in reality (an already curious ambition for an opera) but trying to see how much dirt they can throw on their source without obliterating its allure.Mr. Hazlewood's strategy also draws attention to the lack of psychological detail in the central love triangle, which isn't good.But the music still pierces, the blood still flows, and the overall conception is so original that even when the movie falters in the moment, it dazzles in the memory.U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Mark Dornford-May; written (in Xhosa, with English subtitles) by Mr. Dornford-May, Andiswa Kedama and Pauline Malefane, based on the opera ''Carmen,'' by Georges Bizet; director of photography, Giulio Biccari; edited by Ronelle Loots; music by Bizet, conducted by Charles Hazlewood; choreographer, Joel Mthethwa; art director, Craig Smith; produced by Mr. Dornford-May, Ross Garland and Camilla Driver; released by Koch Lorber Films.

A program note for her new piece, ''The Exiles,'' asks us to think of Helen, whose kidnapping ignited the war, as ''probably the first weapon of mass destruction.'' But the play is less about her than about what happens when war comes home.Last year's ''Trilogy,'' which like this play used video, different sorts of puppets, actors and live music, began with Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia to ensure fair winds for his warships bound for Troy. His wife, Clytemnestra, never forgave him. ''Trilogy'' took up not only Iphigenia's personal tragedy but also the seductions of battle, staged in an unforgettable display of shadow puppetry.As ''The Exiles'' begins, Orestes sleeps with his sister, Electra, at his side. It is 15 years after their father, Agamemnon, made his triumphant return from war and their mother, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus, her lover, murdered him and condemned Orestes to death. Now, years later, commanded by Apollo, Orestes has avenged his father by killing Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. The action of this one-hour play is Orestes' struggle with his guilt. Is he responsible for his mother's death, or are the gods?''The Exiles'' feels incomplete. The life-size puppets with their impassive faces, manipulated by actors in dark clothing, give us Orestes and Electra driven by forces beyond their power, but missing are moments in which the characters stand, as Iphigenia did in ''Trilogy,'' human and unmasked. Without such a revelation, ''The Exiles'' falls short of the heart-rending cruelty for which we turn to Greek tragedy.Still, ''The Exiles'' ends with a coup de th&#233;&#226;tre that reminds us of Ms. Skipitares's mastery: the sudden appearance of Apollo as a gigantic, bespectacled gold-lam&#233;-clad puppet that to me bore a strange resemblence to Donald H. Rumsfeld. In Greek tragedy the deus ex machina reassures us that there is divine logic to even the most horrific events, but here, like Orestes, we are left bewildered and uncertain.''The Exiles'' continues through April 8 at La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org.THEATER REVIEW</text></article><article id="1836165"><summary>Matt Zoller Seitz reviews Jethro Senger documentary film Headspace...: The Sound of Life... (M)</summary><text>If you're looking for a documentary about the electronic music scene filled with historical lectures, performance clips and talking heads, ''Headspace  The Sound of Life '' isn't for you and doesn't try to be.Unlike previous documentaries about the topic, this feature by Jethro Senger tries to capture the essence of the music and the lifestyle associated with it. It's experimental rather than expository, bargain-basement visionary work that deploys evocative filmmaking devices (slow dissolves, frame blurs, slow and fast motion, strobe-flash effects) to induce a 3-a.m.-on-the-dance-floor mindset, a feeling that time is suspended and that the only thing that matters is the beat (described by one interview subject as ''fat kick always -- boom, boom'').Here and there, Mr. Senger throws a factual tidbit our way, pointing out, for instance, that the repetitive, trancelike rhythms of techno reflect a blurring of international boundaries and the sounds of urban and industrial life. But mostly the film avoids academic trappings, which means that it will be catnip to devotees but impenetrable to outsiders.There's no narrator, no recurring timeline and surprisingly few on-screen ID tags telling you who's speaking at any given moment. ''Headspace'' is more interested in the patterns made by downcast laser beams cutting through smoky air.FILM REVIEW</text></article><article id="1836179"><summary>Axel G Rosin, former president of Book-of-the-Month Club and later head of Scherman Foundation, dies at age 99; photo (M)</summary><text>Axel G. Rosin, a former president of the Book-of-the-Month Club and later the head of the Scherman Foundation, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 99.The death was confirmed by his daughter Karen Sollins.Mr. Rosin (pronounced Rose-EEN) was president of the Book-of-the-Month Club from 1960 to 1973, and chairman until his retirement in 1979. The club was designed to allow millions of readers to receive in the mail recent books chosen by a panel of prominent judges.Mr. Rosin's father-in-law, Harry Scherman, started the company in 1926 with the idea that even people living in remote areas with no access to bookstores or libraries could line their shelves with the latest, best books, at reduced prices. Under Mr. Rosin's leadership, membership reached 1.25 million and annual sales doubled to $65 million.In 2000, the club became part of Bookspan, jointly owned by Time Warner and Bertelsmann AG; Bookspan operates 40 book clubs with almost 8 million members. Book-of-the-Month Club selections were made by its editors, without the recommendations of independent judges, beginning in 1994; the judges were brought back in 2001, then canceled again in 2004 as a cost-saving move.Mr. Rosin was also chairman emeritus of the Scherman Foundation, founded by Harry Scherman in 1940, which has made grants totaling more than $100 million to organizations that promote the arts, social welfare programs, disarmament, reproductive rights, social justice and the environment.Axel Gerhardt Rosin was born in Berlin on Dec. 11, 1907. He graduated from university in Berlin in 1930 with a law degree. In 1934, after working as a lawyer for the Supreme Court of Prussia, he emigrated to the United States because the Nazis had decreed that Jews could no longer enter courthouses.Mr. Rosin worked for several years as an officer of a shoe factory in Luray, Va. In 1943, he married Katharine Scherman and two years later became comptroller of the family company.In addition to his wife, who is the author of several books, and his daughter Karen, of Cambridge, Mass., who is now chairwoman of the Scherman Foundation, he is survived by another daughter, Susanna Bergtold of Leonia, N.J., and two grandchildren.</text></article><article id="1836180"><summary>Photo of bubbles blown at event in Union Square Park intended to bring people together</summary><text>Bubble Bath, a public bubble-blowing event intended to bring people together, filled the airin Union Square Park with shimmering iridescence on the first Saturday of spring.

Children impatient to inherit their parents' estates, wives eager to lose their elderly husbands, found arsenic a terrific way to speed their hopes along. Thanks in large part to improved detection techniques, however, murder by poison has become quite rare: the Georgia woman who was convicted last week, for the second time, of killing a husband by lacing his meals with antifreeze is very much the exception.Still, it was no surprise that as soon as the recent dog and cat deaths in North America were traced to a rat poison in pet food, the question of sabotage arose immediately: ''Was Pet Food Deliberately Poisoned?'' read the headline in one Canadian newspaper.Whenever deaths involve chemical causes, people immediately speculate about a shadowy poisoner at work. The drug overdose of Anna Nicole Smith is only the latest to make headlines, along with the efforts by the family of Harry Houdini to exhume his body to answer persistent rumors that the magician was fatally poisoned by rivals in 1926. (This last episode seems particularly quixotic, as it is far easier to identify a poison than a poisoner; we may safely assume that finding poison in Houdini's body will not suddenly reveal the name of a long-hidden murderer.)And while the investigation into the pet food poisonings so far discounts murderous intent, it's obvious from Internet chat room discussions that many people don't accept the innocent explanation. One particularly vengeful cat owner posted a recommendation that the ''nutcase'' in question be fed a large, and presumably lethal, meal of ''Special Kitty'' brand cat food.Much as I appreciate an appropriate punishment -- and the fascination of an elusive pet-hating psychopath -- I suspect that blaming a lone killer is far too easy an answer. Instead, this latest encounter with contaminated food leads to a more complicated, and less comfortable, sense of the poisoners among us.According to scientists at Cornell University, the cause of the pet deaths -- fewer than 20 have been formally reported, although more than 1,000 have been self-reported on the Internet -- was lethal levels of aminopterin in the food.Aminopterin is an enzyme inhibitor; it blocks normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. It's able to interfere with genetic processes, reproductive abilities and metabolic functions, making it useful in a limited way, and dangerous in a complete one. In the United States, aminopterin is licensed only for medical research like cancer treatment. In China and other Asian countries, it has been used as a rat poison, usually to keep stored grain from becoming infested.As it turns out, the producer of the tainted products, Menu Foods, recently switched to a Chinese supplier of wheat gluten, which is used to thicken gravy-style pet food. It's too early to know for certain, but it seems very likely that tainted gluten slipped past quality inspections because aminopterin is not included in routine toxicity screens. Investigators also emphasize that the poisoned food came from two manufacturing plants, separated by a good thousand miles, which would require an extremely energetic saboteur.Does that rule out the possibility of a deliberate poisoning? No. But I worry that the conspiracy theorists, those who persist in believing that poor, sad Anna Nicole Smith was murdered or that a crazy animal hater is automatically responsible for tainted food, divert us from the probable cause and the more serious issue. Pesticide contamination, not just in China but globally, occurs because we operate, deliberately, in a world of poisons.We kill lots of animals -- the ones we find annoying, destructive or unsafe. We regularly employ toxic substances against rats, insects, prairie dogs, coyotes and invasive fish, and yet we are shocked when those same lethal substances affect us.We've been learning and forgetting this lesson almost since we began using industrial pesticides: in 1959, American consumers spun into panic upon learning that their Thanksgiving cranberries were contaminated with the weed killer aminotriazole; in 1962, Rachel Carson published her expos&#233; on the wildlife deaths caused by the pesticide DDT; in 1984, consumers nationwide threw away their pancake mixes after learning they contained trace levels of a grain fumigant; in 1989, consumers were horrified after the pesticide Alar was discovered on apples in grocery stores.While cases of acute toxicity are rare, accumulated research studies show that chronic pesticide exposure, not surprisingly, is less than healthy. In 2003, for instance, a federal study reported that a high level of exposure to agricultural pesticides raised the risks of some birth defects by 65 percent and increased the likelihood of a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to Parkinson's. Suburban lawn chemicals have been associated with increased cancer risks in both people and domestic pets.So I don't think we have to look too far for the poisoners in this round of pet deaths. We lean toward the saboteur and the murderous poisoner because they've always lived among us, and because they make excellent scapegoats. But we're all poisoners in our way -- purchasers of roach sprays, consumers of perfect produce delivered by grace of dangerous chemicals. Every so often, we are forced to realize that, like the arsenic poisoners of old, our lifestyle also demands innocent victims.Op-Ed Contributor Deborah Blum, a professor of science journalism at the University of Wisconsin, is writing a book about poison murders of the early 20th century.</text></article><article id="1836185"><summary>Stanley Fish Op-Ed column on choosing mystery to buy at airport bookstore; advises reading first sentence (S)</summary><text>You're at the mystery section of an airport bookstore and the loudspeaker has just announced that your flight is in the late stages of boarding. You have maybe three or four minutes to make a choice. (That is your assignment, if you choose to accept it.) How do you go about deciding?Look at the back cover? No, back-cover copy is written by an advertising flack who probably hasn't read the book and is trying for something short and punchy like (and I will be making none of this up) ''As unpredictable as trade winds'' or ''It couldn't get any worse. Until it does.'' Besides, rarely will the style of back-cover prose be anything like the style of the book itself, so reading it won't tell you what you want to know. Depending on your taste, it might tell you something usefully negative. The moment I spot a reference to any country but this one, I move on. No international settings for me. Ditto for any promise that the book I am holding will be funny. Funny is for sitcoms and stand-up comedians. When it comes to mysteries, I'm a Matthew Arnold guy, all for high seriousness.How about the blurbs, especially if a few of your favorites are touting the merits of an author new to you? I used to take direction from blurbs until I told a very famous mystery writer that he was right to have praised a book I had bought on his authority. He replied that he didn't remember it, probably hadn't read it, and was no doubt doing a favor for his publisher. Members of that club, it seems, pass blurbs out to each other like party favors.The only thing left -- and this is sure-fire -- is to read the first sentence. The really bad ones leap out at you. Here's one that has the advantage of being short (you can close the book quickly): ''He cut through the morning rush-hour crowd like a shark fin through water.'' Enough said. Here's one that begins O.K., except for the heroine's name, but then goes on a beat and a half too long: ''Brianne Parker didn't look like a bank robber or a murderer -- her pleasantly plump baby face fooled everyone.'' You don't need the stuff after the dash. Brianne's not looking like a murderer is the hook that draws you in to find out why she is one. The ''pleasantly plump baby face'' bit lets you off the hook and dumps you on a clich&#233;, which might be all right if the author gave any sign of knowing that it was one. This guy is going to hit false notes for 300 pages, but I won't be listening.Sometimes a first sentence is bad because it's pretentious. ''Some stories wait to be told.'' That's an opening Tolstoy or Jane Austen might have considered (although they would have produced superior versions of it). But mystery writers usually aren't Tolstoys or Austens, and a first sentence like this one is a signal (buyer beware) that the author is intent on contemplating his or her ''craft'' and wants you to contemplate it too. No thanks.Time is running out, the doors will soon be closing. Here's something much better: ''Stromose was in high school when he met the boy who would someday murder his wife and son.'' High marks for compression, information and what I call the ''angle of lean.'' A good first sentence knows about everything that will follow it and leans forward with great force, taking you with it. As you read this one you already want to find out (a) what was the relationship between the two in high school (b) what happened that turned a ''boy'' into a murderer, and (c) what sequence of events led to his murdering these particular people? The only thing wrong is that the author is as impressed with the sentence as he wants you to be; it is written with a snap and a click of self-satisfaction.And here, finally, is the real thing, efficient, dense, and free of self-preening: ''Joel Campbell, eleven years old at the time, began his descent into murder with a bus ride.'' The name is nicely cadenced and sounds serious; ''eleven years old at the time'' takes the seriousness away, but it comes back with a vengeance and with a question: descent into murder, how did that happen? The answer -- ''with a bus ride'' -- only deepens the mystery, and we're off. And look, the book is big and fat.

Produced by the Israeli company Mayumana, it starts with elements of ''Stomp'' (like drumming on one's chest), throws in some from ''Blue Man Group'' (giant tubes) and then adds sex appeal. It will probably run forever. (I just hope I'm not quoted on the front of the theater.)Describing this show is not easy -- and that's also part of the formula. Some people see ''Blue Man Group'' just to figure out what it's all about. ''Be,'' which has no narrative, and few words or anything else to get in the way of easy cultural translation, has even less content than its predecessors. Yes, finally there's a show for people who thought that ''Stomp'' had too much to say.In its random collection of sketches, there's music of all kinds (rock, flamenco, hip-hop), the kind of dance you might see at a chic New York nightclub and lots of mediocre clowning. The dozen or so performers wear strategically ripped clothes, low-cut tribal get-ups mixed with vulgar accessories and the occasional white biker shorts, all of which seem designed to reveal stone abs, shapely legs and the kind of taut figures that would fit nicely into an advertisement for a gym.These hard-working hard-bodies, led by the co-creators and co-directors, Eylon Nuphar and Boaz Berman, dance and mime and flip for 90 minutes. They toss around glow-in-the-dark balls and they make music with a collection of hollow cylinders. And, of course, they include the audience, asking members of the crowd to help with some drumming on a rhythmic tune.But while ''Stomp'' and ''Blue Man Group'' once were fresh (I think) before familiarity and age turned them into amusement park rides, ''Be'' already seems a little stale, willing to try just about anything to keep our attention.At one point a women starts belly dancing minutes before another does flamenco.

Haygood, a former clinical psychologist who more than three decades ago parlayed her love of classical music into the independent record label Delos, died on March 19 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 87.The cause was cancer, said Carol Rosenberger, the company's vice president for artists and repertory and a close friend.Delos International, originally called Delos Records, has recorded, among others, the conductors James DePreist and Gerard Schwarz; the violinist Corey Cerovsek; the cellists Janos Starker and Zuill Bailey; and Ms. Rosenberger herself, a pianist.Besides classical and modern masterworks, the label has also issued crossover albums, among them ''Heigh-Ho! Mozart'' and ''Bibbidi Bobbidi Bach,'' spoken-word albums, and children's records.Amelia Da Costa Stone was born on July 15, 1919, in Gainesville, Fla.; her father, a judge, taught law at the University of Florida. As a teenager, she studied at the Sorbonne, and in 1941 earned a bachelor's degree in history from the Florida State College for Women, now Florida State University.Moving to Washington, she went to work for the State Department, becoming editor and director of publications for its Interdepartmental Committee on Cultural and Scientific Cooperation. Shortly after World War II, she married J. Douglas Haygood, a clinical psychologist.Training as a psychologist herself, Ms. Haygood went into practice with her husband in Beverly Hills, Calif. After Mr. Haygood's death in 1956, she worked as a consultant to the Los Angeles County Probation Department, developing a treatment program for juvenile offenders and their families.Ms. Haygood is survived by a stepson, Robert Haygood, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 13 step-grandchildren; and several step-great-grandchildren.In the early 1970s, Ms. Haygood began to cast about for a new line of work. ''The field of psychology got taken over by all the touchy-touchy types,'' she told Forbes magazine in 1995. ''I found it a little revolting.''The Haygoods had been passionate classical music fans, and in 1973, with about $150,000 in savings, Ms. Haygood started Delos in her home. She named the company after the Greek island, storied as the birthplace of Apollo, the god of music and poetry. By the mid-1980s, the company was issuing its music exclusively on CDs, among the first classical labels to do so.In 1988, beset by financial reversals, Delos filed for bankruptcy. It emerged from bankruptcy three years later, and by 1995, Forbes reported, it was grossing more than $4 million a year, then about 1 percent of the classical-record market. The label's current net revenues are just under $1 million annually, Ms. Rosenberger said, a result of a general downturn in the market for classical music.Regularly praised for the quality of its sound, Delos also became known as an outlet for American musicians, something Ms. Haygood said she aimed to create from the start.''The only artists getting heard were European,'' she told Forbes in 1995. ''I thought cultural exchange should be a two-way street.''</text></article><article id="1836458"><summary>Morton A Kornreich, former United Jewish Appeal leader, dies at age 82 (S)</summary><text>Morton A. Kornreich, a former national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal and chairman of the UJA-Federation of New York, died Tuesday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 82 and lived in White Plains.The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his son James said.From 1988 to 1990, Mr. Kornreich was national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, formed during World War II to aid Holocaust survivors. In 1985 and 1986, he was president of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York.In 1986, the U.J.A.'s New York branch merged with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and Mr. Kornreich was soon named chairman. That body is the UJA-Federation.Mr. Kornreich was also a vice president of the American Jewish Committee and chairman of its Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations.Morton Alan Kornreich was born on Dec. 4, 1924, a son of Saul and Gertrude Asinoff Kornreich. He and his twin brother, Matthew, were partners in a Manhattan insurance brokerage that their father started in 1917.

Myers, a fisheries biologist whose work brought wide attention to collapsing fish stocks around the world, died on Tuesday in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was 54.His death was announced by Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, where he ran a research laboratory focusing on the effects of industrialized fishing. He had been suffering from glioblastoma multiforme, a brain cancer, since last fall, the university said.Dr. Myers, known as Ram, led a team of scientists who reported in 2003 that 90 percent of the world's stocks of large fish, open-ocean predators like tuna and swordfish and groundfish like cod and flounder, had been lost to overfishing. The scientists said fishing pressure on these species was so great that relatively few fish were living long enough to attain full size or even to reproduce.The study drew criticism from fishery managers and others who took issue with what they called its overly gloomy outlook. But the work was widely praised by environmentalists and marine ecologists, and it put the fishery question onto the front pages of newspapers.Although that work was spectacular, said Daniel Pauly, who heads the Fisheries Center at the University of British Columbia, Dr. Myers's colleagues will remember him for more basic work. Dr. Pauly cited, in particular, Dr. Myers's efforts to solve ''the major problem in fisheries science,'' predicting in one season how many fish larvae will survive to young adulthood in the next.Scientists call this ''the recruitment problem,'' and because fish produce immense and highly variable numbers of larvae and because mortality is so high, good predictions have been hard to come by.Dr. Myers solved the problem, Dr. Pauly said, by assembling a large base of stock data and developing a complex mathematical model to sort it out.''Out of that came the conclusion that a female in general produced three to five recruits per year for most fish,'' Dr. Pauly said. ''It is the definitive study.''Ransom Aldrich Myers was born on June 13, 1952, in Lula, Miss. He received a physics degree at Rice University in 1974 and a doctorate in biology at Dalhousie in 1984. Before joining the Dalhousie faculty, he was a research scientist in the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.Surviving are his wife, Rita Myers, and five children, Emily, Rosemary, Sophia, Carlo and Gioia.He was a lead author of an article on the overfishing of sharks, scheduled to appear in the issue of the journal Science to be released tomorrow.</text></article><article id="1836460"><summary>Marshall Rogers, comic-book artist, dies at age 57; photo (M)</summary><text>Marshall Rogers, a comic-book artist who made his name illustrating Batman at a significant period in 1977 and '78, was found dead by a family member on Saturday at his home in Fremont, Calif. He was 57.The cause has not been determined, said his sister, Suzanne R. Schmachtenberger, of Fort Collins, Colo.Mr. Rogers's work with the writer Steve Englehart on just six issues of Detective Comics was important in redefining Batman, returning him to his pulp roots as an urban vigilante and helping shake off the camp elements popularized by the Adam West television series a decade earlier. These ''Dark Detective'' stories, as they came to be known, laid the blueprint and set the tone for decades of future Batman stories.''You could draw a comic for 30 years and not have the kind of impact that we did,'' Mr. Englehart said.Elements of the ''Dark Detective'' stories were the basis for Tim Burton's ''Batman'' film in 1989 and were adapted into animation in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' on television in the early '90s.Mr. Rogers drew highly detailed architectural features for the moody backdrops of Batman's exploits, down to the individual bricks in the buildings of Gotham, the noir metropolis.Mr. Englehart and Mr. Rogers reunited for a sequel to their original run, published by DC as ''Batman: Dark Detective.'' A third story was being planned when Mr. Rogers died.Born in Flushing, Queens, on Jan. 22, 1950, Marshall Rogers grew up in Ardsley, N.Y. He attended Kent State University in Ohio, where he studied architecture until 1971. That year his parents and sister moved to Colorado, and Mr. Rogers stayed behind on the East Coast to work in comics.He initially drew short backup stories beginning in December 1976, but was soon chosen by the prominent editor Julius Schwartz at DC Comics to draw the lead feature. As his Batman work was taking off, he was also selected to work on the ''Mister Miracle'' series (created by Jack Kirby) and others.He went on to other freelance projects, creating pinups for Marvel Comics publications like ''Howard the Duck'' and ''Star Wars'' before beginning a stint as the artist for ''Dr. Strange.'' In 1987 he again teamed up with Mr. Englehart on Marvel's ''Silver Surfer.''In addition to his sister, Mr. Rogers is survived by his stepson, Russell Young of Fremont; and his mother, Ann White Rogers of Littleton, Colo.</text></article><article id="1836514"><summary>Photo of some of 15 British sailors and marines seized by Iran, as seen on Iranian television</summary><text /></article><article id="1836544"><summary>David Pogue column on new gadgets to resuscitate old audio and video recordings; photo (M)</summary><text>Dearly beloved, let us bow our heads and mourn the passing of so many beloved media storage formats: Home-movie film reels (1932-1975). Floppy disks (1969-2002). Eight-track tapes (3:15 p.m. on Aug. 3, 1965, to around dinnertime on Nov. 5, 1988).Let us also say a prayer for vinyl records, audiocassettes and VHS tapes. They may not be dead yet, but they do wheeze a bit going up stairs.When their time comes, they, too, shall ascend to Format Heaven, where they shall be joyously reunited for all eternity with stone tablets, illuminated manuscripts and cave drawings.But yea, though these recent formats have the approximate shelf life of milk, there is still time to resurrect them. Unto ye I say, copy these crumbling films and disks onto shiny new recordable CDs and DVDs while they still walk among men.Here, then, for your clipping-to-the-fridge pleasure, is the latest wisdom on helping old recordings pass into their next life.AUDIO TAPES -- If the meaningful sonic records of your life are on tape -- audiocassettes or even 8-track cartridges -- you can do the rescue job yourself.You don't even need a computer. Instead, you can buy a stand-alone audio CD recorder, from companies like Sony and Teac, for about $200. You connect your tape deck directly into the CD recorder, hit Play, and record directly onto blank CDs. Some say they offer automatic track detection, which creates a new track on the CD each time it hears an interval of silence; in practice, this technology can be flaky. If you want the CD to recognize each song as a separate track, you'll usually wind up baby-sitting the process and hitting a New Track button at the end of each song.If you have a computer, you can connect your tape deck directly to it. The cable you need has stereo RCA jacks (round red and white) that plug into the tape deck's stereo outputs, and a headphone-style miniplug for the audio input jack on your Mac or PC.Next, equip your computer with some recording software. Free programs abound, like MusicMatch for Windows or Audacity for the Mac. Of course, you'll get better, faster results using programs like Toast (for Macintosh) or Easy Media Creator (Windows), each $80. Each includes special software that eliminates hiss from tapes and crackles and pops from vinyl records.Visit your computer's sound control panel, or the options screen in your recording software, to make sure that it is ''listening'' to the correct audio input (and not, for example, its microphone jack). Once you've set the volume levels, press Play on your tape deck, and Record in the recording software.If you save each song as a separate file on your hard drive, you'll be all set to turn them into traditional tracks on the finished CD. But that entails stopping the tape after every song and exporting the file before continuing. In the real world, many people spare themselves all of that administrative work and treat one side of each audiotape as a single ''song'' on the resulting CD.Once a song has safely arrived on your hard drive, you can export it -- in AIFF or WAV format, for example -- and then import it into a program like iTunes or Windows Media Player for burning to a blank CD.VINYL RECORDS -- The gear you need depends upon the gear you already own.If you have a turntable and a computer, you can follow the same steps described above -- except that in most cases, you also need a preamplifier between them. This little $40 box boosts a record player's feeble signal until it is strong enough for your computer to hear.If you no longer have a record player, $171 buys you Ion's unique iTTUSB turntable, which is designed to connect directly to the U.S.B. jack of a Mac or PC. The music plays straight into an included audio-editing program.If you have neither computer nor turntable, you can turn to a last resort: the Teac GF-350, a cheaply built turntable with a built-in CD recorder ($350). The sound quality isn't great, but those who are neither techno- nor audiophiles may be content.No matter which method you use, a word of advice: If you're going to immortalize your old records on new CDs, clean each LP carefully before beginning.OLD VIDEOTAPES -- If most of your old tapes are on VHS, a dual-deck combination VCR/DVD burner will make the transfer. Such a machine connects to your TV and serves as both a VCR and a DVD player. It can copy a VHS tape onto a blank DVD with one button press. Panasonic and other companies make these decks for $135 and up. (These decks do not duplicate copy-protected disks or tapes.)As a bonus, the same deck can transfer other old tape formats, like 8 millimeter and Hi-8. You just plug your old-format camcorder into the deck's inputs, and burn your home movies to DVD in real time.An alternative is Sony's DVDirect deck ($220), which doesn't require a TV hookup at all. It has its own built-in screen. You plug your camcorder or VCR into its inputs, insert a blank DVD, and hit Record.Once again, the transfer takes place in real time, but at least you can park the thing anywhere and avoid tying up your home-entertainment setup for hours on end.OLD FILM REELS -- If you still have the projector you need to view your old home movies -- Super 8, say, or 16 millimeter -- it's possible to do the transfer to DVD yourself. In theory.You project the movie onto a screen or white wall, as small and sharply focused as possible. Then you use a modern digital camcorder, on a tripod directly in front of the screen, to shoot the image.Afterward, you can transfer the camcorder's footage to a computer, edit it and then burn it to a DVD.This trick is cheap, but it's not ideal. First, it's incredibly time-consuming, since you're sitting through the footage at least twice. Second, if your camcorder doesn't have audio inputs, you'll have a tough time capturing the soundtracks of the films (if any).Worst of all, most film reels haven't been kept cool for the last few decades -- and so the color has begun to shift. Red is the last pigment to disappear, which is why many old home movies look as if they were shot on Mars.Old film can be color-corrected, but not by you, the amateur. Even the drugstores and discount stores that offer film-transfer services generally don't do color correction.That's why most people wind up sending their films to professional transfer labs. These companies use much higher-quality transfer machines -- refrigerator-size reel-to-reel machines called telecine decks -- to convert film into video, and then employ colorists to adjust each scene before committing the result to a DVD.In short, sending your reels away to professionals is convenient and offers the best possible quality -- but it's expensive. MyMovieTransfer.com, for example, charges $20 a reel (each reel is about four minutes long), plus 10 percent if there is sound, plus $10 per DVD or MiniDV tape, plus $10 for FedEx shipping.Some transfer houses also handle videotapes, audiotapes and LPs, for those with more money than time.THE NEXT RESURRECTION -- Thousands of people have rescued their recordings already, and have posted elaborate step-by-step tutorials on the Web. Do a Google search for ''audio tape computer transfer Mac'' or ''transferring LPs to CDs Windows,'' for example.If you opt for the do-it-yourself approach, steel yourself for a fairly lengthy project; depending on the number of old recordings you have to transfer and how many misburned discs you encounter, completing the transfer could take weeks or months.But dearly beloved, just think of what you'll have begot: a stack of shiny new CDs or DVDs that will live in the kingdom of recorded media forever and ever.Or at least until the next format comes along, and you have to do the whole thing again.

As a writer Ms. Didion has a peerless ear for the music of words in motion.And this theatrical version of her account of losing her husband and her daughter within two years includes classic Didionesque sentences, as hard and translucent as hailstones. But it is in the quiet between the words, as she tastes and digests what she has said, that Ms. Redgrave -- playing a character named Joan Didion -- comes closest to capturing Ms. Didion's voice and the delicate layering of harsh feelings that made the book such a stunner.When I first read ''Magical Thinking,'' after experiencing the deaths of three people close to me in as many years, I felt I had been given an enchanted mirror, the kind in fairy tales that tells you the truth about yourself. (For the record I have a slight social acquaintance with Ms. Didion.)Yet at the Booth Theater I never felt the magnetic pull that I experienced in reading the book. Though the script is by Ms. Didion, with many of its sentences lifted directly from the memoir, I never heard Ms. Didion's voice when Ms. Redgrave was speaking.That voice of course is one of the most insistently hypnotic in literature. Try reading Ms. Didion's early novel ''Play It As It Lays'' in one sitting, and then try not thinking in the spare elliptical patterns of her prose. It's impossible. The easiest choice in bringing ''Year'' to the stage would have been to ride the rhythms of that style: a controlled voice that, in keeping chaos and terror at bay, reminds us of their inescapable existence.The stage version emphasizes the everywoman aspect of Ms. Didion's personal anatomy of grief. Like the book, the play is shaped by the harrowing stories of the death in late 2003 of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and of the long, baffling illness of their daughter, Quintana, who died in the summer of 2005. (Her death, at 39, which occurred after Ms. Didion had completed her memoir, forms a new final chapter in the play.)Ms. Redgrave, in a simple pale skirt and blouse, is an imposing, Cassandra-like creature, a prophetess at a temple of doom where we must all someday arrive.Bob Crowley's set (exquisitely accented by Jean Kalman's lighting) is a series of painted drop curtains, suggesting a view of the desert by someone who has stared at the sun for too long.Her first words would seem to confirm her oracular status: ''This happened on Dec. 30, 2003. That may seem a while ago but it won't when it happens to you. And it will happen to you.'' There is no equivalent to this admonition in the book. That's because it isn't necessary.As Ms. Redgrave continues to slide through the narrator's past and present -- from the gray world of hospitals and funeral arrangements to a sunny shared familial past -- she gives sharp life to a variety of moods: fury at medical incompetence and evasiveness, passionate maternal solicitude, conspiratorial feyness as she speaks of her belief that her dead husband will come back to her if only she performs the right actions.Some moments -- yes, silent ones -- are remarkable. I have not, for example, been able to erase from my mind Ms. Redgrave's face from an early scene. It's after she, as Ms. Didion, has spoken of seeing her husband silent and slumped in a chair in their apartment at the end of a trying day. ''I thought he was making a joke,'' she says. ''Slumping over. Pretending to be dead.''Ms. Redgrave's expression conveys two levels of consciousness: She is in the moment she has just described, irritated with what she perceives to be an ill-timed joke. And she is in the present tense -- still angry with herself and the grotesque cosmic prank she has participated in -- because her husband wasn't joking at all.In that small second or two Ms. Redgrave's magnificent face, wry and wounded, is the reproachful emblem of the guilt and exasperation that the living so often feel toward the dying and the dead. There is also reflected that disorientation that comes from a death's abrupt way of changing the rules by which you have always lived your life.Such moments erupt often enough throughout this production, which is directed with austere eloquence by the playwright David Hare, to raise the show well above the level of an audiotape. Students of acting are advised to buy tickets as close as possible to the stage to observe the presence and craft that allows one woman to hold an audience's attention for 90 uninterrupted minutes.But while my eyes never left Ms. Redgrave, I was also never free of a nagging dissatisfaction. I never felt I knew who this woman was. The big emotions register luminously. But do they connect with the portrait of someone who was described on the night of her husband's death by a hospital social worker as ''a pretty cool customer''? Much of what Ms. Didion depicts in her book is the state of self-preserving numbness that descends in crisis.Ms. Redgrave doesn't do numb. She never seems more naturally herself here than when she is quoting, radiantly, from the medieval poem ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.'' As an artist she works on a heroic scale. Ms. Didion is a miniaturist, even when her subjects are vast.And though many of the experiences and feelings described are universal, you cannot separate the impact of the book from Ms. Didion's identity as a writer.This is an early passage from the memoir: ''As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote was to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding what it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish.''The dynamic in the book arises from the tension between this impenetrable style and the emotions that war with it, that mock its elegant self-containment. That Ms. Didion never abandons those careful, chiseled sentences paradoxically leads us straight to the feelings beneath them.When she describes, after a day of trying to keep herself composed and detached, finding to her surprise that she is crying, we know just how she feels. As readers we've been ambushed by a sorrow that was always there but that we were trying to deal with as dispassionately as the narrator.That tension has not been translated to the stage. Ms. Redgrave sounds all the emotional notes in the play clearly and articulately in its first sequences, meaning there's no further journey for her to take us on.The consolation is that Vanessa Redgrave is Vanessa Redgrave, and she has her own means of plumbing depths. Watch, for example, the attention she gives to a bracelet on her arm, and how she develops it. It will break your heart.There is no doubt that she is a great artist. So is Ms. Didion. The problem with ''The Year of Magical Thinking'' is that their artistry pulls in different directions.The Year of Magical ThinkingBy Joan Didion, based on her memoir; directed by David Hare; sets by Bob Crowley; costumes by Ann Roth; lighting by Jean Kalman; sound by Paul Arditti; production stage manager, Karen Armstrong; associate director, B T McNicholl.

Shot in digital video with a skittish, at times urgent freehand, the movie opens in India, where slender adults and scrambling children often fill every inch of the frame amid whorls of color and noise. Later, when the story moves to Denmark, where the bodies are paler and more spatially separated, the chaos of the street will have been replaced by the din of selfish human desire.The plot involves an aid worker, Jacob, played by the eloquently unhappy-looking Mads Mikkelsen, who reluctantly returns to his native Denmark from Mumbai, where he helps run an orphanage. Home to throwaways with dusty feet and solemn smiles, the orphanage is in danger of closing for lack of funds when Jacob receives news of a possible patron. The catch, he glumly learns, is that he has to visit the homeland he left 20 years earlier and to which he has never returned. And so, to Copenhagen he goes, reeled back by a rich man, Jorgen (the jowly, growling Rolf Lassgard, by turns seductive and horrifying), with a beautiful family, a difficult story and a sense of entitlement as absolute as that of a king.Dressed in a cheap suit that hangs off him like a tablecloth, Jacob meets his Danish billionaire, who floats a promise worth millions in funds and tenders an invitation to attend his daughter's wedding. Jacob reluctantly and somewhat uncomfortably agrees. At the wedding, an expensive affair with a big white tent and a crowd of ruddy celebrants, he is surprised to meet an old acquaintance, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen), who happens to be Jorgen's wife. There is the beloved daughter too, Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen), who is marrying one of her father's employees and eager admirers, Christian (Christian Tafdrup), not quite realizing that this smiling young man would as soon marry the old man as her. Every court has its courtiers and every family its complications.Directed by Susanne Bier, whose previous features include ''Open Hearts'' and ''Brothers,'' ''After the Wedding'' is a modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The whiff of the modern comes from the harmonious synchronization of the kinetic camerawork with the abrupt editing patterns, which will be familiar to anyone who has ever watched a Dogme film. Ms. Bier doesn't adhere to all of Dogme's tenets -- found in its so-called vow of chastity -- which exclude, among other things, any music or props not originating at the filmmaking site. Instead she opts for a style that might be called Dogme-lite, which mimics the movement's visual tropes but eschews its ethos and formal rigor to create what is, at core, canned realism.Despite the whooshing camera work, the crashing edits and the hairpin turns in Anders Thomas Jensen's screenplay, ''After the Wedding'' relies on whipped-up familiar ingredients -- a birth, a death, a wedding, a funeral, a man, a woman, another man, another woman -- to pique the audience's interest rather than rock its world. That makes it a fine and, on a scene-by-scene basis, often better than fine, if effectively unadventurous work, in which a man's anguished cry is met by a finale designed to ease the pain. As in many Danish films the performers are top-flight, in particular Mr. Lassgard and Mr. Mikkelsen, an otherworldly screen presence perhaps best known outside Denmark as the villain who weeps blood while giving the lash to James Bond in ''Casino Royale.'' The tears only look more real here.''After the Wedding'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is some adult language and coitus interruptus.After the Wedding  Opens today in New York and Los Angeles.Directed by Susanne Bier; written (in Danish, with English subtitles) by Anders Thomas Jensen, based on a story by Ms. Bier and Mr. Jensen; director of photography, Morten Soborg; edited by Pernille Bech Christensen and Morten Hojbjerg; music by Johan Soderqvist; produced by Sisse Graum Jorgensen; released by IFC Films.

Now, it has re-emerged as a tourist destination with a surprising child-oriented focus.The city is still a place rich with the echoes of history, the Civil War and the civil rights movement. But it's also a place that offers the teen-and-younger set -- on a recent visit, my brood included my son, then 14, and my daughter, then 7 -- many attractions geared especially for them, beginning with the $200 million-plus Georgia Aquarium, called the world's largest, that opened in late 2005.With a metro-area population of five million, Atlanta is a real city, one that may have more than its share of urban woes (traffic, crime), but one that also has bohemian neighborhoods that make for funky exploration and ethnic communities with lively shopping and dining. If your kids are old enough to appreciate what a great metropolitan center has to offer, they'll love Atlanta all the more.The Big Stuff to SeeEven though the inaugural year hoopla has passed, the Georgia Aquarium (225 Baker Street, 404-581-4000; www.georgiaaquarium.org) remains the top tourist destination, welcoming more than three million visitors in 2006. And for good reason: Though the largely indoor attraction can't entirely compare with the child-friendly outdoor places like Sea World with its high-jumping whales and dolphins, it offers a solid half-day's entertainment, with a little bit of education thrown into the mix.Divided into five main themed areas that touch upon aquatic life, both mammals and fish of different kinds, the aquarium is best known for the whale sharks that call the Ocean Voyager section home. Children and adults alike will marvel not only at their size, but also at how they are displayed: in an indoor tank that is up to 30 feet deep. But my children were equally captivated by the penguin exhibit in the Cold Water Quest area. My daughter especially liked standing in an enclosed tube right next to the curious-looking aquatic birds.A visit to the Georgia Aquarium also provides a good excuse to explore the adjoining Centennial Olympic Park (265 Park Avenue West NW, 404-222-7275; www.centennialpark.com), an urban green space that was built in conjunction with the 1996 Olympics. (It was the site of the deadly bombing that occurred during the Games.) The park is more a place to unwind than anything else, but it does have exhibits that honor the athletes and the city leaders behind the Olympics events.Also scheduled to open in May next to the aquarium is the New World of Coca-Cola, a museum about Atlanta's most famous corporation. But the museum, run by Coca-Cola, will remain at its original location (55 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, 404-676-5151, www.worldofcoca-cola.com) through April 7. If you visit, arrive thirsty; there's a tasting room that allows you to sample a variety of Coke products, including some drinks sold abroad that would be hard to find elsewhere in the United States.On a more historical note are two significant attractions: the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site (450 Auburn Avenue NE, 404-331-5190; www.nps.gov/malu) and the Atlanta Cyclorama (800 Cherokee Avenue SE in Grant Park, 404-658-7625). The former offers an overview of King and his leadership in the civil rights movement. You can tour King's birthplace and the church where he preached (Ebenezer Baptist); the visitor center also includes exhibits about King's life and legacy.End your stay by spending a few minutes at King's tomb, which provides a perfect, peaceful opportunity for reflection and discussion with your children.The Atlanta Cyclorama is a work of art and a history lesson about the Civil War rolled into one. True to its name, the Cyclorama, dating from 1893, is a painting in the round (with a diorama added in 1936, giving the work an even greater three-dimensional effect) that depicts the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, 1864. You experience it in a rotating theater, seeing the pivotal day unfold from a variety of vantage points. Even in the age of digital entertainment, it's an effective presentation.CultureLike any major city, Atlanta has more than its share of cultural offerings and attractions, from the High Museum of Art (1280 Peachtree Street NE, 404-733-4444, www.high.org), which is host to an exhibit of works on loan from the Louvre through 2009, to the historic Fox Theatre (660 Peachtree Street NE, 404-881-2100; www.foxtheatre.org), a grand movie palace dating from 1929 that is now home to everything from ballet to Broadway fare.But another option, particularly if you're traveling with children and your time is limited, is the Center of Puppetry Arts (1404 Spring Street NW, 404-873-3391, www.puppet.org). Not only does the 29-year-old center offer an array of shows -- some geared for adults, some for kids -- it also has a worthwhile museum devoted to the history and craft of puppet-making. My daughter enjoyed the brief matinee program she attended, but got a bigger kick because it was followed by a make-your-own-puppet session, led by the center's helpful staff.Alternative AtlantaIf you've got a teen who's into anything and everything alternative, a stroll through Atlanta's Little Five Points neighborhood is a must. (My son remarked that it reminded him more of the scene depicted in ''Rent'' than the increasingly gentrified East Village neighborhood upon which the show-turned-film is based.) Make sure to stop by Junkman's Daughter (464 Moreland Avenue NE; 404-577-3188), a kitsch emporium (or ''alternative superstore,'' as some fans describe it) that sells everything from vintage rock T-shirts to Sigmund Freud action dolls.Where to EatIf your children's preferred diet consists of fast food and more fast food, take them to a place that at least does it with style and a sense of history. For 79 years, the Varsity chain has been turning out chili dogs, onion rings, fried pies and a part-dessert-part beverage concoction simply known as a Frosted Orange. Among the six locations, the downtown one (61 North Avenue, 404-881-1706; www.thevarsity.com) is not only the most convenient, it's also the most impressive, with seating for up to 800. The restaurant staff members boast that on a busy day it can go through enough hot dogs to extend two miles.For sit-down fare with more of a Southern spirit, Mary Mac's Tea Room (224 Ponce de Leon Avenue NE, 404-876-1800, www.marymacs.com), an Atlanta favorite since 1945, is a good bet. Opt for the Southern Special, an all-you-can eat spread of fried and baked chicken, country fried steak, an assortment of sides (and remember, in the South, mac 'n' cheese counts as a veggie) and a dessert of your choice (go for the banana pudding); the special runs $16.95, or $12.50 for children 10 and under.Atlanta is home to many ethnic communities; drive the stretch of road known as Buford Highway and you'll come across everything from Mexican to Korean shopping and dining options. On our visit, my family decided on Korean -- namely, Han Il Kwan (5458 Buford Highway, 770-457-3217), which specializes in barbecue of the do-it-yourself sort. Servers bring the grill and meat to your table -- the classic Korean dish is bulgogi (marinated beef) -- and then you take over. Children are likely to appreciate it as the cross-cultural culinary adventure it is.Where to StayIf money is no object, the ritziest option in downtown Atlanta is, well, the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta (181 Peachtree Street NE, 404-659-0400, www.ritzcarlton.com It has more than 400 rooms, is a short walk from the Georgia Aquarium, and offers a Family Aquarium Package, starting at $309 a night, that includes accommodations, breakfast and admission for up to four people.On the other hand, if you're looking to stay slightly away from downtown, and you want a room that offers more apartment-style amenities, there are two Marriott Residence Inns in the Midtown neighborhood (1365 Peachtree Street, 404-745-1000; www.marriott.com; 1041 West Peachtree Street; 404-872-8885; www.marriott.com). I've always found the chain to be family friendly, with rooms that have full kitchens (hot breakfasts are also included). Both hotels are offering a variety of packages, including one tied to the High Museum's Louvre exhibit; package rates begin at $149 per night.Finally, it's not too hard to land a short-term condo rental in Atlanta. That's what my family did, looking at listings on vacation-rental Web sites before finding a suitable (though somewhat dowdy) one-bedroom downtown apartment through www.vrbo.com for $119 a night.WEEKEND WITH THE KIDS</text></article><article id="1836645"><summary>Ruth Raskin letter on March 23 article about Tracey Towers and other poured concrete buildings designed by architect Paul Rudolph</summary><text>To the Editor: Re ''A Road Trip Back to the Future'' (March 23): I was amazed to read that Tracey Towers in the Bronx had been designed by a renowned architect, Paul Rudolph. As a teenager in the early 1970s, I lived near those monstrosities and went to Bronx Science, which is just down the street from the structures. My friends and I had no idea we were witnessing great architecture being erected. We just complained about how ugly they were and wondered who would live in such dark, foreboding buildings that seemed to have so few windows. I distinctly remember sitting in math class gazing out at them and thinking, ''There goes the neighborhood.Ruth Raskin  Scarsdale, N.Y.</text></article><article id="1836646"><summary>Article on Wellsboro, Pa, as place to live or visit; photos; maps (M)</summary><text>A long row of tall, black gaslights, standing as ramrod straight as soldiers on a parade ground, stretches for several blocks down the middle of Main Street in Wellsboro, Pa. They cast a gauzy, cozy, stay-a-while glow.Some storefronts have changed over the years, but Main Street has held tight to its charm. Wellsboro is not just a place to zip through on the way to nearby Pine Creek Gorge, which is often called the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania. Park your car, slip a dime in the meter, stroll through town -- and putter into the past.''I tell people you can set your watch back 50 years,'' said Nelle Rounsaville, who moved to town 20 years ago and who now owns two bed-and-breakfasts in town and the Wellsboro Diner, an all-porcelain, drum-shaped eatery that has hunkered at the corner of Main Street and East Avenue since 1939.Wellsboro, a town of about 3,300 residents 240 miles northwest of New York City, has become a popular place for second-home buyers who want to remember their first homes -- as in, the homes they grew up in.The town prides itself for being clean, safe and slow-paced. Fittingly, a fountain with a statue of Wynken, Blynken and Nod sits on the wide town green, across Main Street from the old stone Tioga County courthouse and the equally old brick jailhouse.Real estate prices are low compared with those in many other places in Pennsylvania. Grover and Debra Wolf, who own a tree-care business in Oley, Pa., near Reading, bought a three-bedroom, 100-year-old, wood-frame house near the center of Wellsboro last August for $173,500.The house was moved 50 to 100 feet about 15 years ago so that the lot could be subdivided, Mr. Wolf said. It was placed on a cement-block foundation and fitted with new plumbing and a modern kitchen. But the original oak woodwork remains.''We bought all the charm -- with all new fixings,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''I didn't want to spend a lot of time when I came up here working on a house.''While in Wellsboro, which they visit every two weeks, the Wolfs like to explore the town with their son, Tanner, 7, and venture to Pine Creek Gorge, which is about 10 miles west of town, not far off United States Route 6. ''For us, it was getting our child to an area that was safe,'' Ms. Wolf said, ''an area promoting small community.''Pine Creek Gorge, formed by melting glaciers and dotted with trees that show off blazing colors in the fall, is itself a destination. A railroad bed along meandering Pine Creek was turned into a bicycle trail. The gorge, which cuts deep into the Appalachian Plateau, is also an ideal place to hike, fish, hunt and camp and to ride snowmobiles and horses.''There are things to do, but they're quiet things to do,'' said Scott Wilcox, a Wellsboro native and agent for Century 21 Wilkinson-Dunn, which is on Main Street.The SceneShops along Main Street have slowly changed hands in the past few years and have become tonier. On the south side of Main Street are the Fifth Season antiques store and Pine Creek Outfitters (which offers raft trips and canoe and bicycle rentals). A former five-and-dime is now the Blue Thistle Boutique, which sells women's clothing, and a popular Italian restaurant, the Timeless Destination.Just off Main Street is a bagel shop and an old-timey movie house, the Arcadia -- ''Tioga County's Finest Theatre,'' the marquee reads. Plans are under way to build a performing arts center not far from the old courthouse and the jail, which is now home to the chamber of commerce and the Tioga County Visitors Bureau.''Don't ever call this place 'hillbilly,' because the people are sophisticated,'' said Ed Lodge, who lives part time in Chester County, Pa., and bought a 2,500-square-foot second home in Wellsboro for $305,000 in November 2005.The gaslights stop a block or two west of the town green, and Main Street turns residential. The street, and the small neighborhood that surrounds it, are lined with simple and handsome older homes, many with wood frames, but some made of brick. Wellsboro is nestled in tall hills, which are covered with trees that seem to trudge up the slopes.Marsha and Bob Chesko first drove through Wellsboro eight years ago, when they still lived in Orlando, Fla. They liked the town so much that they ended up buying the Sherwood Motel. Most of their guests come up the same week every year, and request the same room.''We've watched the 'Andy Griffith Show' on TV,'' Ms. Chesko said, ''and we said to each other, 'This is just like Mayberry.' It's such a small, quaint town.''ProsUnited States Route 15, which connects Tioga County to Interstate 80, has been widened in recent years, trimming the weekend trip for second-home owners substantially. Mansfield University is about 15 miles to the east, and offers sports and cultural events. A newsworthy crime is often a whodunit that centers on a blown-up mailbox.ConsOn summer and autumn weekends, the streets in Wellsboro can be clogged with traffic. Wellsboro has a McDonald's and a Dunkin' Donuts, but it is still a small and isolated town. The closest Wal-Mart, for example, is in Mansfield.''The very things we like are the things that 18-year-olds growing up here don't like,'' Mr. Wolf said.The Real-Estate MarketRichard Tickner, an agent for Koch Homestead Realty in Wellsboro, estimated that the value of homes in Wellsboro and in the region has increased by 12 to 15 percent since 2000.Mr. Tickner had his best year ever in 2006, but said: ''We don't get the great big ups and the great big downs as in other places. It's very stable.''Kathy Doty, a broker with Penn Oak Realty in Wellsboro, said: ''We always appreciate in value, but it's a slow, steady climb. People realize they're moving here because they like the area.''Mr. Wilcox, the Century 21 agent, said that second homes were used differently now than they had been in the past. State Route 287, which weaves through mountains north into town, is speckled with hunting cabins that are now used at times other than deer season.''When I was growing up, people would come up and use their hunting camps one or two weeks the whole year,'' Mr. Wilcox said. ''Now, they're using them two or three months out of every year.''Paul and Ellen Harrison, empty-nesters who own a general contracting business in Easton, Pa., bought a two-bedroom cabin on eight isolated acres west of town in 2001 for $105,000. They nearly sold the cabin two years later for $140,000, but decided to keep the property after prospective buyers backed out.Mr. Harrison estimates that they spend every third weekend at the cabin, which sits among thousands of white birch trees. They have rented the cabin to cover their costs (their Web site is www.whitebirchcabins.com), but Mr. Harrison said they were thinking about keeping the place to themselves.''It's pretty hard to leave once we get there,'' he said.LAY OF THE LANDPOPULATION -- 3,342, according to a 2005 estimate by the Census Bureau. Tioga County's population is estimated to be about 41,000. The population of the county can swell to approximately 80,000 on summer and fall weekends.SIZE -- 4.9 square miles.LOCATION -- North-central Pennsylvania. Wellsboro is about 50 miles north of Williamsport, 135 miles north of Harrisburg, 230 miles northwest of Philadelphia and 240 miles northwest of New York City.WHO'S BUYING -- Mostly residents from south-central Pennsylvania cities, like Reading, Harrisburg and Lancaster, and residents of the Philadelphia suburbs.GETTING THERE -- From the New York area, take Interstate 80 west to Exit 210B, to Route 15 north, to Route 6, then 12 miles west into town.WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING -- The Sherwood Motel (2 Main Street, 570-724-3424; www.sherwoodmotel.org) offers rates of $79 to $105 from May 1 to the first weekend in December, and $63 to $73 at other times. La Belle Auberge, at 129 Main Street, and La Petite Auberge, 3 Charles Street (570-724-3288; www.nellesinns.com), two bed-and-breakfasts on the west side of town, offer rooms starting at $155 on weekends from May through early December, and $135 for the rest of the year.THREE FOR SALE  Clean, Safe, Slow-Paced: A Place That Feels Like the 1950sInformation on properties was provided by the listing companies.WHAT -- 3-bedroom house  HOW MUCH -- $162,500This 50-year-old, 1,536-square-foot ranch is on a half-acre near downtown Wellsboro.

''Now I can walk into any Park Slope coffeehouse and someone will be talking about the documentary that they are making.''At documentary film festivals, that means more films -- a competitive challenge for the independent filmmaker, Ms. Wade said, ''but great for audiences.''Her 38-minute film ''Freeheld'' -- about a New Jersey police officer and cancer victim who fought to leave her pension to her lesbian partner -- won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January and will be in competition for the Short Grand Prix at the Chicago International Documentary Film Festival, where more than 100 films are being shown today through April 8.The Chicago festival is one of several documentary-only events around the United States and Canada this spring. And while the popularity of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' and other recent films is sure to draw attention to the documentary category this year at larger, more comprehensive film festivals, like TriBeCa in New York or the San Francisco International Film Festival, the documentary-only festivals have a special appeal. Audiences can expect a much wider range of styles and subjects than would be found at a general film festival, where documentaries are only a ''10- or 20-film sidebar,'' said Christopher Kamyszew, the Chicago festival's director.International films will have a big presence in Chicago. Among those competing with ''Freeheld'' for the top short-film prize are ''Children of Darfur'' by the Danish director Camille Nielsson, and ''Blockade,'' about the siege of Leningrad in World War II, by the Russian director Sergei Loznitsa.Many documentary festivals offer filmgoers contact with the filmmakers. In Toronto next month, about 50,000 people are expected for the Hot Docs Festival, which will show 129 films from 23 countries. Chris McDonald, executive director of the festival, said that the directors of about 85 percent of the films are expected to be available to answer questions.Among them will be Risa Morimoto, whose ''Wings of Defeat'' looks at Japanese veterans who were once pilots in kamikaze units, and Arne Johnson, director of ''Girls Rock,'' about a rock 'n' roll camp for girls.For a different slant, there's the Portland Documentary and Experimental Festival in Oregon, where experimental filmmakers and documentarians will mingle with one another (and with audiences) to trade ideas and push the boundaries of both genres.AMONG the more talked-about films to be screened there is ''Strange Culture,'' directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson. It tells the story of the artist and professor Steve Kurtz, who had his assets impounded and was detained as a suspected bioterrorist. Because the case was still open when the film was being made, there's a twist: the ''documentary'' was enacted by professional actors.''We do occasionally show some more straight-up documentaries,'' said Gretchen Hogue, the director of the Portland festival. ''But we're definitely looking for ones that push the genre into a new place and create some nontraditional techniques to tell their stories.''For filmmakers like Ms. Wade, an important part of going to some of the larger festivals this spring, like the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in Durham, N.C. (sponsored partly by The New York Times), is ''networking with other filmmakers.'' But for audiences, these events are simply a chance to see great films and sit in on fascinating discussions.The Silverdocs American Film Institute/Discovery Channel Documentary Festival, held annually just outside Washington, includes question-and-answer sessions with directors and appearances by prominent journalists and policy specialists from around Washington.Last year, for example, former Vice President Al Gore gave the keynote speech, and Ann Curry, the NBC journalist, and Susan Blumenthal, a former federal health official, took part in a panel discussion after a screening of ''The Blood of Yingzhou District,'' a film about AIDS in China.Patricia Finneran, the festival's director, said that a feature of all-documentary film festivals is the attention they draw to the lives of ordinary people -- a contrast to the emphasis at larger festivals including narrative films, where often ''the celebrity aspect gets all the attention.''''It's really great to have a place where you're just celebrating documentary filmmakers and their work,'' Ms. Finneran said, ''and where the stars are the people in the films.''DETAILSThe ticket prices below are for general admission.

In his dumb but endearing sports comedies, the spirit may be willing, but the flesh is flabby. As he ricochets from triumph to humiliation and back, he suggests an armchair George Plimpton whose characters, driven by an outlandish grandiosity, are deeply reassuring. For the sake of his career, Mr. Ferrell should never join a gym; buffed up, he would cease being one of us.In ''Blades of Glory'' his character -- Chazz Michael Michaels, a preening rock 'n' roll-style figure skater, hard drinker and self-proclaimed sex addict -- is quintessential Ferrell: a macho caricature with a gooey sweet filling that leaks through the cracks of his heavy-metal armor. As he lurches and lunges through a routine to the roar of the Billy Squier anthem ''The Stroke,'' Chazz is almost fearsome. But by the end of this fast, light, frequently funny comedy, your instinct is to pet his mullet and go ''Awwww.''Mr. Ferrell and Jon Heder (of ''Napoleon Dynamite'') play rival skaters who were banned from the ice following a public brawl; Mr. Heder's character, Jimmy MacElroy, is the whiny, arrogant adopted child of a billionaire (William Fichtner) who abandons him on a roadside after his ouster from the sport. After spending three years in exile, Chazz and Jimmy re-enter figure skating the only way the rules allow: as a team.As these mismatched egomaniacs develop a fraternal bond, their chemistry jells, and Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. Jimmy, with his fleecy platinum hair and downy cheeks, is a brat itching for a comeuppance, and Mr. Heder's Bugs Bunny teeth and myopic gaze complete the picture of the sports prodigy as idiotic, self-centered robot. The character seems only a hair's-breadth away from Napoleon Dynamite.It comes as a huge relief to find that as ''Blades of Glory'' speeds along, it avoids going to the obvious, ugly place for cheap laughs. The notion of a male figure-skating team in which one member is a chest-beating, fire-breathing Lothario and the other a persnickety, virginal girly-man cries out for the kind of easy, gay-baiting jokes that mars comedies like ''Wild Hogs.''It's not that ''Blades of Glory'' is entirely unaware of its largely untapped subtext. In Sarah Kawahara's amusing ice skating choreography, sliding scissor kicks land faces in crotches, and groins grind into groins. But the humor lies more in the ooh-that-must-hurt category than in any suggestion that such collisions might be sexy.The movie's satirical take on competitive figure skating, from its music for gliding pas des deux (Andrea Bocelli) to the goofy absurdity of children's ice shows in which Chazz, exiled from competition, is forced to work, to its tacky space-age costumes, is affectionately knowing.When Chazz and Jimmy make their comeback, they are pitted against a ruthless European brother-sister team with an incestuous bond, the Van Waldenbergs (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), who blackmail their meek sister (Jenna Fischer) into using her charms to break up the American partners. This is one of several subplots shoehorned into the movie for strictly mechanical reasons.The Van Waldenbergs have a potentially great comic moment near the end of the movie that is all but thrown away. In their breathtakingly tasteless routine at the movie's version of the Winter Olympics, they impersonate John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe as lovers on ice. Alas, all the movie gives us is about 30 seconds of what might have been a classic, ''Borat''-worthy sketch.More successful are a drawn-out stumbling chase on skates through the streets of Montreal, and Chazz and Jimmy's decision to execute an extremely dangerous (and funny) maneuver developed in North Korea.Despite its missed opportunities, ''Blades of Glory'' introduces some fresh talent into the Hollywood comedy pool. Its directors, Will Speck and Josh Gordon, come from advertising, having created those ubiquitous television commercials for Geico insurance. However tired of the Geico caveman you may be, you must admit that the campaign, when new, had a rare spark of wit. ''Blades of Glory'' has enough vestiges of that kind of creative cheek to keep you contentedly in your seat.''Blades of Glory'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color sexual humor and some strong language.Blades of Glory  Opens today nationwide.Directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon; written by Jeff Cox, Craig Cox, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky, based on a story by Craig Cox, Jeff Cox and Busy Philipps; director of photography, Stefan Czapsky; edited by Richard Pearson; music by Theodore Shapiro; production designer, Stephen Lineweaver; produced by Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and John Jacobs; released by Paramount Pictures.

Pattern. Repetition.''Those words are intoned in voice-over by Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a brain-damaged bank janitor who narrates the screenwriter Scott Frank's directorial debut, the Midwestern crime drama ''The Lookout.'' They're catch phrases learned in therapy, designed to help Chris regain the sense of chronology he lost in a car accident. But they also acknowledge that ''The Lookout'' is a new version of a very old story: A nobody falls in with scuzzball crooks who make him feel like somebody.Scuzzball No. 1 is Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode), a former classmate who taps Chris to play lookout in a planned robbery of Chris's suburban bank in Kansas City, Kan. No. 2 is Bone (Greg Dunham), a longhaired, trench-coated killer who looks like a ''Matrix'' character played by Sam Shepard. No. 3 is a former stripper who calls herself Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher). Is she more wholesome than her companions, or does it just seem that way because she puts on a frumpy nightgown before seducing Chris?Mr. Frank's screenplay for ''The Lookout'' was long considered one of Hollywood's great unproduced scripts. The end product doesn't justify that buildup. Some of the minor characters are thinly drawn (particularly Luvlee, who never manifests the femme fatale qualities her plot function seems to require). And Chris's last-act conversion from sad-sack patsy to devious score-settler is not persuasive. Still, there's a lot to like here, and the film's bleak setting and empathetic tone add interest to what could have been a by-the-numbers affair.Mr. Frank, who is best known for adapting the Elmore Leonard novel ''Out of Sight'' for Steven Soderbergh, has a clean, purposeful directing style, particularly in the quick-cut sequences that show Chris shambling through his daily routine. And he displays sincere interest in Chris's roiling emotions, which are grasped only by his best friend and roommate, the blind ex-criminal Lewis (Jeff Daniels).With its country music characterizations and its wintry panoramas (by the snow specialist Alar Kivilo, who also shot ''A Simple Plan'') ''The Lookout'' feels less like a modern film noir than a social drama with noir trappings. Several major characters live with mental or physical afflictions (even Gary, who carries the go-to accessory of modern screen goons, an inhaler). The potential haul is pocket change compared to the amounts bandied about in Jerry Bruckheimer epics, and some of the participants seem as though they would back out if they sensed there was another quick way to improve their social station.Even Chris falls into this category. The son of a pompous rich man (Bruce McGill), he is determined to make his own way despite handicaps that he refuses to see as handicaps. He would not have gotten involved with Gary if his condescending boss had allowed him to train as a teller; a rare encouraging statement by that same boss spurs his 11th-hour doubts.The movie is worth seeing for its cast. Like Lee Marvin in his thug mode, Mr. Goode, with his mix of intelligence, cruelty and self-loathing, is both repugnant and fascinating. Mr. Daniels initially seems to overplay the blind man's eccentric charisma until you realize that Lewis has fashioned himself into a ''character'' to mask his feelings of dependence.Ms. Fisher's tricky line readings suggest that Luvlee is not the plush waif she appears to be, particularly in a scene in which Lewis reveals how he lost his sight, and she deadpans, ''That is a sad story. I'm sorry, if it's true.''Most impressive of all is Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who is convincing as one of cinema's most difficult archetypes: the reactive protagonist whose complex emotions are visible to the viewer but invisible to his fellow characters.

Nike, who is a few years younger, is a home-care worker for elderly invalids who shuttles among several clients. The two women regularly meet for drinks over which they commiserate about the dearth of men in their lives.The city is wilting in a summer heat wave, and the movie conveys a mood of torpid enervation. A minor incident in which Katrin narrowly escapes being hit by a truck while crossing the street brings the truck's stringy, monosyllabic driver, Ronald (Andreas Schmidt), into their lives. When Nike, on the prowl, later spots him in a bar, she brings him home for sex.Ronald appears to be a nonentity, but as Nike falls in love with him, he emerges as a furtive, womanizing leech who expects her to wait on him hand and foot.In the movie's dry-eyed vision of the modern mating game, lonely single women willingly tolerate their lovers' arrogance and insensitivity in exchange for the kind of regular good sex Ronald seems to provide. As Nike serves him without complaint, he behaves like a spoiled little prince.The movie is alert to every nuance of the couple's unacknowledged power struggle. Its psychic radar is attuned just as acutely to the fluctuations in Katrin's and Nike's friendship once Ronald enters the picture. Katrin, who is developing a serious drinking problem, isn't as attractive or as stable as Nike, and when their intimacy is threatened, she goes off the deep end. Her unvoiced envy and resentment explode after Ronald deliberately stirs up trouble by putting the moves on her in Nike's presence.An underdeveloped subplot observes similar games played by Max, a manipulative woman with whom he is besotted, and his running buddy, whom she is pursuing.Ms. Friedrich and Ms. Uhl sink so completely into their discontented characters that you don't have the sense of observing performances so much as watching lives being lived. Mr. Schmidt accomplishes the difficult task of imbuing a louse with a sly charm.The low-key realism is so meticulously maintained that ''Summer in Berlin'' feels somewhat trivial. There is nothing larger here than meets the eye. It is ''Sex and the City'' on a stringent budget with fewer characters, in which Mr. Big is Mr. Sneaky Loser, and the only coveted shoes are the 120-euro running sneakers Max desperately desires but his mother can't afford.Summer in Berlin  Opens today in Manhattan.Directed by Andreas Dresen; written (in German, with English subtitles) by Wolfgang Kohlhaase; director of photography, Andreas H&#246;fer; edited by J&#246;rg Hauschild; music by Pascal Comelade; production designer, Susanne Hopf; produced by Peter Rommel and Stefan Arndt; released by D Street Releasing.

Baseball season starts April 1, as does the 3rd quarter of Fiscal Year 2007. You've drafted a powerhouse fantasy-baseball team; here are our picks for the ultimate fantasy-office roster.Andrew Epstein  Position: Agent-manager, Epstein Insurance Agency. Cost: $225,000  This seasoned professional is coming off an all-star F.Y. 2006 marred by a fourth-quarter ulcer that limited his working time. A regimen of Zen meditation has speeded his return to The 17th-Floor Office Suite That Epstein Built, but analysts doubt he can match his previous Q3 numbers: nine successful road trips, two OPS (Ominous Pink Slips) and an electrifying 1.00 E.R.A. (Extramarital Relations Affairs) with Clara Boyd. His Intimidation Metric of two-thirds of employees has slipped drastically -- a sign of diminishing power -- from his prime when he wildly headhunted to replace personnel who gave less than 110 percent. Still a blue-chip pick, but watch out for a hardball contested divorce that could dampen workplace morale.Adrienne Flack  Position: Insurance agent. Cost: $95,000  The staff workhorse, last year A-Flac had 220 quality workdays (defined as staying past 6 p.m., entitling her to compensation of an entree and beverage from Antonio's Deli) with just five blown deals. Nevertheless, this contract-closer needs improved self-control: her weekly M.E.M.K.J. (Mass E-mails of Monsieur Kittens JPEGs) ballooned to 3.95, and when she's not captain of group projects she sinks into moody slumps. Pencil her in for the second round, but only if she learns that 1) no one else thinks her scrofulous Siamese is a super-cutie and 2) there's no ''I'' in ''insurance team.'' Except for that first one.Clara Boyd  Position: Administrative assistant. Cost: $36,000  The Secretary of Offense flirted with a .400 WAYHFLA (What Are You Having For Lunch? Average) and registered an untouchable 56 birthdays-remembered streak. Moreover, Epstein's singling her out as the designated hit-on may result in a promotion to the HR roster. But will her out-of-left-field hookup with the temp during the Alaska Hurricane Insurance deal-clinching party -- clocked by the manager's radar -- keep her on the receptionist's desk bench? Fourth round, or the third if Epstein's wife finally throws him out of the house and he becomes a free insurance agent.Nathaniel Moscow  Position: Temp. Cost: $12.50/hour  Moscow was a hit right off the bat as a September call-up with the office females after Bess Tremper went down with maternity leave. His dexterity in turning the coffee-and-copies double play makes him an attractive fifth-rounder, as does his lowballed cost and ironic lack of health insurance. The Kid, as he's called by senior co-workers who have yet to learn his name, led the office with 14.61 W.C.T./8Hrs (Water Cooler Trips/8 Hours) and 39 stolen glue sticks -- but was caught Minesweeping seven times. Unless he shows more hustle, Moscow could be sent back down to the welfare rolls, especially since his bush-league attempt at extra bases with Boyd put him on the boss's warning track -- a classic rookie mistake by a free-swinger with a chase-anything-close approach. But the front office may sign him to a multiyear extension if it considers the lefty art-school grad's West Side Underwriters Softball League crackerjack stats for the Epstein Claims Adjusters (.388 EqA, 1.06 WHIP, 95.6 VORP). Possible curveball: Moscow's string of erratic Monday-morning starts has fueled rumors he's violating the office's three strikes substance-abuse policy and may necessitate a rehab stint in A.A.Will Jameson  Position: Custodian. Cost: $5.15/hour  A handy utility man, Jameson provides consistent, if not sparkling, production in the cleanup role and is a bargain at the federal minimum. Will his recent double-headers moonlighting as a bellhop affect his numbers with Epstein? Third-quarter projections: the hotel's full of screwballs, so there'll be a rise in his B.A.A. (Bawdy Anecdote Average), but fatigue will cramp his R.T.I.L.H.C.F.T. (Repairs These Ivy League Hotshots Can't Fix Themselves). With the blue-collar Jameson's appearances limited to mop-up duty, expect lower office-wide Pecota (Proletarian Economic-Consciousness and Ousted-Teamster Awareness). If he slides to the sixth, pick him up and get one more year out of his aging broom, then make a North American free trade for a cheaper janitor to be named later in time for the next spring cleaning. It may sound underhanded, but remember: it's a business, not a game, and nice fantasy C.E.O.'s finish last.Op-Ed Contributors Teddy Wayne is a student at Washington University in St. Louis.

Malone and Advance/Newhouse Communications, to a two-thirds and one-third stake, respectively.It was not clear, however, whether Mr. Malone's increased stake -- he has held 50 percent, compared with 25 percent each for Advance/Newhouse and Cox -- would ultimately translate into clear control of the company. Currently, any significant decisions at the company are subject to approval of 80 percent of the company's shareholders, and that is not expected to change as part of the Cox transaction.The move could set the stage for Discovery to become a publicly traded company. It is privately held, but two years ago the Liberty Media Corporation of Mr. Malone set up a separate publicly traded subsidiary, the Discovery Holding Company, to hold its stake in the company as well as some other smaller Liberty assets.That company has been something of an oddity as Mr. Malone does not control Discovery and the other shareholders declined to participate in the public holdings. Mr. Malone has said his strategy is to have a greater role in operating the businesses in which his company has invested.Cox's planned exit from the partnership comes soon after the company hired a new chief executive, David M. Zaslav, from NBC Universal. Mr. Zaslav has restructured management and repositioned the company as both a leading ''nonfiction'' media company with global reach but one that, unlike many other cable channel operators, owns most of its own libraries.''This proposed transaction will simplify Discovery's ownership structure, further streamline our operations and give the company more strategic flexibility,'' Mr. Zaslav said in a statement.Discovery Channel, introduced in the United States in 1985, is now distributed in 170 countries. The company's other brands include TLC, Animal Planet and Discovery Health.</text></article><article id="1836736"><summary>Four people are killed in Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas after 65 tornadoes sweep through six states; photo (M)</summary><text>Four people were killed in Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas after 65 tornadoes swept through six states on Wednesday, officials said yesterday.Two people died when a tornado swirled through their rural neighborhood near Elmwood, Okla., a state emergency official, Dixie Parker, said. They were identified as Vance and Barbra Woodbury, a husband and wife.The authorities spread into Beaver County on Wednesday, warning residents to take shelter and to offer assistance, Mrs. Parker said. ''There was no house left,'' she said. ''It was demolished, and we found them in the field. One was still alive, the husband. He passed away just before the ambulance got there.''The tornado appeared to have cut through their house, as the closest neighbors had just uprooted trees, Mrs. Parker said.Tornadoes also struck Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska, said Patrick Slattery of the National Weather Service, with some regions pummeled by large hailstones and heavy snowfall.''It was a big storm, a big system,'' Mr. Slattery said. ''The majority of these were almost in a straight north-south line along the Kansas-Nebraska border. The effects stretched from Colorado and Wyoming, with blowing snow.''In Carbon County, Wyo., 19 inches of snow fell. Hail an inch and three-quarter inches in diameter, about the size of a golf ball, fell in the Nebraska Panhandle, he added.In Holly, Colo., a town of 1,500 people east of Lamar, a woman and two children were found dangling in a tree on Wednesday night, County Coroner Joe Giardone said. The woman, Rosemary Rosales, 28, died of injuries. The children and at least nine other people were injured, Mr. Giardone said, with seven taken to trauma centers.In the Texas Panhandle outside Amarillo, an oilfield worker from Oklahoma, Monte Ford, 53, was killed when the tornado hit his trailer, Tela Mange of the Public Safety Department said.At least three people were injured in the panhandle, The Associated Press reported.In Nebraska, houses were damaged or destroyed in Dundy and Perkins. No casualties were reported. Residents had left the areas, which are hilly in some parts but include flat farmland and grazing fields.''One thing we can say is they are areas of low population,'' said Cindy Newsham, the response and recovery division manager of the state's Emergency Management Agency. ''We can have tornadoes that go through a lot of area but don't hit anything.''</text></article><article id="1836737"><summary>Photo of Pres Bush bestowing Congressional Gold Medal on some-300 Tuskegee Airmen of World War II in ceremony at Capitol</summary><text /></article><article id="1836741"><summary>Correction of March 16 travel article about reopening of resorts at French Lick, Ind (S)</summary><text>An article on March 16 about the reopening of resorts at French Lick, Ind., misstated the name of a golf tournament that Walter Hagen won there in 1924.

Directed by Peter Miller  Not rated; 81 minutesThis feature filmmaking debut by Peter Miller (a PBS veteran and longtime collaborator of Ken Burns) hews to standard television documentary format: archival photographs and talking heads. But the movie's meat-and-potatoes style seems less a failure of imagination than a means of putting in the foreground its subject matter: the tale of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Italian immigrants and outspoken anarchists charged with the 1920 robbery of a Massachusetts shoe factory and the murder of two of its employees.The film's first half details Sacco and Vanzetti's personalities, upbringing and political beliefs; the beliefs are articulated via letters read by the actors John Turturro (Vanzetti) and Tony Shalhoub (Sacco). The second half follows the duo's two trials, six years of protests and appeals and 1927 execution.Throughout, Mr. Miller incorporates relevant film clips (including Giuliano Montaldo's 1971 drama ''Sacco e Vanzetti'') and songs (notably Woody Guthrie's protest song ''Red Wine,'' performed on camera by Arlo Guthrie). Testimony by historians -- a couple of whom are moved to tears, contemplating the story -- compares Sacco and Vanzetti's demonization by a society terrified of anarchism and immigrants to the mistreatment of Middle Easterners after 9/11.Less didactic and more piercing is the sense that two human beings were killed despite inconclusive or conflicting evidence, as an example to fellow travelers. The judge in the case, Webster Thayer, told the jury, referring to Vanzetti, ''This man, although he may not have actually committed the crime attributed to him, is nevertheless culpable, because he is the enemy of our existing institutions.''MATT ZOLLER SEITZ</text></article><article id="1836836"><summary>Joel Brodsky, photographer whose work appeared on covers of hundreds of albums, dies at age 67; photo (M)</summary><text>Joel Brodsky, a photographer whose work appeared on the covers of hundreds of albums -- most memorably ''The Best of the Doors,'' with its provocative Christlike image of Jim Morrison in black and white -- died on March 1 in Stamford, Conn., where he had lived for five years. He was 67 and had previously lived in Manhattan.The cause was a heart attack, his daughter Jill Holt said.Mr. Brodsky did the photography for more than 400 album covers, specializing in rock and soul performers like Isaac Hayes, Country Joe and the Fish and Iggy Pop. He also photographed blues singers, including Buddy Guy and Junior Wells.His album cover shoots were all paid jobs for record companies, Ms. Holt said, and to the end of his life Mr. Brodsky approached photography more as work than as art.At a presentation of his work for the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York last year, he explained how he shot the cover for ''The Isaac Hayes Movement'' (1970) through metallic foil to achieve an effect that resembled rain.''When you get something that works,'' Mr. Brodsky said, ''you stay with it.''Joel Lee Brodsky was born in Brooklyn and became interested in photography through a college class. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1960, found a job at a camera store in Brooklyn soon after, and had opened his own studio by 1964.His first album cover shot was of the folk singer Eric Andersen. Mr. Brodsky agreed to photograph Mr. Andersen as a favor to a friend of Mr. Brodsky's wife. He shot what became known as the ''young lion'' session, the Morrison photos that made him famous, in 1966.By 1980 Mr. Brodsky had moved from photographing musicians to doing advertising work for Revlon, Avon, DuPont and other companies.Mr. Brodsky's work has been shown at the Govinda Gallery in Washington and the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles.He is survived by his wife, Valerie, of Stamford; three daughters, Jill Holt of North Salem, N.Y., Alexandra Alland of Boston and Brooke, of Manhattan; his sister, Roberta Willenkin of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.Ms. Holt said that her father loved music, but that although the Doors were the subjects of the images that made him well known, he did not particularly enjoy theirs.</text></article><article id="1836838"><summary>Toshio Sasaki, Japanese sculptor known for works in public places, dies at age 60; photo (M)</summary><text>Toshio Sasaki, a Japanese sculptor known for works in public spaces, particularly ''The First Symphony of the Sea,'' a 322-foot-long wall relief at the New York Aquarium at Coney Island, died on March 10 near his home in Nagakute in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. He was 60 and also had a home in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.The cause was stomach cancer, his wife, Miyo, said.Mr. Sasaki, whose work has been described as more surrealist than abstract, was one of eight finalists in the design competition for the World Trade Center memorial.He completed the well-known wall on the Coney Island boardwalk in 1993. Constructed from four tons of concrete, the wall evokes the living creatures inside the building with embedded multihued mosaic fish heads and terrazzo starfish.In 2003, Mr. Sasaki's ground zero submission, ''Inversion of Light,'' included a representation of the north tower's footprint with light shining from below and a reflecting pool above a circle of light as a representation of the south tower's footprint. Other elements included water trickling over a glass wall etched with victims' names and a column honoring unidentified remains, with a blue laser aimed at the sky, between the tower sites.The competition was eventually won by the architect Michael Arad.Born in Kyoto on Nov. 24, 1946, Mr. Sasaki was a son of Tetsuji and Tsune Mori Sasaki. His father was a carpenter who specialized in the intricate interiors of Buddhist temples.Besides his wife, Mr. Sasaki is survived by three brothers, Yasuo, Shigehiko and Morio, all of Osaka.Mr. Sasaki graduated from the Aichi Prefectural University of Fine Art and Music in 1972. Two years later, he and his wife came to the United States. Mr. Sasaki had won a scholarship to study at the Brooklyn Museum Art School.His works have been exhibited in Washington, in Philadelphia, at the South Beach Psychiatric Center on Staten Island and in Central Park.He recently completed a 40-by-30-foot facade for a new public library in Long Island City, Queens. The facade, with geometric shapes on cast-stone panels, is inscribed with quotations about art, literature and science. Days before he died, his wife said yesterday, Mr. Sasaki bought a plane ticket to New York to take a final look at the mural.</text></article><article id="1836839"><summary>Tony Scott, major jazz clarinetist who mastered bebop, dies at age 85; photo (M)</summary><text>Tony Scott, a distinguished jazz clarinetist who in the 1950s helped steer his instrument out of the swing era and into the sax-infested waters of bebop, died on Wednesday at his home in Rome. He was 85 and had lived in Italy for many years.The apparent cause was complications of the prostate cancer Mr. Scott had many years ago, his wife, Cinzia, said.With Buddy DeFranco, Mr. Scott was considered one of the leading bebop clarinetists. (The two men were often described as the only major clarinetists to take on bebop, a style thought to be incompatible with the instrument's soft, sweet sound.) Mr. Scott, who also played the saxophone, performed and recorded with some of the titans of mid-20th-century jazz, among them Duke Ellington, Ben Webster, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday.If Mr. Scott was not widely known to the American public, it was partly because his eclectic style made him unclassifiable: over the years, he ranged through bebop and what today would be called New Age and world music. It was also because he was peripatetic: for decades he roamed the globe, clarinet in hand. He had lived mostly abroad since the late '50s.Mr. Scott was also well regarded as a composer and arranger. His composition ''Blues for Charlie Parker,'' which he created extemporaneously at a concert in Yugoslavia in 1957, became his most-requested number. He also arranged hits like ''The Banana Boat Song (Day-O)'' for Harry Belafonte.In a profile of Mr. Scott in The New York Times in 1967, John S. Wilson described him ''playing his clarinet in his own uncompromisingly distinctive manner, a manner which encompasses both a feathery, light-as-air impressionism and an intense, emotional ferocity that makes the old-time 'hot' men sound as though they were blowing icicles.''By the end of the 1940s, the swing style popularized by Benny Goodman was on the wane, and the clarinet was falling out of favor as a jazz instrument. Mr. Scott persevered, touring Sweden, South Africa, Senegal, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and elsewhere. His 1964 album ''Music for Zen Meditation'' (Verve), a collaboration with traditional Japanese musicians, is considered an early example of New Age music.Among his other albums are ''The Touch of Tony Scott'' (RCA Victor, 1956); ''The Modern Art of Jazz'' (Seeco, 1957); ''Tony Scott in Afrika'' (A World of Music, 1997); and ''A Jazz Life'' (Kind of Blue), scheduled for release next month.Anthony Joseph Sciacca -- his family name is pronounced ''Shaka'' -- was born on June 17, 1921, in Morristown, N.J., to parents who had come from Sicily. His father was a barber and amateur guitarist; his mother played the violin. He began playing the clarinet at 12 and in 1942 earned a diploma from the Juilliard School.Mr. Scott's first two marriages ended in divorce. Besides his wife, the former Cinzia Bastianon, he is survived by two daughters from his second marriage, Monica Sciacca, a jazz singer, of Manhattan, and Nina Shaka of Paris; and one grandchild.During World War II, Mr. Scott was stationed with the Army on Governor's Island in New York. This meant he could spend many happy nights in Manhattan, playing the jazz clubs that lined West 52nd Street. He was such a ubiquitous presence there, Mr. Wilson wrote in The Times, that ''one night an out-of-town visitor, making his way down the street, began to worry about what the booze was doing to him because he noticed that, in club after club, the clarinetist always seemed to look the same.''</text></article><article id="1836840"><summary>J Paul Sticht, former chairman of R J Reynolds Industries, dies at age 89 (M)</summary><text>J. Paul Sticht, a former chairman of the tobacco company R. J. Reynolds Industries, now called Reynolds American, died Tuesday in Winston-Salem, N.C.He was 89. He lived in North Palm Beach, Fla., and had homes in Meredith, N.H., and Winston-Salem.Mr. Sticht died at the J. Paul Sticht Center on Aging and Rehabilitation at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, after being in poor health for several months, his son Mark said.As the first outsider to lead R. J. Reynolds, serving as its chairman three times during various permutations, Mr. Sticht led the company through a time of rapid diversification. He pushed into new markets overseas and added consumer-product companies like Heublein and Del Monte.''We developed from essentially a domestic to a broad-based international corporation,'' said Mr. Sticht when he announced his retirement from full-time work in December 1983. Sales at R. J. Reynolds had increased from $2.5 billion when he joined in 1972 to $15 billion.Born in western Pennsylvania, Mr. Sticht put himself through Grove City College, where he met his wife, Ferne, and graduated in 1939. After working with his father at a steel mill, he went on to work for a variety of companies, including Trans World Airlines, Campbell Soup and Federated Department Stores.At Federated, he was the first person outside the Lazarus family to become a major executive. Becoming president in 1967, he moved the company in new directions, including its purchase of a supermarket chain, according to his son, who had worked with his father when his father ran a small bottled-water company, Castle Springs.After joining R. J. Reynolds as an outside director in 1968 and becoming an executive later, Mr. Sticht was named president and chief operating officer in 1973, chief executive in 1978 and chairman in 1979.After retiring as a full-time executive in 1984, he was brought back briefly as chairman in 1987 and again in 1989, after the company, then RJR Nabisco, underwent a leveraged buyout.Mr. Sticht is survived by his wife; two sons, Mark, of Key West, Fla., and David, of Meredith, N.H.; four grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and a sister, Jean Mathews of Virginia Beach.</text></article><article id="1836841"><summary>Hy Weiss, music executive from early days of rock 'n' roll, dies at age 84 (M)</summary><text>Hy Weiss, a music executive from the hardscrabble early days of rock 'n' roll, died on March 20 in Englewood, N.J. He was 84 and lived in Rockleigh, N.J.His death was announced by the Zomba Label Group, of which his son, Barry Weiss, is president and chief executive.Born in Romania and raised in the Bronx, Mr. Weiss got his start as a salesman for R&amp;B labels like Modern and Exclusive. With his brother Sam he started a label, Old Town Records, in 1953, and they soon earned a reputation for their ears in signing talent as well as for their business tactics.Hy Weiss, who took control of the label in 1956, was an aggressive pitchman who bragged in print about using the ''$50 handshake,'' an important tool before the government crackdown on payola, when record men frequently offered enticements to radio stations to play their songs.''You didn't have to go out to dinner with someone,'' Mr. Weiss told Fredric Dannen in his 1990 book, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business.'' ''Just pay them, here's the money, play the record.''Old Town, based in a small office inside a movie theater on East 125th Street, borrowed its name from a wholesale paper company where Sam Weiss worked. But that was not all the Weiss brothers borrowed: to give their label the illusion of having a prestigious Madison Avenue address, they also used the paper company's stationery for their own business correspondence.Specializing in acts from Harlem and elsewhere around New York, Old Town released records that spanned doo-wop, pop, R&amp;B and blues.Among the label's hits were ''The Wedding,'' by the Solitaires; ''We Belong Together,'' by Robert and Johnny; ''So Fine,'' by the Fiestas; and Billy Bland's ''Let the Little Girl Dance,'' a No. 7 hit in 1960. They also recorded blues by artists like Willie Dixon and the duo Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Mr. Weiss wrote many of the songs released by Old Town and its subsidiary labels, including Barry, named after his son.The label's popularity declined with the growth of rock music in the '60s, though it had hits by the crooner Arthur Prysock.

That's nothing!On a recent (and mercifully short) late-night car-service ride in Park Slope, the driver had a laptop open on the passenger seat and was watching a bootlegged version of the new movie ''300.''To my horror, he had his attention fixed mostly on the screen. He was thoughtful enough to look up now and then to check the road.I guess he has yet to read the new research on the limits of multitasking.Wendy Blake  Brooklyn, March 26, 2007To the Editor:Experiments performed by psychologists about 50 years ago indicated that doing two tasks at once resulted in a reduction of an information-processing capacity of about 15 percent.Paul Muter  Toronto, March 25, 2007The writer is an assistant professor of psychology, University of Toronto.</text></article><article id="1836897"><summary>Letters from Inga Karliner and Timothy O Corkery comment on firing of eight US attorneys</summary><text>To the Editor:Re ''Ex-Aide Disputes Gonzales Stand Over Dismissals'' (front page, March 30):Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales says he didn't make the decision to fire the United States attorneys; he only signed on the decision.D. Kyle Sampson, his former chief of staff, brought the decision to Mr. Gonzales, but he says he didn't make the decision either. He thought that Mr. Gonzales had made the decision.So maybe this orphan decision should be reversed, the eight United States attorneys returned to their offices, and we can start over again?Inga Karliner  Urbana, Ill., March 30, 2007To the Editor:Re ''Story Time in the Senate'' (editorial, March 30):Let us not conflate the issue. Firing United States attorneys for political reasons is legal. For example, Attorney General Janet Reno fired 93 prosecutors in 1993, and there was no demand from Congress for an explanation.But dismissing United States attorneys for the purposes of squashing the investigation of a political ally is not permitted and should be investigated.Therefore, if there is evidence of corrupt motives in the firing of these eight prosecutors, then an investigation should be initiated.If the real story here is the Bush administration's incompetence in handling yet another episode of poor public relations (see the Scooter Libby trial), then it should suffer the resulting embarrassment (again) and the country should move forward.Timothy O.

Mugabe as its candidate in the 2008 presidential election, handing the 83-year-old leader a victory in a guerrilla battle within the party to force him into retirement. The party had rebuffed Mr. Mugabe's earlier effort to extend his current term to 2010, then found itself stymied when he reversed course and pledged to run in the already scheduled 2008 contest. Leaders from across southern Africa met with Mr. Mugabe in Tanzania this week, ostensibly to press him into retirement, but wound up publicly endorsing his rule of a nation with 1,700-percent-a-year inflation, 80 percent unemployment and one of the world's lowest life expectancies.MICHAEL WINES</text></article><article id="1836962"><summary>At least 14 people are killed in renewed clashes between Uzbek militants and local tribesmen in South Waziristan tribal region (S)</summary><text>At least 14 people were killed in renewed clashes between Uzbek militants and local tribesmen in the South Waziristan tribal region, officials said. The new fighting, over a hilltop, followed a four-day lull after more than 110 people were killed in a week. The tribesmen are trying to drive the outsiders, allies of the Taliban, out of Wana, South Waziristan's main town. While the government has refused to say that it is helping the locals try to oust the foreigners, said to be more than 1,000-strong, sources say it is.ISMAIL KHAN</text></article></root>
